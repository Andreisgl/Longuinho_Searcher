This SP system consists of a copolymer of acrylamide (AM) and acrylamido tertiary butyl sulfonate (ATBS) and sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) surfactant. Effects of surfactant concentration, temperature, polymer concentration, and salinity on rheological properties of SP system were investigated by means of oscillation and shear measurements. Comparison with classical partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM) was made. For the same temperature range, the viscosity drop for HPAM was about four times higher than the viscosity drop for ATBS-AM copolymer. In deionized water, viscosity of both polymers and SP systems was very high as compared to viscosity in saline water. Viscosity reduction of ATBS-AM copolymer was higher for salts having divalent cations.The SP system showed precipitation in presence of divalent cations. It worked well with monovalent cations even at relatively high salinities.The addition of 0.1% surfactant to the polymer resulted in a 60% decrease in the viscosity. Some interfacial rheological experiments were also carried out to investigate the behaviors on the interface between SP solutions and oil. Addition of 0.1% surfactant showed a 65% decrease in G󸀠 at SP solution-oil interface. SP system consisting of ATBS-AM and SDS showed better performance at high temperature compared to HPAM-SDS system. Due to precipitation, the SP system should be restricted to environment having low divalent cations.Save to LibraryDownloadby Muhammad Shahzad Kamal and +1Ibnelwaleed Hussein•  4  Surfactants, Viscosity, IOR / EOR, PolyacrylamidePolyacrylamide-controlled growth of centimeter-scaled polyaniline fibersSave to LibraryDownloadby 健銘 林•  14  Engineering, Morphology, Conducting Polymers, FiberSynthesis and characterization of polyaniline nanoparticles in SDS micellar solutionsSave to LibraryDownloadby Anku Agarwal•  42  Engineering, Materials Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Condensed Matter PhysicsEncapsulation of methylene blue in polyacrylamide nanoparticle platforms protects its photodynamic effectivenessSave to LibraryDownloadby Raoul Kopelman•  10  Nanoparticles, Biophysical Chemistry, Glioma, AnimalsInterfacial behaviour of crude oil/alkali systems in the presence of partially hydrolysed polyacrylamideSave to LibraryDownloadby Hisham  Nasr-El-Din•  4  Engineering, Physical sciences, CHEMICAL SCIENCES, PolyacrylamideRetention aid polymer interactions with cellulosic surfaces and suspensions: A reviewSave to LibraryDownloadby Hiroki Nanko•  5  Polyethylene oxide, Bridging, Flocculants, BioresourcesOptimisation de la polymérisation adiabatique de l'acrylamide -Hydrolyse basique et comportement en solution aqueuse des copolymèresSave to LibraryDownloadby Amine Zitouni•PolyacrylamidePreparation and photocatalytic degradability of TiO2/polyacrylamide compositeSave to LibraryDownloadby 健銘 林•  15  Materials Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Kinetics, Water TreatmentPolyaniline/polyacrylamide conducting composite hydrogel with a porous structureSave to LibraryDownloadby 健銘 林•  8  Organic Chemistry, Scanning Electron Microscopy, X ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopySynthesis and characterization of polyaniline prepared with the dopant mixture of (ZrO2/PbI2)Save to LibraryDownloadby lakshmi  GBVS•  42  Engineering, Materials Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Condensed Matter PhysicsSynthesis & characterization of thermo-responsive copolymeric nanoparticles of poly(methyl methacrylate-co-N-vinylcaprolactam)Save to LibraryDownloadby Sunil Shah•  60  Engineering, Materials Engineering, Materials Science, Organic ChemistryRole of polymeric dispersant functional groups in the dispersion behaviour of titania pigment particlesSave to LibraryDownloadby Daniel Fornasiero•  8  Rheology, Particle Size, Functional Group, Adsorption Isotherm ModelsOptimization of Phosphate and Anionic Polyacrylamide Flocculant (APF) Level for Sugar Cane Juice Clarification Using Central Composite DesignSave to LibraryDownloadby Rizka Pradana•  6  Mathematics, Chemistry, Flocculation, Food SciencesFormation and Performance Evaluation of Colloidal Dispersion Gels Prepared Using Sulfonated Polyacrylamides and Chromium (III) AcetateUsing a sulfonated polyacrylamide (SPAM) and Cr 3+ , a new colloidal dispersion gel (CDG) was prepared.

The viscosity of the CDG samples in different crosslinker concentrations and brine compositions was measured. The results showed that CDGs approach a Newtonian-like behavior in high crosslinker concentrations and salinities, signifying that they possess more rigid, less flexible particles that can be used to block some of the pore throats of the high-permeability layers. Therefore, three core flood tests were performed and the retention of the polymers and the final RRF values (residual resistance factor) were determined. Although CDGs showed a lower tendency to be adsorbed onto the rocks, they caused drastically higher RRF values (caused higher permeability reductions). Thus, it can be concluded that CDGs are superior compared to normal polymer solutions in modifying the permeability. Moreover, changing the post-flood fluid from brine to distilled water caused the RRF to decrease, hence a weaker effect on the permeability.Save to LibraryDownloadby Journal of Chemical and Petroleum Engineering (JChPE)•  5  Chromium, CDG, Polyacrylamide, Permeability ModificationSize Modulation of Polymeric Nanoparticles under Controlled Dynamics of Microemulsion DropletsPolyacrylamide nanoparticles of different size (&lt;100 nm) were prepared in reverse micelles under various dynamic conditions of micellar systems.

The nanoparticles were always larger than the aqueous core in which they were formed; however, the size of the nanoparticles could be controlled if the interdroplet interaction and coalescence rate in reverse micelles were regulated.

The flocs produced with polyacrylamide may be deposited into retention areas that become anaerobic. Although it is unlikely that the carbon backbone of these polymers would be cleaved by microbial activity, the amide group could serve as a nitrogen source for microorganisms. Previous studies have shown that aerobic bacteria utilize the nitrogen from polyacrylamide. This study assessed whether methanogenesis was stimulated when an anionic polyacrylamide (Magnafloc LT27AG) was the sole fixed nitrogen source in serum-bottle microcosms. Microorganisms from two oil sands tailings sources, and a domestic anaerobic sewage sludge were used, with benzoate or acetate provided as carbon and energy sources.

Oppositely charged flocculants, a polyacrylamide (PAM)-typed anionic and two poly diallyl-dimethyl-ammonium chloride (polyDADMAC)-typed cationic polymers, were employed for the flocculation. Tailings slurry samples were taken on different dates from the discharge point of Kırka Borax Concentrator. Flocculation performance was characterized by the initial settling rate as well as the residual turbidity of supernatant and the extent of sediment compaction. All tests were performed at the natural pH of the tailings slurry (~pH 9.4) at which borax buffered the suspension. The results showed that an increase in solid load of the tailings slurry results in a dramatic decrease in settling rate of flocculated tailings regardless of flocculant system employed. This can be attributed to the possible change in rheological property of the slurry due to the increasing clay content of the slurry with solid ratio. While the solid ratio has an influence on the settling rate of the flocculated tailings, the amount of slimes determines the optimum dosage of cationic flocculant to obtain clear supernatant in dual-flocculant system. When anionic and cationic flocculants were used in combination, the best synergy was achieved with low weight cationic flocculant. Increasing molecular weight of the cationic flocculant from low to medium resulted in twofold increase in the required dosage to obtain the same flocculation performance. In dualflocculant system, optimum results were obtained by anionic and cationic flocculant combination at around 0.4 kg/ton and 0.8 kg/ton solid dosages, respectively, indicating 11.7 cm/min of settling rate and 85.7% of transmittance value.Save to LibraryDownloadby Avanti Publisher and +1Nuray KARAPINAR•  6  Earth Sciences, Flocculation, Borax, PolyacrylamideSynthesis and characterization of polyacrylamide–nickel amorphous nanocomposites by γ-irradiationSave to LibraryDownloadby Zhicheng Zhang•  4  Engineering, Nanocomposites, CHEMICAL SCIENCES, PolyacrylamideThe effects of polymer properties on DNA separations by capillary electrophoresis in uncross‐linked polymer solutionsSave to LibraryDownloadby Annelise  Barron•  11  Chemical Engineering, Analytical Chemistry, Capillary electrophoresis, PolymersEffects of artificial amendments in potting media on Orthosiphon aristatus growth and developmentSave to LibraryDownloadby Ta Nguyen•  24  Foam, Growth, Growth and development, Water StressPoly(acrylamide/laponite) nanocomposite hydrogels: Swelling and cationic dye adsorption propertiesSave to LibraryDownloadby Nam Hoon  Kim•  9  Engineering, Heat Treatment, Hydrogels, AdsorptionSynthesis of Au, Ag and Au–Ag alloy nanoparticles in aqueous polymer solutionSave to LibraryDownloadby Angshuman Pal•  12  Engineering, Nanoparticle, Nanoparticles, Gold nanoparticleHydrogel-based protein array for quantifying epidermal growth factor receptor activity in cell lysatesSave to LibraryDownloadby Sean Palecek•  20  Analytical Chemistry, Hydrogels, Gene expression, Cell lineSwelling and contraction driven mass transfer processes during osmotic dehydration of uncharged hydrogelsSave to LibraryDownloadby ory ramon•  6  Mass Transfer, Food Science and Technology, Osmotic pressure, Osmotic DehydrationDrying and storage of polyacrylamide slab gels: A simple procedureA simple procedure for drying and storing of polyacrylamide slab gels is described.
