The Hebrew Wikisource already started a year ago, before all the other languages. We are continuing as usual, and several new contributors recently joined. Now that the other languages have been set up we are starting to link our texts to theirs and back. We are also starting to link to Hebrew Wikipedia more, because when the rest of the languages were set up our interwiki links were fixed as well!
he:User:Rotemliss has worked very hard over the past couple of days putting together an array of templates for the language proficiency of contributors, to use on their personal pages.  Now we'll know how truly mutlilingual we really are at he:. Dovi 14:07, 21 December 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply]

The korean main page has a nice animated gif: a fish swarm! I looooove it :-) It is original, goes well with the iceberg, and totally non-conventional when you realize that we're selling books :-) I wonder if the same gif will not show up on the french main page from time to time ThomasV 19:55, 17 September 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply]

Lots of activity and a beautiful new Main Page on de.wikisource.
Lots of activity and a beautiful new Main Page on fr.wikisource
Lots of activity by high-quality contributors (especially notable because some doubt was expressed about the need for a Latin wiki) and a beautiful new Main Page on la.wikisource.
