Values of the magnetic susceptibility at ambient temperature show that the core encompasses four climatic stages: the Warming Present (WP), the Little Ice Age (Late LIA), Early Little Ice Age (ELIA), and the Medieval Climate Anomalies (MCA). Added to the subcycles, the spectral analysis shows the individualization of an 888 yr cycle probably related to solar activity. The heating at 250°C is good-for-nothing since it was useful neither for climatic investigation nor for tephras layers detection. Heating at 700°C generated the complete loss of the climatic signal. On the other hand, it allowed the detection of the previously identified tephras layers. Further, it highlighted the presence of other tephras layers. The extraction by the bromoform confirms the presence of these tephras.

Eighty-three MT stations were deployed along a SW-NE sixty-three kilometre long profile. 2D MT inversions of a sub-section of the profile reveal high conductivity layers at the expected depth of the Posidonia black shale, interrupted by a 10km wide resistive body. We speculate that the high electrical conductivity is due to electrolytic conduction through water filled pores and is interrupted by the known Zechstein Husum salt diapir. In addition to MT, we also made electrical resistivity measurements on a series of black shale samples from boreholes located in the Hils Syncline, Germany, and the Barnett shale from Texas, USA. Our results indicate that black shales are electrically resistive for low maturity states. Their electrical resistivity is generally anisotropic and porosity controlled.

The metals concentrations were determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry.  The results show that iron had the highest concentration in all the soils and can be represented in the following order: Fe &gt; Zn &gt; Pb &gt; Ni &gt; Mn &gt; Cr. The heavy metals concentrations were found to be higher in the roadside soils as compared with the control samples. Thus, the metals concentrations decrease with increase in distance away from the parks.Save to LibraryDownloadby Dr. Wilson Lamayi Danbature•  5  Environmental Science, Environmental Chemistry, Heavy metals, Atomic Absorption SpectroscopyMagnetic signature of overbank sediment in industry impacted floodplains identified by data mining methodsSave to LibraryDownloadby Simon M Hutchinson•  9  Environmental Science, Geology, Geophysics, Cluster AnalysisScientific drilling workshop on the Weihe Basin Drilling Project (WBDP): Cenozoic tectonic–monsoon interactionsSave to LibraryDownloadby john dodson•  5  Earth Sciences, Geology, Drilling, CenozoicApplication of multiple proxies in Mexican tropical coasts to prove evidence of tsunami depositsSave to LibraryDownloadby Nestor Corona•  7  Geography, Geology, Geophysics, TsunamiA paleomagnetic study of the Pohue Bay flow and its associated coastal cones, Mauna Loa volcano, Hawaii: constraints on their origin and temporal relationshipsSave to LibraryDownloadby Jaime Urrutia Fucugauchi•  8  Geology, Geochemistry, Geophysics, PaleomagnetismPaleomagnetism of Ar-Ar dated lava flows from the Ceboruco-San Pedro volcanic field (western Mexico): Evidence for the Matuyama-Brunhes transition precursor and a fully reversed geomagnetic event in the Brunhes chronSave to LibraryDownloadby Jaime Urrutia Fucugauchi•  20  Geology, Mineralogy, Paleontology, PaleomagnetismFurther reliability tests for determination of palaeointensities of the Earth's magnetic fieldSave to LibraryDownloadby Jaime Urrutia Fucugauchi•  7  Geology, Geophysics, Magnetic field, Archaeomagnetic DatingA detailed paleomagnetic and rock-magnetic investigation of the Matuyama-Brunhes geomagnetic reversal recorded in the tephra-paleosol sequence of Tlaxcala (Central Mexico)Save to LibraryDownloadby Jaime Urrutia Fucugauchi•  12  Engineering, Earth Sciences, Geology, GeophysicsCooling rate corrected paleointensities from the Xitle lava flow: Evaluation of within-site scatter for single spot-reading cooling unitsThe historic Xitle lava, which covers a great part of southern Mexico City, is one of the most studied (magnetically) volcanic unit worldwide.

Studies include detailed paleomagnetic and paleointensity investigations, which have documented an enigmatic within-flow variation of absolute paleointensity first recognized in the decade of 1960s. However, attempts to find possible explanations in terms of physical/magnetic parameters or geomagnetic effects have been unsatisfactory. As an effort to understand the over- and underestimating of geomagnetic paleointensity (PI) within the Xitle lava flow, we investigated the relation of the cooling rate upon the acquisition of thermoremanent magnetization (TRM). Contrary to archaeomagnetic investigations, most paleointensity experiments on volcanic rocks do not consider cooling rate effects in a systematic manner.

The ash has been dated at 40 ka by optically stimulated luminescence analysis, thereby providing new evidence that America was colonized earlier than the Clovis culture (about 13.5 Ma). We carried out paleomagnetic and rock magnetic analysis on 18 Xalnene ash block and core samples collected at two distinct localities and 19 standard paleomagnetic cores belonging to nearby monogenetic volcanoes. Our data provide evidence that both the volcanic lava flow and Xalnene ash were emplaced during the Laschamp geomagnetic event spanning from about 45 to 39 ka.Save to LibraryDownloadby Jaime Urrutia Fucugauchi•  10  Earth Sciences, Geology, Paleontology, PaleomagnetismMagnetic characterization of Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary sedimentsSave to LibraryDownloadby Jaime Urrutia Fucugauchi•  12  Geology, Geochemistry, Paleomagnetism, Planetary ScienceHysteresis properties of chondritic meteorites: New results for chondrules from the Allende meteorite2002 Daniel Flores Gutiérrez / Jaime Urrutia Fucugauchi HYSTERESIS PROPERTIES OF CHONDRITIC METEORITES: NEW RESULTS FOR CHONDRULES FROM THE ALLENDE METEORITE Geofísica Internacional, april-june, año/vol. 41, número 002 Universidad... more2002 Daniel Flores Gutiérrez / Jaime Urrutia Fucugauchi HYSTERESIS PROPERTIES OF CHONDRITIC METEORITES: NEW RESULTS FOR CHONDRULES FROM THE ALLENDE METEORITE Geofísica Internacional, april-june, año/vol. 41, número 002 Universidad Nacional Autónoma de ...Save to LibraryDownloadby Daniel Flores Gutierrez•  9  Geology, Geophysics, Rock magnetism, ChondrulesDetermination of the spinel group end-members based on electron microprobe analysesSave to LibraryDownloadby María Florencia  Gargiulo•  10  Geology, Mineralogy, EMPA, Electron Microprobe EMPARodingite from Nasławice and the other occurrences of these rocks in Lower Silesia (SW Po land)Rodingites from Naslawice of the Jordanow-Gogolow serpentinite massif in SW Poland are composed of augite/diopside, grossular and hornblende/tremolite.

The accessory components are represented by vesuvianite, adularia, basaltic hornblende and picotite. Apatite, millerite?, sphalerite, galena, Fe-sulphides, Ni-sulphides and Ni-arsenates were also observed as trace phases in these rocks. Generally, rodingites from Naslawice are enriched in numerous polymetallic compounds of Cu, Ag, Fe, Ni, Co, Fe, Pb, Zn, As and Bi, and show a similar mineral association and texture as rodingites from the other occurrences in SW Poland, i.e. from the Szklary and Braszowice-Brzeznica massifs. They most probably developed from a mafic protolith (fine-grained gabbro) intruding into serpentinized ultramafic rocks under metasomatism conditions. The secondary pneumo-hydrothermal post-granitic activities also affected the final formation of these metasomatic rocks.Save to LibraryDownloadby Lucyna Natkaniec-Nowak•  5  Geology, Geochemistry, Metasomatism, GabbroFinding the right rocks on MarsSave to LibraryDownloadby Morten Bo Madsen•  5  Geology, Astrobiology, Magnetic field, Solar SystemThe Ferrigmagnetic Phase in Nakhla and Zagmi--Implications for the Martian FinesSave to LibraryDownloadby Morten Bo Madsen•  2  Geology, LPICaracterización magnética y datación preliminar mediante paleointensidades relativas de sedimentos lacustres de la Formación Tajamar (Guachipas), Salta, ArgentinaThis paper presents a detailed study of rock magnetism in lacustrine sediments from three sample sequences from the Pleistocene Tajamar Formation, exposed in an outcrop near the locality of Guachipas (25º31.0’S 65°30.5’W), in Salta... moreThis paper presents a detailed study of rock magnetism in lacustrine sediments from three sample sequences from the Pleistocene Tajamar Formation, exposed in an outcrop near the locality of Guachipas (25º31.0’S 65°30.5’W), in Salta Province, Argentina. The studied sediments are located in the drainage of the Guachipas River, which drains Meso-Cenozoic outcrops that border the southern end of the Lerma Valley. The studied samples showed a stable remanent magnetization that was obtained after removing a viscous remanent magnetization with alternating fields of about 10-15 mT. The magnetic properties indicate that the main carrier of remanence is magnetite with the presence of hematite in different percentages. Magnetite samples have magnetic grain sizes between 4 and 16 mm. The magnetic concentration parameters have the same variations as the stable remanent magnetization suggesting the signal is dominated by this magnetic parameter.

The study aimed to constrain the role of an external applied magnetic field on the alignment of magnetosome chains in Magnetospirillum magneticum AMB-1 magnetotactic bacteria immobilized within a hydrated silica matrix. A deviation of the chain orientation was evidenced, without significant impact on cell viability, which was preserved after the field was turned-off. Transmission electron microscopy showed that the crystallographic orientation of the nanoparticles within the chains were preserved. Off-axis electron holography evidenced that the change in magnetosome orientation was accompanied by a shift from parallel to anti-parallel interactions between individual nanocrystals.

While the aftermath of the initial impact would have produced harmful levels of radiation sufficient for eradicating a large portion of terrestrial life, this process does not explain the concurrent marine extinction. Following the primary impact, a large quantity of smaller spherules would de-orbit and re-enter the earths atmosphere, dispersed nearly uniformly across the planet. This secondary wave of debris would re-enter at high velocities, altering the chemical composition of the atmosphere. Furthermore, the combined surface area for the spherules would be much larger than for the original asteroid, resulting in considerably more potential reactions. For this reason, a new method was developed for predicting the total amount of toxic species produced by the spherule re-entry phase of the Chicxulub event.

The magnetic results elucidate the dominance of magnetic grain size in the lower estuary, magnetic concentration in the middle, and magnetic mineral in the upper estuary, respectively. The magnetic parameters confirm the presence of ferrimagnetic minerals such as magnetite in the estuary. The geochemical elements affinity attribute towards the lower estuary. Further, intense weathering in the lower estuary and moderate to weak weathering in the middle and upper estuary are observed which is reflected in the micro-texture features of quartz grains.

We have conducted a... moreThe recent discovery of a possible Late Cambrian true polar wander (TPW) from the Jiangshan section in eastern South China has intrigued us to test this TPW in other continuous, well-dated Upper Cambrian successions. We have conducted a detailed paleomagnetic study of a continuous Upper Cambrian succession in Wa'ergang, Hunan Province, middle South China, that contains well-defined trilobite zones correlative with those of the Jiangshan section. Three remanence components were isolated from the Upper Cambrian limestone. The low-and intermediate-temperature components represent a recent viscous magnetization and a Cretaceous remagnetization, respectively. The high-temperature component passes fold tests, but its pole lies close to the Middle Triassic pole of South China, indicating a Middle Triassic remagnetization. Rock magnetic analyses and petrographic observations indicate that the high-temperature component resides in small framboidal magnetite aggregates that were formed via alteration and replacement of pyrite and represents a chemical remagnetization. This Middle Triassic remagnetization and previously recognized Triassic remagnetization exhibit a younging trend from the east to the west of South China. The widespread Triassic remagnetization was likely associated with the Indosinian orogeny during which the scissor-like suturing processes between the South and North China Blocks and the accompanying so-called squeegeed orogenic fluids led to progressively westward younging remagnetization in South China. Although the new paleomagnetic results do not allow us to effectively test the Late Cambrian TPW due to the thorough remagnetization, these data provide important insights into understanding the Early Mesozoic remagnetization and associated geological processes.Save to LibraryDownloadby Yong-Xiang Li•RemagnetizationPaleomagnetism of a well-dated marine succession in South China: A possible Late Cambrian true polar wander (TPW)The Cambrian true polar wander (TPW) hypothesis remains controversial largely because of the uncertainties in the quality and/or fidelity of the paleomagnetic data as well as their chronological control. Testing the TPW hypothesis... moreThe Cambrian true polar wander (TPW) hypothesis remains controversial largely because of the uncertainties in the quality and/or fidelity of the paleomagnetic data as well as their chronological control. Testing the TPW hypothesis requires high-quality paleomagnetic data of sufficient spatial and temporal resolutions. Here, we present paleomagnetic results of a continuous Cambrian shallow marine succession from South China where available detailed biostratigraphy provides exceptional chronological constraints. Forty-three sites of paleomagnetic samples were collected from this limestone-dominated succession. Stepwise thermal demagnetization generally reveals three-component magnetizations. Low-and intermediate-temperature components can be cleaned by ∼330°C, and the high-temperature component (HTC) was isolated typically from ∼350 to ∼450°C. A positive fold test and the presence of reversed polarity in the strata, together with rock magnetic data as well as the scanning electron microscopic (SEM) and transmission electron microscopic (TEM) results, collectively suggest that the HTCs are likely primary. A directional shift of the HTCs occurs between the lower-middle Cambrian and the upper Cambrian strata in the succession and is tentatively interpreted to indicate a ∼57°polar wander from ∼500.5 to 494 Ma. Because the rate of polar wander is too fast to be a tectonic origin, this polar wander is interpreted to represent a Late Cambrian TPW. This TPW appears coeval with the Steptoean positive carbon isotope excursion (SPICE) and the major trilobite mass extinctions, suggesting a potential link between the TPW and the Late Cambrian biotic and climatic changes. Because the proposed TPW event is exceptionally well-dated, it should be testable through examination of other worldwide sections.Save to LibraryDownloadby Yong-Xiang Li•Structural geological evidence from ODP Leg 131 regarding fluid flow in the Nankai prism, JapanSave to LibraryDownloadby Alex Maltman•  12  Earth Sciences, Geology, Petrology, SeismologySecond-order magnetic phase transition in the EarthSave to LibraryDownloadby László Szarka•  14  Geology, Geophysics, Materials Science, MagnetotelluricAURORAE ΑND ARCHAEOMAGNETISM FROM THE 1 st MILLENNIUM B.C.

It is shown that the expected auroral oval with its extension to a maximum of radius 30 o around the GP occasionally reaches the Chinese / Southern Mediterranean mid latitudes and eastern longitudes: for China 35 ο-40 ο and 95 ο-125 ο respectively, and for Greece/Central Italy, 35 ο-40 ο and 10 ο-25 ο respectively; two distant regions where two great cultures flourished. Of the nine Chinese records those of 1000-900 B.C., 687 B.C., 193 B.C., 139 B.C., 32 B.C., 30 B.C. and 15 B.C. records are justified by a mid latitude geomagnetic pole which gives certain mid latitude aurorae. For the 166 B.C. and 154 B.C. available archaeomagnetic data the position of the VGP does not justify observation of aurorae. Archaeomagnetic data for Chinese accounts derived from South Korea, Japan and England reduced to mid China location are also used to determine GP at a reduced site of common latitude in China, but due attention and discussion of non-dipole magnetic sources and their calculated drift rates is made, to explain the unattainable observation of aurorae at central Chinese latitudes. Similarly, in southern Eastern Mediterranean area (Greece, Italy) 33 data are used and most are commensurable with the inclined GP towards mid latitudes, included within the auroral oval or at its southern maximum extension taking into account associated errors. Highly acceptable aurorae accounts and problematic ones are explained in terms of smooth or rapid, respectively, changes in the magnetic inclination and declination positions, reinforced by large age errors. Virtual Geomagnetic poles (VGP) for examined regions are ranging between 51 o to 71 o for latitude and between 1 o to 123 o for longitude for auroral observation dates of the 1st millennium B.C. to 1 st century A.D.Save to LibraryDownloadby BC.

These sections are characterized by a low concentration of ferrimagnetic material, the destruction of the primary sedimentary magnetic texture, which makes them unsuitable for qualitative magnetostratigraphic studies.

Titanium-rich titanomagnetite and titanium-poor titanomagnetite were the dominant magnetic minerals in the samples where titanium-rich titanomagnetite was more dominant. From the rock magnetic measurements, parameters such as the saturation remanent magnetization (Mrs), saturation magnetization (Ms), coercivity (Bc), and titanium content estimated from the Curie temperature (Tc) were extracted and checked for their temporal changes. The magnetic behavior of the magnetic minerals was confirmed by the increasing values of Mrs/Ms and Bc at several periods. The samples with higher values of Mrs/Ms and Bc included titanomagnetite with a low Tc (high titanium content).
