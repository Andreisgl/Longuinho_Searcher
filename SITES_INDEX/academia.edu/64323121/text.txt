There remain many questions about the semantics of timbres and textures arising from orchestral combinations: for example, what leads orchestration pedagogue Samuel Adler (2002) to describe some orchestral textures as “flickering” while others are “noble,” “bombastic,” or “muddy”? Semantics of combinations of timbres and textures are germane to ecologically valid experiences of music, especially ensemble music. They also complement the much-discussed gray area between timbre and harmony (e.g., Hasegawa 2009; Harvey 2000) with another equally fascinating liminality: between timbre and texture.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersPsychology of MusicA Corpus Analysis of Timbre Semantics in Orchestration Treatises2019 • Zachary WallmarkWhat does the common descriptive lexicon for instrumental sound tell us about how we conceptualize musical timbre? Perceptual studies have revealed a number of verbal attributes that reliably map onto timbral qualities, but the conventions of timbre description in spoken and written discourse remain poorly understood. Books on orchestration provide a valuable source of natural language about instrumental timbre. This article uses methods from corpus linguistics to explore the semantic features of timbre through a quantitative analysis of 11 orchestration treatises and manuals. Findings reveal a relatively constrained vocabulary for timbre: about 50 adjectives account for half of all descriptions in the corpus. The timbre lexicon can be categorized according to affect, matter, metaphor, mimesis, action, acoustics, and onomatopoeia, and further reduced to three latent conceptual dimensions, which are labeled and discussed. Descriptive patterns vary systematically by instrument and instrument family, suggesting certain regularities and consistencies to timbre description in the orchestral tradition. This study helps test the long-held assumption that conventions of timbre description are vague and unsystematic, and offers a cognitive linguistic account of the timbre-language connection.Download Free PDFView PDFMusic & ScienceSemantic Crosstalk in Timbre Perception2019 • Zachary WallmarkMany adjectives for musical timbre reflect cross-modal correspondence, particularly with vision and touch (e.g., "dark-bright," "smooth-rough"). Although multisensory integration between visual/tactile processing and hearing has been demonstrated for pitch and loudness, timbre is not well understood as a locus of cross-modal mappings. Are people consistent in these semantic associations? Do cross-modal terms reflect dimensional interactions in timbre processing? Here I designed two experiments to investigate crosstalk between timbre semantics and perception through the use of Stroop-type speeded classification. Experiment 1 found that incongruent pairings of instrument timbres and written names caused significant Stroop-type interference relative to congruent pairs, indicating bidirectional crosstalk between semantic and auditory modalities. Pre-Experiment 2 asked participants to rate natural and synthesized timbres on semantic differential scales capturing luminance (brightness) and texture (roughness) associations, finding substantial consistency for a number of timbres. Acoustic correlates of these associations were also assessed, indicating an important role for high-frequency energy in the intensity of cross-modal ratings. Experiment 2 used timbre adjectives and sound stimuli validated in the previous experiment in two variants of a semantic-auditory Stroop-type task. Results of linear mixed-effects modeling of reaction time and accuracy showed slight interference in semantic processing when adjectives were paired with cross-modally incongruent instrument timbres (e.g., the word "smooth" with a "rough" timbre). Taken together, I conclude by suggesting that semantic crosstalk in timbre processing may be partially automatic and could reflect weak synesthetic congruency between interconnected sensory domains.Download Free PDFView PDFPsychomusicology: Music, Mind, and Brain Creating Novel Tones From Adjectives: An Exploratory Study Using FM Synthesis2019 • Zachary WallmarkPerceptual studies of timbre semantics have revealed certain consistencies in the linguistic conceptualization of acoustic attributes. In the standard experimental paradigm, participants hear timbral stimuli and provide behavioral responses. However, it remains unclear the extent to which descriptive consistency would be observed if this paradigm were reversed, that is, if participants were instructed to create novel timbres in response to target adjectives. Given an unfamiliar synthesis interface, would musically trained participants craft similar timbral profiles for the same familiar adjectives? In this study, we explore timbre semantics using a novel frequency modulation (FM) synthesis production task. Participants (N=64) created unique timbral outputs in response to 20 common timbre descriptors drawn from orchestration treatises (e.g., brilliant, dull, harsh). Acoustic analyses of the resultant 1,280 signals, in conjunction with linear mixed-effects modeling and clustering analysis, indicate that participants were moderately consistent in their timbral creations. Word valence and arousal interacted to influence average spectral centroid and noisiness. Specifically, clearly positive and negative words produced significantly different acoustical profiles than more affectively neutral words. This result confirms a number of findings from the perceptual literature while offering preliminary evidence that affective dimensions of timbre semantics systematically influence sound production in an unfamiliar context.Download Free PDFView PDFOxford Handbook of TimbreDescribing Sound: The Cognitive Linguistics of TimbreZachary WallmarkTimbre exists at the confluence of the physical and the perceptual, and due to inconsistencies between these frames, it is notoriously hard to describe. This chapter examines the relationship between timbre and language, offering a critical review of theoretical and empirical thought on timbre semantics and providing a preliminary cognitive linguistic account of timbre description. It first traces the major conceptual and methodological advances in psychological timbre research since the 1970s with a focus on the mediating role of verbalization in previous paradigms. It then discusses the cognitive mechanisms underlying how listeners map timbral qualities onto verbal attributes. Applying a cognitive linguistic approach, the chapter concludes that timbre description may reflect certain fundamental aspects of human embodiment, which may help account for certain trans-historical and cross-cultural consistencies in descriptive practices.Download Free PDFView PDFIdentifying the Perceptual Dimensions of Musical Instrument Timbre2018 • Lindsey ReymoreDifferent musical instruments do not simply exhibit different musical timbres; they also evoke different phenomenological experiences, or "musical instrument qualia." Informal descriptions of instrument sounds seem to employ stereotypical characterizations, such as "airy" for a flute or "heavy" for a tuba. Previous research has sought to identify dimensions of timbre through listener judgments of paired comparisons (Grey, 1977, Kendall et al., 1999). Investigations into the semantic dimensions of timbre demonstrate that a number of descriptive terms map consistently onto particular acoustic correlates of timbre (e.g. Zacharkakis, Pastiadis, & Reiss, 2014). This three-part project aims to develop a model of the dimensions of musical instrument qualia. Results of the first two studies are reported here. In the first study, interviews were conducted with professional and semi-professional musicians in which they were asked to open-endedly describe the sounds of different musical instruments. Responses were subjected to content analysis using a pile-sort method, yielding an initial list of categories of musical instrument qualia. To test the reliability and usefulness of the dimensions yielded from the first study, the second study asked participants to rate musical instrument sounds according to the pile-sorted categories. Principal components analysis suggests ways in which categories with significant overlapping variance can be collapsed; preliminary results of this analysis are presented here. In the last stage of the study (not reported here), participants will rate an expanded number of instruments according to each of the dimensions in the final PCA model; these results will then be used to generate perceptual profiles for the most common Western musical instruments.Download Free PDFView PDFAnalyse musicale et perception: Actes des Journées d'Analyse Musicale 2016, Editions universitaires de Dijon.Perceptual Facets of Orchestration in The Angel of Death by Roger Reynolds: Timbre and Auditory Grouping2019 • Moe TouizrarDownload Free PDFView PDFDissertation, McGill UniversityFrom Ekphrasis to Apperception: The Sunlight Topic in Orchestral Music2019 • Moe TouizrarIn recent musicology, scholars have identified the sun—and its light—as a topic of musical discourse. Despite these latest albeit brief mentions, no scholar has expounded or populated the topic beyond a few isolated cases, let alone offered speculation as to how the compelling analogy between light and sonorous expression might operate, either in the hands of the composer or in the mind of the listener. Unlike most other musical topoi, light and its modulations exist as conspicuously visual phenomena, and this raises an important question about how depictive topoi are perceived when listening to music: what does it mean to hear a sunrise? And, why might composers develop similar strategies concerning orchestral timbre and form in order to convey an experience devoid of sound? The dissertation examines orchestral depictions of sunrise and sunset from an interdisciplinary vantage point, by first proposing similarities and continuities between the ancient literary theory (rhetorical device or exercise) of ekphrasis on the one hand, and the evolution of the modern philosophical and psychological term ‘apperception’ on the other hand. Taken together, I argue that these seemingly unrelated modes of thought suggest the possibility for a theory of enargeia (vivacity) in music. Moreover, by considering recent developments in the perceptual study of timbre and orchestration, I propose several apperceptive features of orchestral sunrises and sunsets that demonstrate the enargic (vivid) capacity of orchestral sonority within such depictive contexts. The final chapter comprises analyses of exemplary orchestral works by Bartók, Ravel, Rimsky-Korsakov, and Schoenberg.Download Free PDFView PDFMusic PerceptionDoes Timbre Modulate Visual Perception? Exploring Crossmodal Interactions2021 • Zachary WallmarkMusical timbre is often described using terms from non-auditory senses, mainly vision and touch; but it is not clear whether crossmodality in timbre semantics reflects multisensory processing or simply linguistic convention. If multisensory processing is involved in timbre perception, the mechanism governing the interaction remains unknown. To investigate whether timbres commonly perceived as ‘‘bright-dark’’ facilitate or interfere with visual perception (darkness- brightness), we designed two speeded classification experiments. Participants were presented consecutive images of slightly varying (or the same) brightness along with task-irrelevant auditory primes (‘‘bright’’ or ‘‘dark’’ tones) and asked to quickly identify whether the second image was brighter/darker than the first. Incongruent prime-stimulus combinations produced significantly more response errors compared to congruent combinations but choice reaction time was unaffected. Furthermore, responses in a deceptive identical-image condition indicated subtle semantically congruent response bias. Additionally, in Experiment 2 (which also incorporated a spatial texture task), measures of reaction time (RT) and accuracy were used to construct speed-accuracy tradeoff functions (SATFs) in order to critically compare two hypothesized mechanisms for timbre-based crossmodal interactions, sensory response change vs. shift in response criterion. Results of the SATF analysis are largely consistent with the response criterion hypothesis, although without conclusively ruling out sensory change.Download Free PDFView PDFAn interlanguage study of musical timbre semantic dimensions and their acoustic correlatesAsterios Zacharakis, Joshua D Reiss, Asteris Zacharakis, Konstantinos PastiadisA study of musical timbre was conducted with listeners from two different linguistic groups. In two separate experiments, native Greek and English speaking participants were asked to describe 23 musical instrument tones of variable pitch using a predefined vocabulary of 30 adjectives. The common experimental protocol facilitated the investigation of the influence of language on musical timbre semantics by allowing for direct comparisons between linguistic groups. Data reduction techniques applied to the data of each group revealed three salient semantic dimen- sions that shared common conceptual properties between linguistic groups namely: luminance, texture, and mass. The results supported universality of timbre semantics. A correlation analysis between physical characteristics and semantic dimensions associated: i) texture with the energy distribution of harmonic partials, ii) thickness (a term related to either mass or luminance) and brilliance with inharmonicity and spectral centroid variation, and iii) F0 with mass or luminance depending on the linguistic group.Download Free PDFView PDFThe Journal of the Acoustical Society of AmericaPerceptual evaluation of violins: A psycholinguistic analysis of preference verbal descriptions by experienced musicians2017 • Catherine GuastavinoIn this paper, how the notion of violin quality is conveyed in spontaneous verbalizations by experienced violinists during preference judgments is investigated. The aims of the study were to better understand how musicians conceptualize violin quality, what aspects of the sound and the playing experience are essential, and what associations are formed between perceptual evaluation and physical description. Upon comparing violins of varying make and age, players were interviewed about their preferences using open-ended questions. Concepts of violin quality were identified and categorized based on the syntactic and linguistic analysis of musicians&#39; responses. While perceived variations in how a violin sounds and feels, and consequently conceptualization structures, rely on the variations in style and expertise of different violinists, the broader semantic categories emerging from sensory descriptions remain common across performers with diverse musical profiles, reflecting a share...Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
