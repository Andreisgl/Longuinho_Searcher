The first section examines the evolution of the cultural policy agenda in the 40-odd years since the independence era. It traces and analyses the policy trajectory from one that sought to promote the intrinsic values of culture, to one that currently espouses the more instrumental value of the cultural industries. The next section analyses the efficacy of the policy path by examining a regional cultural policy initiative, the Caribbean Festival for the Arts (CARIFESTA). The paper suggests that the Caribbean cultural policies have under performed because of critical disjunctures. These generally involve the imposition of a nationalistic policy framework on the transnational structure of the Caribbean cultural sector. The paper concludes by suggesting a regional cultural approach to policy formulation can provide a more effective mechanism to encourage and harness the cultural wealth of the Anglophone Caribbean. The Anglophone Caribbean 1 is perhaps best known for its dynamic cultural expressions , and the wealth of its cultural assets and resources. From the musical stylings of reggae icon Bob Marley, to the poetic musings of Nobel Laureate Derek Walcott, and the splendor of Trinidad and Tobago's overseas Carnival complex, the cultural products of the Caribbean have secured a place in the global cultural marketplace. In the 40-odd years since the region's independence from Britain, many aspects of Caribbean culture are clearly discernible in global entertainment products including music, film and video, and the visual arts. However, these accomplishments have occurred in large part, without the sustained benefit of local and regional cultural policy support. Notwithstanding the ongoing pronouncements of successive political regimes regarding the central role of culture, and more specifically, of cultural policies in the overall development of the region, the Anglo-phone Caribbean has acquired a poor record of cultural policy activation. With the possible exception of Jamaica, and more latterly Barbados and St Lucia, few countries in the region have developed clearly articulated policy positions. 2 What has emerged in the post independence period is a set of practices, programmes, and texts that are philosophically grounded in a nationalist framework, and activated through the Ministries of Culture and other public sector agencies. This approach to cultural policy development has yieldedDownload Free PDFView PDFBarbados: Caribbean Export Development AgencyThe Caribbean Music Industry2001 • Keith NurseDownload Free PDFView PDFTOPIA 20 65LARSON PHIPPSDownload Free PDFView PDFTHE CULTURAL INDUSTRIES IN CARICOM2006 • Keith NurseDownload Free PDFView PDFMultilateral Trade Policy and the Caribbean Music SectorSuzanne BurkeDownload Free PDFView PDFStrategic Plan for the Music and Entertainment Industries of Trinidad and TobagoJo-anne TullDownload Free PDFView PDFUniversity of the West Indies, Trinidad and TobagoThe Cultural Industries and Sustainable Development in Small Island Developing States2007 • Keith NurseDownload Free PDFView PDFMUSICulturesSounding the "6ix": Drake, Cultural Appropriation, and Embodied Caribbeanization2019 • Ryan  PersadieIn ethnomusicological and popular music studies, scholarly accounts of cultural appropriation enacted by musicians have largely focused on white/black and settler/indigenous power imbalances. In this article, I turn to performances of intra-racial appropriation by Canadian rapper Drake. I argue that my conceptualization of "embodied Caribbeanization" provides a necessary framework to interrogate the distinct processes, mechanisms, methodologies, and negotiations by which Drake accesses Caribbeanness as a resource to perform his Torontonian diasporic subjectivity or "6ixhood," albeit often at the cost of exploiting and rendering invisible salient embodied knowledges located within the archive of Caribbean music, dance, language, and vocality. Dans les études en ethnomusicologie et en musique populaire, lorsque les chercheurs mentionnent des appropriations culturelles par des musiciens, ils se concentrent en général sur les déséquilibres de pouvoir entre blancs et noirs, ou entre colons et autochtones. Dans cet article, je me penche sur des performances d'appropriation intra-raciales par le rappeur canadien Drake. J'avance que mon concept « d'incarnation de la caribéisation » procure un cadre nécessaire pour interroger les processus, les mécanismes, les méthodologies et les négociations au travers desquels Drake accède à une « caribéanité » qui lui sert de ressource pour interpréter sa subjectivité diasporique d'habitant de Toronto, celle du « 6ix », quoique cela se fasse souvent au prix d'une exploitation, et d'un renvoi à l'invisibilité, des savoirs incarnés essentiels situés au coeur des archives de la musique, de la danse, de la langue et de la vocalité caribéenne.Download Free PDFView PDFFarewell, Farewell: Carnival, Performance and Exhibition in the Circum-Atlantic Economy of the FleshClaire  TanconsAn essay in the companion book to the exhibition EN MAS: Carnival and Performance Art of the Caribbean, Farewell, Farewell: Carnival, Performance and Exhibition in the Circum-Atlantic Economy of the Flesh, bids farewell to traditional definitions and representations of Carnival in the Americas in general, and the Caribbean in particular, predicated upon the etymology of Farewell to the Flesh (Carne Levare). Instead, the essay reinsert flesh at the center of the debate about this unique circum-atlantic performance that is Carnival. The first section elicits a modern theory of Carnival in the Americas by introducing a novel etymythology of Carnival as Chariot of the Sea (Carrus Navalis). It asks: "What became of Carnival during the crossing of the Middle Passage and following the experience of slavery and colonization in the Americas?". A second section follows closely the eponymous exhibition I curated for Contemporary Arts Center New Orleans by Circumambulating the 2014 Caribbean Carnival season during which myself and collaborator Krista Thompson commissioned performances to 9 artists in 7 different Caribbean cities: Nicolás Dumit Estévez at Santiago de los Treinta Caballeros (Dominican Republic); Christophe Chassol around Fort-de-France (Martinique) ; Marlon Griffith in Port of Spain (Trinidad and Tobago); Charles Campbell and Ebony Patterson in Kingston (Jamaica); Cauleen Smith in New Orleans; Lorraine O'Grady in New York (USA); Hew Locke in London (UK); John Beadle in Nassau (The Bahamas). Through close descriptions and evocations, I show how the various strategies deployed by the artists circumvent carnival altogether. In a third and final section I call for a reinsertion of Carnival within the counter-history of the birth of the museum and begin to suggest ways to expand upon the exhibitionary complex through various curatorial strategies.Download Free PDFView PDFCaribbean Creatives July-Sept. 2013 pp. 18-20Festival Economics in the Caribbean: Challenges and Prospects Jo-anne TullDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
