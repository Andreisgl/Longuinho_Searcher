She curses too much, drinks exactly the right amount of red wine, and sleeps way too little. She's also lucky enough to live in Central Texas with her wife and three dogs, where the astonishing diversity of humans and landscapes and tattoo shops serve as her muse.LINKS*Amazon Affiliatehttps://www.authorkellyfox.com/Kelly Fox | Amazon https://amzn.to/3aCYY6y BOOKS by KELLY FOXScout and the Lavender Girl — writing as K.C.
