GEOTHERMAL ENERGY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN NORTH WEST INDIAN HIMALAYAS by Ritesh Aryaby RITESH ARYA and Midttømme, KirstiIndian Science News Agency ,  May 2013Development of the geothermal resources has the potential to supply the region with electric powe... more Development of the geothermal resources has the potential to supply the region with electric power, heat and cold which will increase industrial efficiency and productivity in sectors such as agriculture, food processing, tourism and mining. Still this resource in India is ignored and presently used for bathing and cooking only. An Indian­Norwegian Programme for Research Cooperation (INDNOR) has been established to promote collaboration on research and research funding between India and Norway. Present paper highlights the findings of the pre project Agneyodgara (Indor) 2011­ 12 "Sustainable Development of Geothermal Energy in NW Indian Himalayas" funded through INDNOR Programme. Geothermal experts from India, Norway and Iceland participate in areas for long­term research cooperation includes exploration and development of geothermal resources, geothermal plant technology, water quality, impact on the society and the environment and capacity building.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Climate change natural - Impact on water resources in Himalaya by Ritesh aryaPresent paper is based on discovery of paleoclimatic signatures made by Indus glacier/river on th... more Present paper is based on discovery of paleoclimatic signatures made by Indus glacier/river on the granites of Ladakh batholiths on the banks of river Indus since 11714 years.  Author discovered these signatures while exploring, drilling and developing groundwater on the borders of China(Changthang)  and Pakistan( Siachen, Kargil) in NW Indian Himalaya for Army and civil population for the last 12 years. These signatures resembles alphabet C, hence named Aryas C cycles. Cyclicity of cooling, warming and again cooling can be very well understood by writing alphabet C. The starting point of alphabet C represents the cooling phase (ICE age) and as we continue to draw the curve there is gradual curvilinear transformation from cooling maxima to warming phase. Half of the C curve represents the warming maxima (an event marked by flooding, cyclones, sea level rise, desertification, biodiversity explosion, increase in GHGs) and completion of alphabet C represents the culmination of the gradual curvilinear transformation from warming to cooling coinciding with ICE age (marked by squeezing and freezing of water resources, glaciations, desertification, competition, mass extinctions, decrease in GHGs). Transferring this sentence geologically means that since there is less water in the system during ICE age so there is less erosion hence we get starting and end of C cycle but as the temperature increases the rate of erosion increases hence the curvilinear depressions are created making the upper half of the warming cycling, center of alphabet C is marked by warming maxima. Then there is again gradual transformation from warming to cooling and as the water in the system decreases there is less erosion therefore we get a geomorphological feature which resembles the lower half of alphabet C finally ending into the ICE age.  So uniformity in the paleoclimatic signatures discovered in Ladakh Himalaya which resembles alphabet C , for the first time geologically and scientifically explains cooling, warming and again cooling phase in nature to be a natural climate cyclic process. Granites played important role in the preservation of these climatic signatures because they are very hard and compact as compared to other rocks found in the Himalayas which are fragile and susceptible to faster rate of weathering and erosion making preservation of the signatures tedious task. Taphonomical analysis of these C curves in massive Granites show great role of lithology and geomorphology in preservation and understanding the cyclicity of these climate signatures which have been beautifully preserved in the Ladakh Batholith in NW Himalaya.  Author observed 10 such cycles in the site,8 complete and 2 half cycle. Geomathematical modeling of these paleoclimatic signatures show that after every 4 cycles there is a half cycle. According to this model each complete C cycle is of 1338.6 years and half C cycle is 669.3 years. Based on this model author has tried to correlate the paleo climatic and geological events in the past and found that lot of events can be explained by Aryas C cycles.  Important question now is which part of the C cycle are we now. Seeing the paleoclimatic signature in the Batholiths of Ladakh we are presently in the warming maxima times and are curvilinearly moving into the cooling phase finally culminating into ICE age in 2344 years, represented by the lower part of alphabet C. So enjoy global warming by building sustainable habitats in geologically favorable locations because the next warming maxima will be in 3014. Author also tries to relate circumstantial evidences with the dates of warming and cooling proposed in this model which coincides with the same.

Fossils from Kasauli and Nyoma:: Paleolatitudinal significance and their role in understanding the timings of Indo – China collision? Ritesh Arya“National Conference on Paleogene of the Indian Subcontinent”  April 23-24, 2015, at Lucknow organised by Geological Survey of India, Lucknow and Birbal Sahni Institute of Paleobotany, Lucknow.,  Apr 23, 2015
Interesting fossils found in Kasauli during late 1990’s  belonging to Garcinia, Gluta, Syzygium... more Interesting fossils found in Kasauli during late 1990’s  belonging to Garcinia, Gluta, Syzygium, Clinogene, Combretum and palms from Kasauli Formation and presented by the author  in Symosium organised GSI by 1994  had shown beyond doubt the similarity with the extant taxa from coastal regions of Indo-Malayan including Borneo and Sumatra and Andaman Nicobar Islands which indicate well hot humid equatorial climatic conditions of deposition with major representation of evergreen elements typical of near equatorial conditions and near shore coastal marine influence on otherwise terrestrial environment prevailed during those times. Fossils of mega plants all along the Indo Malayan Indonesian islands establish land connections for their migration during those times. This fact on environmental regime(near coastal / marine transgression) at the time of deposition is further supported by fossil and sedimentological findings in Kasauli, Dharamsala, Udhampur, Jammu, Kalakot, Kargil, Alchi., Stok , Kangri range and Nyoma in the northwestern Indian Himalayas  and further in Chitarwata Formation, west central Pakistan; and  the equivalent formation in Darjeeling ,West Bengal, North Eastern India and Bhutan In North eastern sector all shallow marine coastal regimes. All these localities marked on the map show an interesting structural pattern revealing a lot about the history of their genesis in geological time. Interestingly on ground all the fossil plant assemblage localities show great similarity in lithologies, fossils and type of preservations with each other. The most important being the taphonomic relationship between the fossil wood and the sandstone facies which is quiet homogenous with other homotaxial localities or basins described above and show unmatched similarity in the environments of the deposition specially in the basins of Kasauli-Dagsahi, Dharamsala, Murree and Indus in LadakhBased on the fossil findings of Mitrgyana from the Kasauli sediments by the author elevation was also found to be less then 1300m in contrast to the present height of about 2000meters.This really meant that the Himalayas attained sufficient height to block the rain laden winds and thus the concept of monsoons was born. Presence of diverse assemblage of fossil flowers shows that seasonal changes had initiated during those times. Recent findings of Turetella,Venericardia Glyptoactys  Venericardia Cordiopsis and 100s of yet to be identified fossil specimen in authors collection from Nyoma in Ladakh along with oysters show close resemble from the fossils findings from Subathu Formation which confirms beyond doubt that  Subathu basin  extended uptil Nyoma and  enjoyed equatorial position during Lower Eocene times.  Since fossils from Kasauli show similar affinities with extant taxa of Indo Malayan region it can be very well be interpreted that Kasauli Formation and its equivalent also enjoyed near coastal equatorial to subequatorial climatic conditions and latitudes may be around 5-10 degrees north of equator at the time of deposition in contrast to 32 degrees which the place is presently located. This implies that the major tectonic forces which were to give rise to the future Himalayas were not very active during those times. Northward dragging of the uplifted Tethyan basin(during Dagsahi Times)  along with the Indian subcontinent took place much later then18.2 million years (Based on the findings of Stephenochara ungri) .   If this theory is to be believed than the rate of northward drifting can be calculated and actual timing of collision and upliftment of Himalayas be known.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Groundwater exploration and its exploitation in Ladakh Indian Himalayas: Implications for sustainable water development - Ritesh AryaCommands Work Engineers C/0 56 APO Srinagar,  Oct 2004Present paper is based on extensive research carried in the high altitude, cold, mountain, desert... more Present paper is based on extensive research carried in the high altitude, cold, mountain, deserts of Ladakh to find solutions to solve the water problem on sustainable basis. Prior to this study, the region with extreme temperate climatic conditions was considered to be devoid of groundwater resources. Entire system of water planning, its distribution and management was based on tapping/ pumping of surface water resource only and that too from shallow wells dug on the banks of streams / Indus River. This system is susceptible to various seasonal fluctuations i.e. flooding and silting of water in summers and freezing of source and water in the pipes in winters. Water is also distributed by water tankers to meet the ever increasing demand of drinking water, the region. In these conditions of uncertainty the water system remained unsustainable and uneconomical. Main aim of this paper is to advocate maximum utilization of groundwater resources and decentralization of water supply schemes in order to find sustainable water solutions to solve the drinking and agricultural water problem in the region.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
“Hill stations near Chandigarh are geologically upside down hence prone to seismic activity”  Ritesh Arya Himachal this week“Hill stations near Chandigarh are geologically upside down hence prone to seismic activity”     ... more “Hill stations near Chandigarh are geologically upside down hence prone to seismic activity”      Dr Ritesh Arya.  CHANDIGARH—Earthquakes represent the Next tectonic event is expected in the Shivaliks along the path of the old Saraswati river and the present Ghaggar river, says Dr Ritesh Arya,Guinness world Record Holders and  an international famed Geologist of Chandigarh. He said that the foothill areas like Parwanoo, Pinjore and Panchkula fell into this zone. He feels that earthquake in Nepal is a warning to the authorities and private institutions bent on constructing cities with high-rise buildings and big industrial areas in North India especially if we are talking about Shimla, Solan, Parwanoo and Surajpur axis located near Chandigarh.                              Dr Arya while talking to this reporter said that today these towns are located in zones which were geologically upside down by this he  meant that older rocks were resting on the younger rocks as a result of which the entire sequence was geologically very fragile and susceptible to greater damage in the event of epicenter being concentrated upon these zones or these towns.                             Surajpur region is located on the Surajpur Thrust where Tehtyan Himalayan Limestone sequence is resting over the younger Shiwalik formation. In Parwanoo the Lower Shiwalik Formation (15 million years old) comprising of sandstone and shale representing fresh water terrestrial  environment is overlain by Subathu Limestone and black carboniferous (age approx 55 million years old) representing marine environment at the time deposition.“This gap in the depositional history is the matter of concern and is also the cause of concentration of seismic activity in the region,” warns Dr Arya. He has done geological fieldwork around Surajpur-Shimla Highway and found that this section was very well exposed in the Parwanoo sector 4 Area where an experimental well was drilled few years back to monitor the earthquake but  there was few practical problems and the instrument started recording the movement of the trucks and heavy vehilcles and the project was prematurely abandoned                               Dwelling on his study, he said that in Barog or Solan, the Subathu formation which was 55 Million years old was being overlain or thrusted by Krol Formation which was more than 400 Million years old. Similarly in Shimla town, the metamorphosed Shilma Slates are overlying the younger sedimentary tertiary sequence of Subathu, says he.                             “The Indian subcontinent has had its share of earthquakes. From mild, to moderate and to devastating ones, Earthquakes happen every year in India. One of the reasons why this happens is because there is a tectonic shift of the Indian plate at a rate of forty seven millimeters a year towards Chinese plate. Geologically, the region is highly folded and faulted due to northward tectonic movement of Indian Plate which dragged for millions of years to finally collide with Chinese plate,” said Dr Arya.                             Initially these towns were designed for a small population but today these have become crowded epicenters with tourism, educational institutes and industries coupled with high-rise buildings flocking these towns. All this has resulted upcoming of Baddi-Barotiwala-Nalagarh belt and haphazard construction of various institutional buildings in the absence of proper geotechnical institutions to control and design the buildings and certify or lay standards necessary for them to withstand the seismic activity the whole concept of sustainable development goes for a six. Need of the hour is to inspect the old buildings and make stringent laws for the new buildings so that in case of eventuality minimum damage is done.                               Today there is no institute dedicated to study and monitor or predict earthquakes inspite of the fact that earthquakes have the greatest impact and cause instant devastation on the crowded habitations. Dr Arya said that there was need of setting up of geotechnical institute and monitor data collected from the bore wells to seriously study and reinterpret data for predicting earthquakes and to understand the global warming phenomenon.  Need of the hour is to not to stop construction but take all the necessary precaution to nullify the impact of any seismic activity upto Richter scale 9.  He revealed that during the earthquake at Latur it was found a surge in the level of ground water several hours before the event occurred. It had been observed that the water level either increased or decreased sharply before a tremor hits an area. Besides, its chemical composition was also altered due to an increase in Radon gases because of excessive of radioactivity before and after the event.                              These along with the natural springs and geysers (hot springs) like the ones at Manikaran and Tattapani are important precursors of geothermic activity which precedes an earthquake.                                                         From 1819 to1950, the country had experienced five earthquakes of 8 or more magnitude at Richter Scales. On June 16, 1819, an earthquake of 8 magnitude at Richter Scales was occurred in Kutch (Gujarat); June 12, 1897 of 8.7 magnitude in Shillong; in 1905 of 8 magnitude in Kangra (Himachal Pradesh); January 15, 1934 of 8.3 magnitude on Bihar-Nepal Border; August, 1950 of 8.5 magnitude in Arunachal Pradesh. Since 1950, country had experienced earthquake of less than 6.5 magnitude at Richter Scales.  EOMSave to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Natural  lake created by landslide on river Zanskar at Phuktal J&K:: Opportunites  for hdyropower and tourism development - by Ritesh Arya Introduction : Formation of Natural Lake in Zanskar due to landslide blocking the Phutkal  river ... more Introduction : Formation of Natural Lake in Zanskar due to landslide blocking the Phutkal  river at  33°17'51.38"N and 77°16'59.82"E  at an elevation of 12902 feet  leading to  forming a 16km lake on 31st December 2014 is a natural phenomenon and there is nothing artificial about it. Present report is an effort to see an opportunity to use this blockade as a means to check the silting and flooding problem by strengthening this natural blockade and creating a dam. If the situation permits the dam can be converted into hydel power project and energy produced on small scale to supply it to Phutkal Gompa and neighboring villages which have been deprived of this basic necessity till date. The slide is approximately 185.6kms from the Confluence of Zanskar river and Indus River at  Nimmu.

Love Passion and Dinosaur Extinction - Ritesh AryaThe present paper is based on observations made by the author during hydrogeological investigatio... more The present paper is based on observations made by the author during hydrogeological investigations done at Tiger Male, an observation post in Changthang area about 200 miles from Leh..  It is located in the high altitude, cold mountain deserts of Ladakh Himalayas. The aim of this project was to provide sustainable drinking water to the troops stationed on the Indo-Tibetan (China) Border by developing groundwater resources from a borehole, drilled with the help of suitable rig mounted on a truck.   However, unusual observations made by the author regarding the geology of the region and the abnormal behaviour of the animal (lizards) during the drilling/welding operations caught on a video, made him think otherwise. In the present paper the author has tried to correlate these annotations to propose a new theory for the selective extinction of Dinosaurs on one hand and on the other hand have tried to explain the taphonomic processes involved in their preservation in those uncertain geological conditions prevalent during the K/T times.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The sites from where fossils have been collected for the present paper lie in Kasauli, Dharamsala, Udhampur, Jammu, Kalakot Kargil,Alchi. Stok Kangri range and Nyoma in the northwestern Indian Himalayas³. All these localities marked on the map and show an interesting structural pattern revealing a lot about the history of their genesis in geological time. Interestingly on ground all the fossil plant assemblage localities show great similarity in lithologies, fossils and type of preservations with each other. The most important being the taphonomic relationship between the fossil wood and the sandstone facies which is quiet homogenous with other homotaxial localities or basins described above and show unmatched similarity in the environments of the deposition specially in the basins of Kasauli-Dagsahi, Dharamsala, Murree² and Indus in Ladakh³ Interesting observations made in the papers published earlier are reinterpreted based on the recent observations and fossil findings made by the author from different localities along the Indus River in the high altitude, cold temperate climatic conditions of Ladakh to decipher the age, environment, paleo latitudinal position, geographic, phytogeographic distribution and various processes involved in evolution, proliferation and diversification of biotic(angiosperms and mammals) and abiotic (climatologically and geological ) events in those times ¹ ³. Preliminary studies show that there was close similarity of the fossils of Garcinia, Gluta, Syzygium, Clinogene, Combretum and palms reported from Kasauli Formation 4 with the extant taxa from coastal regions of Indo-Malayan including Borneo and Sumatra which indicate well established land connections for their migration during those times. Hot humid and tropical conditions of deposition with major representation of evergreen elements typical of near equatorial conditions and near shore coastal marine influence on otherwise terrestrial environment prevailed during those times 4. This fact on environmental regime at the time of deposition is further supported in Chitarwata Formation, west central Pakistan 5,6; Ladakh, North India 7,8 Jammu, North India 9,10 Dharamsala, Northwestern India 2,11,12,13,14,; Kasauli, Northwest India 2,10,12, Darjeeling ,West Bengal, North Eastern India and Bhutan15,16. Based on the fossil findings of Mitrgyana from the Kasauli sediments elevation was also found to be less then 1300m in contrast to the present height of about 2000meters 17. This really meant that the Himalayas attained sufficient height to block the rain laden winds and thus the concept of monsoons was born. Presence of diverse assemblage of fossil flowers shows that seasonal changes had initiated during those times18. However more data is still required to rebuild the paleogeographic map based on these interpretation.It is very well documented fact that Subathu Formation enjoyed equatorial position during Lower Eocene times and from the above findings it can be interpreted that Kasauli Formation and its equivalent also enjoyed near coastal equatorial to tropical climatic conditions and latitudes may be around 10-20 degrees north of equator at the time of deposition in contrast to 32 degrees. References 1. Arya R., Workshop on Himalayan Foreland basin Organised by Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology, 1998, pp 12-142 Srivastava,V.K. and Cashyap,S.M. , Geol.Soc., 1983,24(3), 134-147 3.Arya R., Seminar on contributions to Himalayan geology, Organised by Wadia Institute of Himalayan geology 2001 4.Arya,R and Awasthi,N Proc.Symp.

Borewell samples analysed from the wells drilled clearly show that global warming and cooling processes are like day and night. They are essential part of the global climate natural cycle which act in uniform to continuously change the various landforms on this mother earth and make it geomorphologicaly so beautiful.       Holding man and his activities responsible for pollution is acceptable truth but holding him responsible for global warming is an Inconvenient Truth, because man is too small to cause any changes of global scale on sustainable basis.This Paper emphasise the use of proper technology to improve production and decrease pollution on one hand and recommends use of renewable energy resources so that pure air can be made available to all. It also emphasises the need to re-examine the global warming definition as proposed by IPCC which holds man and his activities for increased global warming in recent years. Experiments carried by the author while drilling wells in the Indus Basin clearly show that major glaciers including the Indus Glacier which extended from Mansarovar in Tibet  to Arabian sea melted much before the advent of Industrialisation and rates of receding of glaciers though unknown were much faster then are being projected and related to the activities of man.Global warming has to be viewed in a different perspective where it is related to the influx of increased water in the natural system so that sediments deposited during global cooling times can be transported to rivers and oceans. Act in a similar way as the scavengers cleaning the earth and transporting them in the oceans. Cyclones, tsunamis, Flash floods, sea level rise, land submergence and glacial retreat are prominent and natural agencies responsible for the various processes of the global warming and  helping her to transport the deposited material into the rivers/oceans. In this context man with his modern excavating machinery can also be called one of his agencies because he is also digging and at times transporting the deposits.   Time has come to put things about global warming, straight, before it is too late.Associating global warming to activities of man as proposed by IPCC, contributing to increased green house gases, leading to enhanced temperatures, or faster melting rates of glaciers will only make things worse because the definition does not explain the process in totality.With little precaution while selecting the site for habitation near the coasts or glacio-fluvial valleys impacts of global warming like cyclones, flash flooding, land submergence etc can be minimised. Today technicians (chemists, physics, biologists, and radiologist) have become doctors of mother earth, whereas geologists who are real doctors of mother earth are less listened to by the politicians for reasons best known to them.Imagine living in Antarctica or Greenland for the rest of the life without water, without cyclones, without floods. It will lead to out extinction.So it’s high time, we learn to ”Enjoy global warming” otherwise what are we going to do in global cooling timesSave to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Climate change natural - Impact on water resources in Himalaya by Ritesh aryaPresent paper is based on discovery of paleoclimatic signatures made by Indus glacier/river on th... more Present paper is based on discovery of paleoclimatic signatures made by Indus glacier/river on the granites of Ladakh batholiths on the banks of river Indus since 11714 years.  Author discovered these signatures while exploring, drilling and developing groundwater on the borders of China(Changthang)  and Pakistan( Siachen, Kargil) in NW Indian Himalaya for Army and civil population for the last 12 years. These signatures resembles alphabet C, hence named Aryas C cycles. Cyclicity of cooling, warming and again cooling can be very well understood by writing alphabet C. The starting point of alphabet C represents the cooling phase (ICE age) and as we continue to draw the curve there is gradual curvilinear transformation from cooling maxima to warming phase. Half of the C curve represents the warming maxima (an event marked by flooding, cyclones, sea level rise, desertification, biodiversity explosion, increase in GHGs) and completion of alphabet C represents the culmination of the gradual curvilinear transformation from warming to cooling coinciding with ICE age (marked by squeezing and freezing of water resources, glaciations, desertification, competition, mass extinctions, decrease in GHGs). Transferring this sentence geologically means that since there is less water in the system during ICE age so there is less erosion hence we get starting and end of C cycle but as the temperature increases the rate of erosion increases hence the curvilinear depressions are created making the upper half of the warming cycling, center of alphabet C is marked by warming maxima. Then there is again gradual transformation from warming to cooling and as the water in the system decreases there is less erosion therefore we get a geomorphological feature which resembles the lower half of alphabet C finally ending into the ICE age.  So uniformity in the paleoclimatic signatures discovered in Ladakh Himalaya which resembles alphabet C , for the first time geologically and scientifically explains cooling, warming and again cooling phase in nature to be a natural climate cyclic process. Granites played important role in the preservation of these climatic signatures because they are very hard and compact as compared to other rocks found in the Himalayas which are fragile and susceptible to faster rate of weathering and erosion making preservation of the signatures tedious task. Taphonomical analysis of these C curves in massive Granites show great role of lithology and geomorphology in preservation and understanding the cyclicity of these climate signatures which have been beautifully preserved in the Ladakh Batholith in NW Himalaya.  Author observed 10 such cycles in the site,8 complete and 2 half cycle. Geomathematical modeling of these paleoclimatic signatures show that after every 4 cycles there is a half cycle. According to this model each complete C cycle is of 1338.6 years and half C cycle is 669.3 years. Based on this model author has tried to correlate the paleo climatic and geological events in the past and found that lot of events can be explained by Aryas C cycles.  Important question now is which part of the C cycle are we now. Seeing the paleoclimatic signature in the Batholiths of Ladakh we are presently in the warming maxima times and are curvilinearly moving into the cooling phase finally culminating into ICE age in 2344 years, represented by the lower part of alphabet C. So enjoy global warming by building sustainable habitats in geologically favorable locations because the next warming maxima will be in 3014. Author also tries to relate circumstantial evidences with the dates of warming and cooling proposed in this model which coincides with the same.

Fossils from Kasauli and Nyoma:: Paleolatitudinal significance and their role in understanding the timings of Indo – China collision?

Interesting fossils found in Kasauli during late 1990’s  belonging to Garcinia, Gluta, Syzygium... more Interesting fossils found in Kasauli during late 1990’s  belonging to Garcinia, Gluta, Syzygium, Clinogene, Combretum and palms from Kasauli Formation and presented by the author  in Symosium organised GSI by 1994  had shown beyond doubt the similarity with the extant taxa from coastal regions of Indo-Malayan including Borneo and Sumatra and Andaman Nicobar Islands which indicate well hot humid equatorial climatic conditions of deposition with major representation of evergreen elements typical of near equatorial conditions and near shore coastal marine influence on otherwise terrestrial environment prevailed during those times. Fossils of mega plants all along the Indo Malayan Indonesian islands establish land connections for their migration during those times. This fact on environmental regime(near coastal / marine transgression) at the time of deposition is further supported by fossil and sedimentological findings in Kasauli, Dharamsala, Udhampur, Jammu, Kalakot, Kargil, Alchi., Stok , Kangri range and Nyoma in the northwestern Indian Himalayas  and further in Chitarwata Formation, west central Pakistan; and  the equivalent formation in Darjeeling ,West Bengal, North Eastern India and Bhutan In North eastern sector all shallow marine coastal regimes. All these localities marked on the map show an interesting structural pattern revealing a lot about the history of their genesis in geological time. Interestingly on ground all the fossil plant assemblage localities show great similarity in lithologies, fossils and type of preservations with each other. The most important being the taphonomic relationship between the fossil wood and the sandstone facies which is quiet homogenous with other homotaxial localities or basins described above and show unmatched similarity in the environments of the deposition specially in the basins of Kasauli-Dagsahi, Dharamsala, Murree and Indus in LadakhBased on the fossil findings of Mitrgyana from the Kasauli sediments by the author elevation was also found to be less then 1300m in contrast to the present height of about 2000meters.This really meant that the Himalayas attained sufficient height to block the rain laden winds and thus the concept of monsoons was born. Presence of diverse assemblage of fossil flowers shows that seasonal changes had initiated during those times. Recent findings of Turetella,Venericardia Glyptoactys  Venericardia Cordiopsis and 100s of yet to be identified fossil specimen in authors collection from Nyoma in Ladakh along with oysters show close resemble from the fossils findings from Subathu Formation which confirms beyond doubt that  Subathu basin  extended uptil Nyoma and  enjoyed equatorial position during Lower Eocene times.  Since fossils from Kasauli show similar affinities with extant taxa of Indo Malayan region it can be very well be interpreted that Kasauli Formation and its equivalent also enjoyed near coastal equatorial to subequatorial climatic conditions and latitudes may be around 5-10 degrees north of equator at the time of deposition in contrast to 32 degrees which the place is presently located. This implies that the major tectonic forces which were to give rise to the future Himalayas were not very active during those times. Northward dragging of the uplifted Tethyan basin(during Dagsahi Times)  along with the Indian subcontinent took place much later then18.2 million years (Based on the findings of Stephenochara ungri) .   If this theory is to be believed than the rate of northward drifting can be calculated and actual timing of collision and upliftment of Himalayas be known.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Groundwater exploration and its exploitation in Ladakh Indian Himalayas: Implications for sustainable water development - Ritesh AryaCommands Work Engineers C/0 56 APO Srinagar,  Oct 2004Present paper is based on extensive research carried in the high altitude, cold, mountain, desert... more Present paper is based on extensive research carried in the high altitude, cold, mountain, deserts of Ladakh to find solutions to solve the water problem on sustainable basis. Prior to this study, the region with extreme temperate climatic conditions was considered to be devoid of groundwater resources. Entire system of water planning, its distribution and management was based on tapping/ pumping of surface water resource only and that too from shallow wells dug on the banks of streams / Indus River. This system is susceptible to various seasonal fluctuations i.e. flooding and silting of water in summers and freezing of source and water in the pipes in winters. Water is also distributed by water tankers to meet the ever increasing demand of drinking water, the region. In these conditions of uncertainty the water system remained unsustainable and uneconomical. Main aim of this paper is to advocate maximum utilization of groundwater resources and decentralization of water supply schemes in order to find sustainable water solutions to solve the drinking and agricultural water problem in the region.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
“Hill stations near Chandigarh are geologically upside down hence prone to seismic activity”  Ritesh Arya Himachal this week“Hill stations near Chandigarh are geologically upside down hence prone to seismic activity”     ... more “Hill stations near Chandigarh are geologically upside down hence prone to seismic activity”      Dr Ritesh Arya.  CHANDIGARH—Earthquakes represent the Next tectonic event is expected in the Shivaliks along the path of the old Saraswati river and the present Ghaggar river, says Dr Ritesh Arya,Guinness world Record Holders and  an international famed Geologist of Chandigarh. He said that the foothill areas like Parwanoo, Pinjore and Panchkula fell into this zone. He feels that earthquake in Nepal is a warning to the authorities and private institutions bent on constructing cities with high-rise buildings and big industrial areas in North India especially if we are talking about Shimla, Solan, Parwanoo and Surajpur axis located near Chandigarh.                              Dr Arya while talking to this reporter said that today these towns are located in zones which were geologically upside down by this he  meant that older rocks were resting on the younger rocks as a result of which the entire sequence was geologically very fragile and susceptible to greater damage in the event of epicenter being concentrated upon these zones or these towns.                             Surajpur region is located on the Surajpur Thrust where Tehtyan Himalayan Limestone sequence is resting over the younger Shiwalik formation. In Parwanoo the Lower Shiwalik Formation (15 million years old) comprising of sandstone and shale representing fresh water terrestrial  environment is overlain by Subathu Limestone and black carboniferous (age approx 55 million years old) representing marine environment at the time deposition.“This gap in the depositional history is the matter of concern and is also the cause of concentration of seismic activity in the region,” warns Dr Arya. He has done geological fieldwork around Surajpur-Shimla Highway and found that this section was very well exposed in the Parwanoo sector 4 Area where an experimental well was drilled few years back to monitor the earthquake but  there was few practical problems and the instrument started recording the movement of the trucks and heavy vehilcles and the project was prematurely abandoned                               Dwelling on his study, he said that in Barog or Solan, the Subathu formation which was 55 Million years old was being overlain or thrusted by Krol Formation which was more than 400 Million years old. Similarly in Shimla town, the metamorphosed Shilma Slates are overlying the younger sedimentary tertiary sequence of Subathu, says he.                             “The Indian subcontinent has had its share of earthquakes. From mild, to moderate and to devastating ones, Earthquakes happen every year in India. One of the reasons why this happens is because there is a tectonic shift of the Indian plate at a rate of forty seven millimeters a year towards Chinese plate. Geologically, the region is highly folded and faulted due to northward tectonic movement of Indian Plate which dragged for millions of years to finally collide with Chinese plate,” said Dr Arya.                             Initially these towns were designed for a small population but today these have become crowded epicenters with tourism, educational institutes and industries coupled with high-rise buildings flocking these towns. All this has resulted upcoming of Baddi-Barotiwala-Nalagarh belt and haphazard construction of various institutional buildings in the absence of proper geotechnical institutions to control and design the buildings and certify or lay standards necessary for them to withstand the seismic activity the whole concept of sustainable development goes for a six. Need of the hour is to inspect the old buildings and make stringent laws for the new buildings so that in case of eventuality minimum damage is done.                               Today there is no institute dedicated to study and monitor or predict earthquakes inspite of the fact that earthquakes have the greatest impact and cause instant devastation on the crowded habitations. Dr Arya said that there was need of setting up of geotechnical institute and monitor data collected from the bore wells to seriously study and reinterpret data for predicting earthquakes and to understand the global warming phenomenon.  Need of the hour is to not to stop construction but take all the necessary precaution to nullify the impact of any seismic activity upto Richter scale 9.  He revealed that during the earthquake at Latur it was found a surge in the level of ground water several hours before the event occurred. It had been observed that the water level either increased or decreased sharply before a tremor hits an area. Besides, its chemical composition was also altered due to an increase in Radon gases because of excessive of radioactivity before and after the event.                              These along with the natural springs and geysers (hot springs) like the ones at Manikaran and Tattapani are important precursors of geothermic activity which precedes an earthquake.                                                         From 1819 to1950, the country had experienced five earthquakes of 8 or more magnitude at Richter Scales. On June 16, 1819, an earthquake of 8 magnitude at Richter Scales was occurred in Kutch (Gujarat); June 12, 1897 of 8.7 magnitude in Shillong; in 1905 of 8 magnitude in Kangra (Himachal Pradesh); January 15, 1934 of 8.3 magnitude on Bihar-Nepal Border; August, 1950 of 8.5 magnitude in Arunachal Pradesh. Since 1950, country had experienced earthquake of less than 6.5 magnitude at Richter Scales.  EOMSave to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Natural  lake created by landslide on river Zanskar at Phuktal J&K:: Opportunites  for hdyropower and tourism development - by Ritesh Arya Introduction : Formation of Natural Lake in Zanskar due to landslide blocking the Phutkal  river ... more Introduction : Formation of Natural Lake in Zanskar due to landslide blocking the Phutkal  river at  33°17'51.38"N and 77°16'59.82"E  at an elevation of 12902 feet  leading to  forming a 16km lake on 31st December 2014 is a natural phenomenon and there is nothing artificial about it. Present report is an effort to see an opportunity to use this blockade as a means to check the silting and flooding problem by strengthening this natural blockade and creating a dam. If the situation permits the dam can be converted into hydel power project and energy produced on small scale to supply it to Phutkal Gompa and neighboring villages which have been deprived of this basic necessity till date.

Love Passion and Dinosaur Extinction - Ritesh AryaThe present paper is based on observations made by the author during hydrogeological investigatio... more The present paper is based on observations made by the author during hydrogeological investigations done at Tiger Male, an observation post in Changthang area about 200 miles from Leh..  It is located in the high altitude, cold mountain deserts of Ladakh Himalayas. The aim of this project was to provide sustainable drinking water to the troops stationed on the Indo-Tibetan (China) Border by developing groundwater resources from a borehole, drilled with the help of suitable rig mounted on a truck.   However, unusual observations made by the author regarding the geology of the region and the abnormal behaviour of the animal (lizards) during the drilling/welding operations caught on a video, made him think otherwise. In the present paper the author has tried to correlate these annotations to propose a new theory for the selective extinction of Dinosaurs on one hand and on the other hand have tried to explain the taphonomic processes involved in their preservation in those uncertain geological conditions prevalent during the K/T times.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The sites from where fossils have been collected for the present paper lie in Kasauli, Dharamsala, Udhampur, Jammu, Kalakot Kargil,Alchi. Stok Kangri range and Nyoma in the northwestern Indian Himalayas³. All these localities marked on the map and show an interesting structural pattern revealing a lot about the history of their genesis in geological time. Interestingly on ground all the fossil plant assemblage localities show great similarity in lithologies, fossils and type of preservations with each other. The most important being the taphonomic relationship between the fossil wood and the sandstone facies which is quiet homogenous with other homotaxial localities or basins described above and show unmatched similarity in the environments of the deposition specially in the basins of Kasauli-Dagsahi, Dharamsala, Murree² and Indus in Ladakh³ Interesting observations made in the papers published earlier are reinterpreted based on the recent observations and fossil findings made by the author from different localities along the Indus River in the high altitude, cold temperate climatic conditions of Ladakh to decipher the age, environment, paleo latitudinal position, geographic, phytogeographic distribution and various processes involved in evolution, proliferation and diversification of biotic(angiosperms and mammals) and abiotic (climatologically and geological ) events in those times ¹ ³. Preliminary studies show that there was close similarity of the fossils of Garcinia, Gluta, Syzygium, Clinogene, Combretum and palms reported from Kasauli Formation 4 with the extant taxa from coastal regions of Indo-Malayan including Borneo and Sumatra which indicate well established land connections for their migration during those times. Hot humid and tropical conditions of deposition with major representation of evergreen elements typical of near equatorial conditions and near shore coastal marine influence on otherwise terrestrial environment prevailed during those times 4. This fact on environmental regime at the time of deposition is further supported in Chitarwata Formation, west central Pakistan 5,6; Ladakh, North India 7,8 Jammu, North India 9,10 Dharamsala, Northwestern India 2,11,12,13,14,; Kasauli, Northwest India 2,10,12, Darjeeling ,West Bengal, North Eastern India and Bhutan15,16. Based on the fossil findings of Mitrgyana from the Kasauli sediments elevation was also found to be less then 1300m in contrast to the present height of about 2000meters 17. This really meant that the Himalayas attained sufficient height to block the rain laden winds and thus the concept of monsoons was born. Presence of diverse assemblage of fossil flowers shows that seasonal changes had initiated during those times18. However more data is still required to rebuild the paleogeographic map based on these interpretation.It is very well documented fact that Subathu Formation enjoyed equatorial position during Lower Eocene times and from the above findings it can be interpreted that Kasauli Formation and its equivalent also enjoyed near coastal equatorial to tropical climatic conditions and latitudes may be around 10-20 degrees north of equator at the time of deposition in contrast to 32 degrees. References 1. Arya R., Workshop on Himalayan Foreland basin Organised by Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology, 1998, pp 12-142 Srivastava,V.K. and Cashyap,S.M. , Geol.Soc., 1983,24(3), 134-147 3.Arya R., Seminar on contributions to Himalayan geology, Organised by Wadia Institute of Himalayan geology 2001 4.Arya,R and Awasthi,N Proc.Symp.

Borewell samples analysed from the wells drilled clearly show that global warming and cooling processes are like day and night. They are essential part of the global climate natural cycle which act in uniform to continuously change the various landforms on this mother earth and make it geomorphologicaly so beautiful.       Holding man and his activities responsible for pollution is acceptable truth but holding him responsible for global warming is an Inconvenient Truth, because man is too small to cause any changes of global scale on sustainable basis.This Paper emphasise the use of proper technology to improve production and decrease pollution on one hand and recommends use of renewable energy resources so that pure air can be made available to all. It also emphasises the need to re-examine the global warming definition as proposed by IPCC which holds man and his activities for increased global warming in recent years. Experiments carried by the author while drilling wells in the Indus Basin clearly show that major glaciers including the Indus Glacier which extended from Mansarovar in Tibet  to Arabian sea melted much before the advent of Industrialisation and rates of receding of glaciers though unknown were much faster then are being projected and related to the activities of man.Global warming has to be viewed in a different perspective where it is related to the influx of increased water in the natural system so that sediments deposited during global cooling times can be transported to rivers and oceans. Act in a similar way as the scavengers cleaning the earth and transporting them in the oceans. Cyclones, tsunamis, Flash floods, sea level rise, land submergence and glacial retreat are prominent and natural agencies responsible for the various processes of the global warming and  helping her to transport the deposited material into the rivers/oceans. In this context man with his modern excavating machinery can also be called one of his agencies because he is also digging and at times transporting the deposits.   Time has come to put things about global warming, straight, before it is too late.Associating global warming to activities of man as proposed by IPCC, contributing to increased green house gases, leading to enhanced temperatures, or faster melting rates of glaciers will only make things worse because the definition does not explain the process in totality.With little precaution while selecting the site for habitation near the coasts or glacio-fluvial valleys impacts of global warming like cyclones, flash flooding, land submergence etc can be minimised. Today technicians (chemists, physics, biologists, and radiologist) have become doctors of mother earth, whereas geologists who are real doctors of mother earth are less listened to by the politicians for reasons best known to them.Imagine living in Antarctica or Greenland for the rest of the life without water, without cyclones, without floods. It will lead to out extinction.So it’s high time, we learn to ”Enjoy global warming” otherwise what are we going to do in global cooling timesSave to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Geological complexity, geographical inaccessibility, climatic extreme variability and unavailability of hydro geological data all combine to make groundwater, a mystery to understand and difficult to develop as a resource for policy makers and politicians. Present paper tries to bridge this gap by compiling the available data from the wells drilled and establishes the relationship between groundwater, glacier, floods and global warming in mountains so that groundwater could be understood and used in totality to solve the day to day water problem. On one hand paper laments that global warming is natural cyclic process and glacial melting will lead to increased water in the  natural mountain system which supports  increased evolution and diversification of life forms on other it advocates steps required to cope with floods induced due to glacial melt which pose  great threat to  habitants in mountain valleys.Present paper highlights the significance of groundwater exploration for sustainable water development in the Himalayas.Case StudyTo explain the relationship of groundwater,glaciers,global warming in Himalayas the title I am presenting a Case study of Khardungla catchment which houses the Khardungla glacier and  Leh town finally culminating at Indus riverBorelog samples  and Indus glacierBased on the observation of the bore log samples collected while drilling borewells to develop groundwater resources to provide drinking water for the army and civil population in the high altitude, cold, mountain deserts of Ladakh, Indian Himalayas which are geologically complex and geographically isolated for more then 6 months due to extreme cold climatic conditions.  The author was able to find evidences of Indus Glacier deposits in the borewell samples at depth varying from 70 feet below the ground to 130 feet below the ground.This glacier might have extended from Mansrovar in Tibet to Arabian sea  >2000 metres length in geological past before ice age.Indus Glacier : Source of groundwater                                                                                                                                                                   The presence of paleo Indus glaciated channels at these depths is the source of rich reservoir of groundwater resources for meeting the drinking water requirement for Leh town now and in near future.Khardungla Glaicer: Source of surface as well as groundwaterThe Khardungla glacier located at top of the Batholithic hill is the main source of water both surface and groundwater to the Leh town. This glacier  extended upto  Spituk in geological past. But today it has receded more then 18 kms) and is on the verge of extinction and is confined only to the peeks of Khardungla at 18000 feet above the mean sea level.Groundwater:   a household commodity Experiments carried by the author in the end of the 20th century laid the foundation for sustainable development of  groundwater resources in the recent past. The groundwater today has become a household commodity and everyone is enjoying the fruits of the resource which was considered to be nonexistent about a decade ago.Life of groundwater α glacial meltThe important question here is how long are these resources going to last. The global warming has already taken its toll and the Khardungla glacier has already receded considerably. It is a matter of time and the groundwater will last till the snow cover last in the Khardungla. No Glacier …..No WaterNo Glacier means  no water in Leh catchment All the streams and the spring sources would dry up or become seasonal.Global warming, glacial recede, glacial extinction and MANThis is the story of all the glacial mountain catchments the world over. All the major glaciers world over had already receded much before the advent of man or industrialisation. Today these  mountain glaciers are on the verge of extinction. The impact of man and his activities was negligible in those times but still the rates of receding of glaciers were very high.Indus glacial extinction:  a natural processThe Indus glacier (itself owe its extinction from the Indus basin to global warming which happens to be the natural cyclic process initiated since last ice age  and has nothing  to do with man or his activity or rather to any geological activity on sustainable basis. Impact of glacial melt in Himalayas: Groundwater increaseThe author after studying more then 1000 wells drilled in different hydrostratigraphic formation across the Himalayas clearly shows that global warming has resulted in melting of glaciers since time immemorial. Immediate impact of this activity is increased groundwater and their storage in the mountains. This will lead to increased moisture in the soil and thus pave way for ushering green revolution in the mountains specially the high altitude cold mountain deserts of Ladakh  Mountain flash flooding and destructionLong term impact would be their activity leading to flash flooding once the storage capacity of these hills exceeds the threshold .This activity will first lead to mountain bursting and cause flash floods which have the capacity to wash anything which comes in its way downstream within seconds. If cyclones and hurricanes are talked about and feared events in the coastal areas, Mountain flash flooding is an event to be watched in near future in mountains.Economic Compulsion and geologic ignoranceToday economic compulsions and geological ignorance is forcing the habitations to flourish along the valley regions which were considered to be geologically fragile few decades ago but negligence of the geological data will lead them to pay a heavy prise for their activity. A simple flood will lead to heavy loss of life and property in the mountain state.Groundwater solutions for sustainable development Though the glaciers are the main source of groundwater recharge in the mountains the other side of glacial melting (FLASH FLOODING) due to global warming is very dangerous event threatening the very existence of the communities residing in the hills or mountain valleys,  if proper precautions are not made while selecting the habitations. This subject and phenomenon is poorly understood   but holds the key for our very existence in the mountains in near future. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxAbout Dr AryaDr Ritesh Arya,specialises in groundwater exploration and development in Indian Himalayas  for  providing sustainable water solutions to people living in high altitude cold mountain deserts of Ladakh, which were considered to be devoid of it.

History of groundwater development in Himalayas.docxHistory of groundwater development in Himalayas – A review 
Dr Ritesh Arya Director Water and Ge... more History of groundwater development in Himalayas – A review Dr Ritesh Arya Director Water and Geothermal section,  International Sustainable Energy organisation, Geneva CEO ARYA DRILLERS History of groundwater in Himalayas can be dated to the advent of the human civilisations in the mountains when they flourished in and around the springs which were nothing but manifestation of groundwater. Later with passage of time kingdoms were made and forts were constructed on the top of the hills the major source of water in those forts was not springs but were shallow wells dug by man. These wells were not only perennial then but today also those sources are very well developed and water seeps to the top by capillary action and makes that part of the abandoned fort green. So those were the times when the hydrogeologists of the past were known as PANI wala babas /saints who would study the rocks and groundwater interaction and with 100%  accuracy would be able to locate their wells which would supply 24x7 water to the solders at the peaks.At that time the mountain hydrogeology was at its peak and the success rate almost 100 % based on the study carried by the author by visiting various forts in Himachal since 1993. Starting from Panj Singho Ka Kila in Barsar to Malon ka Kila where the famous war between Gorkhas and Britishers was fought leading to their defeat and formation of 1st Gorkha Regiment. The advent of Britishers  who brought in pumping machinery with them led to the untimely death of the Pani walal Babas and in 100 years the age old science died an unnatural death.  It won’t be wrong to say that the advent of Bristhers in India led to the death of groundwater exploration in Indian Himalayas.In 1991 groundwater development was started in Himachal Pradesh with exploration and drilling of few trial borewells and it turned out to be successful scheme to provide instant water. However initially the method of exploration was based on remote sensing which was more of hit and trial method and the traditional method of resistivity survey was not applicable due to non- homogeneity of the rocks in the Himalayas owing to complex folding and faulting.In 1993 the author was posted as Hydrogeologist @ 82.80 paisa in Barsar and the Panj Singho Ka kila became the source of enlightment for establishing the method of exploration and development of the groundwater resources. Borewell drilled upto 300 feet in Barsar bus stand was dry near but the author was able to find 2 wells in the fort at an elevation of more than 1500 feet from the site. Prior to this incident  60-70% success rate based on remote sensing monitoring was considered to be 100% but with the traditional technique using NO SATTELITE IMAGERY and NO INSTRUMENTS even 99.99 per cent was not acceptable. It took 3 years based on borewell data of >5000 borewells across Himachal to master the traditional techquine of exploration and in 1996 the author presented the paper on Hydrostratigraphic zonation  in International Geological Congress China.  Word Hydrostratigraphic Zonation was coined and Principles of Isostasy and water balancing was used to explain the movement of groundwater in the 7 Hydrostratigraphic zones of the Himalayas.  6 Zones were identified in Himachal Himalaya and the 7th zone was in Indus Suture Zone in High Altitude cold Mountain deserts of Ladakh. In 1997 the author got the opportunity to explore and develop groundwater in the High altitude cold mountain deserts of Ladakh by a project funded by Water Aid through his Holiness Dalai Lama to provide drinking water to the 3800 Tibetans who migrated from Tibet following Chinese aggression in 1959. Prior schemes were based on tapping surface water resources which were susceptible to seasonal fluctuations of silting in summers and freezing in winters. By1998 the entire Tibetan community in Ladakh @ altitude range from 11000 to 14500 feet had 24x7 water from groundwater. But these projects were all along or near the Indus Suture Zone and still the model had to be tested in exteme climatic conditions in the Trans Himalayan region. In 2000 I had the chance to explore and drill groundwater at Air Force Station Thoise, Field Research Laboratory Partapur and Siachen Glacier- The Highest Battlefield in the world. Prior to that the Airfield at Thoise were rendered non-functional in winters as the underground water pipes would burst. Similarly, the silt in pipes from Shyok river in summers would block the pipes and render the water in the agricultural fields to be useless. Moreover the soldiers in Siachen were forced to melt Ice to quench their thirst. In 2000 groundwater exploration and development was done and since then all the water problem is solved and agricultural production increased many fold and groundwater  boosted  the morale of our troops by providing them perineal water even in – 40 Degrees temperature when  groundwater was drilled at Bhimbat in Drass the coldest place in Asia and second coldest place in the world. The entire Himalayas today have the potential to explore and develop groundwater. Groundwater is the cheapest form of clean safe water available to the hilly people on sustainable basis. While doing so the author was able to explore and drill artesian water conditions in Ladakh at altitude of 11500 feet and 14260 feet and earn his ame in Guinness world record. It is pity that some reports in national and international media and scientific journal are still reporting depletion of groundwater resources and building a fearful picture but our practical studies have shown that not even 1cm of groundwater level has gone down in the last 27 years.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Geothermal Energy -Key Player in Future Safe Energy Solutions by Ritesh AryaGeothermal energy is seen as a most economical 24 x 7 energy in present days. The United Nations ... more Geothermal energy is seen as a most economical 24 x 7 energy in present days. The United Nations estimates global reserves at about 200 GW. ENEL Green Power has reported 1'263 MW of installed geothermal power capacity in 2015 and expects 2'144 MW by 2020. In 2015 the USA led the world in geothermal electricity with 3450 MW production followed by the Philippines, Indonesia, Mexico, Italy, New Zealand. Iceland has the highest percentage share of geothermal energy (5245 GWh) of their national electricity production and is now planning to export the surplus geothermal energy to Europe through submarine cables. Africa has great potential and initial experiments in the Kenya Rift valley and in Ethiopia have yielded good results. Today geothermal energy is cheaper than Hydropower in Kenya and they have a much cheaper source of fuel to replace fossil fuels on a sustainable basis. After the Fukushima Nuclear disaster the Japanese government was forced to shut down over 40 nuclear plants and shifts its focus to more geothermal energy to meet its energy requirements. Geothermal holds the key to solve the energy problem of the far over 2 Billion population of India and China on one hand and provides sustainable cheap and safe energy solutions to the MENA region. Agneyodgara (Lava Energy)-GEOCOGEN geothermal energy concepts aimed to produce plenty of GWh clean energy by tapping lava energy in geologically favorable environments at shallow depths use waste water from municipal waste and geothermal heat from earth to produce clean water and energy. The United Nations calls for "Sustainable Energy for All " coupled with the International Energy Organization's commitments of achieving universal energy access by using 100% renewable energy. Geothermal Energy holds one of the golden keys to fulfilling these objectives besides ending nuclear power plants which are bombs for our future generation on one hand and on the other hand the dependence on fossil fuel must be reduced. According to the International Sustainable Energy Organization ISEO geothermal solutions will not only provide sustainable, but also abundant economical and SAFE energy for all by 2050. Biography Dr Ritesh Arya Guinness World record holder is doctor in geology with interest in Water, Energy and Climate. His Mission is "Right to Free Safe Sustainable " Water & Energy " for All by 2050. He started his carrier as hydrogeologist to provide sustainable drinking water solutions based on groundwater development on NO WATER-.NO MONEY basis for civil uses and army. He worked with WaterAid to provide water solutions for Tibetans who migrated from Tibet in 1959 and settled in the Ladakh High altitude cold mountain deserts of the Himalaya, India. Today this group has rightly titled Dr Ritesh Arya "The Incredible Waterman". The Agneyodgara (Lava Energy)-GEOCOGEN concept developed by him to produce Giga Watts of green, clean, safe, FREE sustainable energy for all and was rated as " He presented Arya's C cycle-based on paleo climatic signatures discovered by him to show Climate change is a natural cyclic process, but pollution is manmade and needs to be tackled by improving technology by the Global Conference on Global Warming in 2015.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Agneyodgara (Lava Energy)-Indian scenario and need for sustainable geothermal development Ritesh AryaAgneyodgara (Lava Energy)-Indian scenario and need for sustainable geothermal development Ritesh ... more Agneyodgara (Lava Energy)-Indian scenario and need for sustainable geothermal development Ritesh Arya Two years have passed since the 1 st Geothermal conference in PDPU was held paving way for CEGE formation, preparation of draft policy on geothermal by MNRE , exploration work on geothermal sites in Gujrat and tendering done to tap geothermal energy in Tatapani, but still the pace to develop the known potential of more than 10000 MWe geothermal energy resource is comparatively slower than other renewable resources. Private players like GIBBS have set up Geoexchange heating and cooling plants in India and are trying to show practically how geothermal energy exchange can help save electricity and provide sustainable round the year geo-conditioning solutions with the installation of GSHP besides saving million liters of water in the traditional air conditioning chillers. In comparison to this the world is moving fast on the geothermal front with 13GW added till 2015 to provide sustainable cheap electricity to millions who were without it or were using expensive fossil fuel which was the root cause of their bad economy. Here I will like to site the example of Kenya who have come a long way from investing in expensive Fossil fuel prices to uncertain Hyropower production as both were not able to power their house on sustainable basis for the simple reason and that is the uncertainty in terms of resource and its pricing. But with the functioning of Kenya's 280 MW Olkaria geothermal power plant, the largest in the world, things have turned the entire economy and provided sustainable energy source round the clock. The energy thus generated will power the homes, institutions, agriculture and help boost industry in that region on sustainable basis besides saving money on expansive fossil fuel. Within few months the energy from geothermal power plant has been cheaper and economically sustainable then hydropower and reduced dependency on expensive OIL. That is the power of geothermal development. India has been the masters of geothermal development and its utilistion in the past. Known records show that GURU Vashist (3000BC) after whom the Vashist Hot springs are named in Himalayas was the first to use the hot springs in his ashram and the concept of treating different alignment was well developed and is still practised by AMCHIS (traditional Tibetan doctors) in Chumathang and Puga Similarly Mani Karan in Himachal Pradesh shows that the art of extracting minerals, precious stones was very well know from the HOT spring sources in ancient times. Inspite of the fact that Guru nanak ji prepared the 1st Geothermal food in India more then 500 years ago and showed the world the way to utilise how FREE food could be cooked using this unheard Hot water energy resource. Little is done and today we are struggling to see India on the Geothermal map of the world. Now time has come and we should learn from the practical examples demonstrated by the ICELAND, US, New Zealand Italy Indonesia Philippines and see how they have managed to struggle and standardize the process of geothermal exploration and development so that we get the best of everything and learn from their mistakes to develop the best geothermal power plants in the world for our FUTURE Generations. Vision of Agneyodgara (Lava Energy) is to tap geothermal energy at shallow depths in geologically favorable locations to produce upto GIGA watts of power using the futuristic Geocogen technology and set up Agneyodgara sites worldwide to replace all the Nuclear Power Plants which are Nuclear bombs for our future generations.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Present paper highlights th... more Abstract TitleHydrogeology of the Hindu kush HimalayasAbstract TextPresent paper highlights the recent advances made in the hydrogeological sciences in the Hindu Kush Himalayan region based on thedata collected from 25000 borewells drilled in different hydrostratigraphic zones identified by Arya, 1996 to solve the drinking waterand meet the growing industrial and agricultural requirements in the hills states of north west Indian Himalayas Historical developmentof groundwater resources and need of traditional methods of exploration will be highlighted to systematically develop thegroundwater resources in comparison to the modern geophysical and remote sensing methods. Borehole data from the wells drilledon the snouts of highland glaciers in the cold mountain deserts of Ladakh will be used to know the extent and rates at which theglaciers might have receded in the past. Preliminary investigations have revealed that global warming is a natural phenomenon andman and his activities after the industrial revolution in 1600th century had little role to enhance the already receding glaciers most ofthem have already become extinct in the lesser Himalayan region during those times. Attempt is made to use groundwater levels inthe borewells drilled along the major faults and contact boundaries in these Himalayan regions as a tool to monitor the crustalmovements and earthquakes. Borehole data will also be used to infer the paleo flooding activities in the past which led to theextinction of major habitations and civilisations in the past. A cycle event (?) which can trigger today because of occupation ofagricultural lands for economic compulsions in the low lying regions along the banks of rivers.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Groundwater development in North Western Indian Himalayas: A review - Ritesh AryaGroundwater development in North Western Indian Himalayas: A review
Ritesh Arya, 405 ,GH7A sector... more Groundwater development in North Western Indian Himalayas: A reviewRitesh Arya, 405 ,GH7A sector 20, Panchkula, Haryana 134120Email: aryadrillers@gmail.comPhone : 0172-2552106;Mobile: 09417040106Present paper highlights the significance of groundwater exploration and its systematic exploitation for overall sustainable water development to solve the drinking, agricultural and industrial requirement of the people residing in the hill states of north western Indian Himalayas besides giving an historical perspective for the development of the resource. With more then 15000 boreholes drilled in different hydrostratigraphic zones identified by Arya 1996, it can be said with certainty that groundwater resource development has been a success story in solving the water problem to some extent. Questions about its quantity and sustainability still remain unanswered. Moreover lack of any scientific documentation and its modeling has not led to its further development into a full fledged dependable water resource, which can be relied and used by the policy makers to plan major water supply schemes.Therefore, inspite of the fact that millions of rupees are being spent in the name of providing drinking water by the government the overall situation in the hill state still remains a problem as the dependency and uncertainty associated with the schemes based on surface water has increased proportionately.Paper also presents the success story of successfully encountering of the artesian conditions at altitude of more then 14000 feet by the author in the high altitude cold mountain deserts of Ladakh which clearly speaks volumes about the amount of groundwater prevalent in the heights of the Himalayan mountains. Successful flowing of groundwater resources from the artesian wells drilled 7 years ago and its successful availability in minus 20 degrees in Siachen Glacier shows the availability of this resource and its importance in solving the drinking water problem on sustainable basis in the extreme geological and climatic conditions. Moreover the present study also focuses on the impact of global warming on the groundwater resources especially in the mountains. Paper also highlights the point that these resources play in activating flash flooding and inducing landslides leading to rock collapse in the mountain regions. Their role in helping to monitor earthquakes by studying groundwater fluctuation and its chemical composition will also be emphasized. .Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Borewell samples analysed from thewells drilled clearly show that global warming and cooling processes are like day and night. They are essentialpart of the global climate natural cycle which act in uniform to continuously change the various landforms onthis mother earth and make it geomorphologicaly so beautiful.Holding man and his activities responsible for pollution is acceptable truth but holding him responsible forglobal warming is an Inconvenient Truth, because man is too small to cause any changes of global scale onsustainable basis.This Paper emphasise the use of proper technology to improve production and decrease pollution on one handand recommends use of renewable energy resources so that pure air can be made available to all. It alsoemphasises the need to re-examine the global warming definition as proposed by IPCC which holds man andhis activities for increased global warming in recent years. Experiments carried by the author while drillingwells in the Indus Basin clearly show that major glaciers including the Indus Glacier which extended fromMansarovar in Tibet to Arabian sea melted much before the advent of Industrialisation and rates of receding ofglaciers though unknown were much faster then are being projected and related to the activities of man.Global warming has to be viewed in a different perspective where it is related to the influx of increased waterin the natural system so that sediments deposited during global cooling times can be transported to riversand oceans. Act in a similar way as the scavengers cleaning the earth and transporting them in the oceans.Cyclones, tsunamis, Flash floods, sea level rise, land submergence and glacial retreat are prominent andnatural agencies responsible for the various processes of the global warming and helping her to transport thedeposited material into the rivers/oceans. In this context man with his modern excavating machinery can alsobe called one of his agencies because he is also digging and at times transporting the deposits. Time hascome to put things about global warming, straight, before it is too late.Associating global warming to activities of man as proposed by IPCC, contributing to increased green housegases, leading to enhanced temperatures, or faster melting rates of glaciers will only make things worsebecause the definition does not explain the process in totality.With little precaution while selecting the site for habitation near the coasts or glacio-fluvial valleys impactsof global warming like cyclones, flash flooding, land submergence etc can be minimised. Today technicians(chemists, physics, biologists, and radiologist) have become doctors of mother earth, whereas geologists whoare real doctors of mother earth are less listened to by the politicians for reasons best known to them.Imagine living in Antarctica or Greenland for the rest of the life without water, without cyclones, without floods.It will lead to out extinction.So it’s high time, we learn to ”Enjoy global warming” otherwise what are we going to do in global coolingtimes.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
