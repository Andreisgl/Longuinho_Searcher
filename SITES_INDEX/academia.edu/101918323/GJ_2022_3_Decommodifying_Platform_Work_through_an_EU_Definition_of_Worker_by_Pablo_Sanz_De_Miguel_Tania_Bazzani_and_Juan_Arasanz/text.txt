This model dates back to Fordism, when it was established as a regulatory model and a social norm which normatively prescribed what (male) workers could expect from a "normal" employment relationship (stability, predictable labour career, regular working time schedules, etc.). As a result, working under a non-standard form of employment was considered to be atypical and circumscribed to exceptional circumstances .See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersGlocalismDECOMMODIFYING PLATFORM WORK THROUGH AN EU DEFINITION OF WORKER2023 • Pablo  Sanz de MiguelThis article aims to highlight the process of recommodification characterizing the new forms of work today, in particular gig economy jobs, and the possible solutions that can be suggested to guarantee adequate protection. After having explained the importance of labour law to decommodify the new forms of work, in particular platform work, this article explains the different ways to legally classify them at the national level and the relevant contribution an EU definition of worker could bring to address the problem of recommodification. In doing this, the article also mentions some relevant aspects of the EU proposal for a directive in the field.Download Free PDFView PDFThe classification of on-demand platform workers in Spain; the intermediate category European Employment LawCarmen AguayoDownload Free PDFView PDFRevista CIDOB d'Afers InternacionalsGig economy workers in the European Union: towards changing their legal classification2022 • Revista CIDOB d'Afers InternacionalsWhile the classification of gig economy workers under European labour law has been controversial for many years, the COVID-19 pandemic made it a priority. The role of the gig economy has changed: from being an employment option that provides supplementary income, it has become many people's main income source, which is why the European Union (EU) announced its intention to address this issue. In 2021, there was intense activity around gig economy jurisprudence across Europe, with supreme courts in several member states making judgements and new laws classifying the participants in this sector of the labour market. This paper draws on three case studies-from the UK, the Netherlands and Spain-to explore recent developments in gig economy jurisprudence and to draw conclusions for the future.Download Free PDFView PDFPost Blog (2018, Diciembre) – Employment status of platform workers (national courts decisions overview – Australia, Brazil, Chile, France, Italy, United Kingdom, United States & Spain)2018 • Ignasi  Beltran de Heredia RuizOn November 16, I had the opportunity to participate in the round table of the III Annual Conference of the Institute of Labor Studies of the Autonomous University of Barcelona, hold in Barcelona and dedicated to the future of work. My intervention focused on the employment status discussion of platform workers in national courts (as far as my knowledge reaches, at least, in the following countries: Australia, Brazil, Chile, France, Italy, United Kingdom, United States and Spain). In my opinion, this analysis suggests that a 'false debate regarding dependence or subordination' is taking place, in particular because the fact that the service is developed through platforms (offline and online) does not weak by itself this substantial trait. Thus, without denying the challenges that this new reality poses, which affect several employment contract's aspects, I defend the non-obsolescence of the characteristics of paid employment in this environment. In other words, I'm far from the initiatives that plead the " independent worker " status nor independent contractor (see for a full detailed explanation in this paper – Spanish). The main purpose of this post is to compile these judicial decisions and offer a descriptive non exhausthive overview, highliting certain aspects of the considerations (in any case, I apologize in advance if anyDownload Free PDFView PDFEuropean Labour Law JournalPlatform work and fixed-term employment regulationAnnika RosinAlthough platform work has been studied by many labour law researchers, mainly the unclear labour law status of platform workers as well as possible new avenues to ensure their protection have been discussed. However, platform work is similar to already-regulated atypical work arrangements and the possibilities of the application of these regulations needs to be analysed. The aim of this article is to analyse the applicability of the Fixed-Term Work Directive (1999/70/EC (FTWD)) to platform workers. The question of whether platform work can be regarded as fixed-term employment according to the FTWD is analysed, and also whether the measures to prevent the abuse of successive fixed-term contracts ensure that platform workers avoid being placed in a precarious position. In the example of four platforms (Uber, Deliveroo, TaskRabbit and Amazon Mechanical Turk), it is argued that many platform workers can be regarded as fixed-term workers for the purposes of the FTWD.

Why Labor Law Fails at Platform Work, and What Can We Do about It?2021 • Bernát TörökGig-work, or platform work, has been in the crosshairs of regulators since roughly the mid-2010s. The employment of an increasing number of platform workers raises a number of problems, however, there is no longer a consensus as to whether these problems are only the emergence of certain well-established labor law issues in a new guise, or completely new ones. To date, only one possible solution seems to have emerged, that of bringing platform work under the umbrella of labor law. This study argues, on the one hand, that platform work has a characteristic that was previously unknown in the world of labor relations (algorithmic and data-based work organization) and, on the other hand, that it has two other characteristics (tripartite structure and network effect) that create an entirely new quality that requires innovative legal approaches. The study selects some of the recent European Union standards regulating various kinds of online platforms which may also provide useful solution...Download Free PDFView PDFRevista ContracampoThe grey zone of work and employment, workers on digital platforms and on-demand dock workers: labour rights beyond the employment relationship2020 • Rodrigo de Lacerda CarelliThe article analyzes, based on the notion of the grey zone of work and employment, the nature of the relationship between workers and digital platforms, establishing a parallel between Uber drivers and the on-demand dock workers, to demonstrate the possibility of applying the protection of labour law without the need to discuss the existence of employment relationship between the platforms and the on-demand workers mediated by it, given the similarity of characteristics between the two emerging figures, especially their vulnerabilities and their shared nature of work on demand.Download Free PDFView PDFLabor Platforms and Gig Work: The Failure to RegulateVeena DubalSince 2012, the platform economy has received much academic, popular, and regulatory attention, reflecting its extraordinary rate of growth. This paper provides a conceptual and theoretical overview of rapidly growing labor platforms, focusing on how they represent both continuity and change in the world of work and its regulation. We first lay out the logic of different types of labor platforms and situate them within the decline of labor protections and the rise of intermediated employment relations since the 1970s. We then focus on one type of labor platform—the ondemand platform—and analyze the new questions and problems for workers and the political problem of labor regulation. To examine the politics of regulating labor on these platforms, we turn to Uber, which is the easiest case for labor regulation due to its high degree of control over work conditions. Because Uber drivers are atomized and ineffective at organizing collectively, their issues are most often represented by surrogate actors—including plaintiffs’ attorneys, alt labor groups, unions, and even Uber itself—whose own interests shape the nature of their advocacy for drivers. The result of this type of politics, dominated by concentrated interests and surrogate actors, has been a permissive approach by regulators in both legislative and judicial venues. If labor regulation has not occurred in this “easy” case, it is unlikely to occur for gig work on other labor platforms.Download Free PDFView PDFETUI Policy BriefDoes it pay to work? Unpaid labour in the platform economy2021 • Markieta Domecka, Karol Muszynski, Agnieszka  PiasnaUnpaid labour should be recognised as a systemic feature of platform work, inherent in its current model of work organisation. Its prevalence and magnitude render it a pressing regulatory issue. Introducing minimum standards regarding working time and wages is a key step towards limiting unpaid labour and establishing fairer working conditions. Limiting unpaid labour requires recognition of the subordinate status of large segments of workers, improvements in employment stability and a floor of contractually guaranteed working hours. Platform work within the framework of hourly-paid employment is less frequently linked to unpaid work than piece-rate and self-employment models. But without predictability of hours, hourly-paid employment can also lead to unpaid labour.Download Free PDFView PDFSolidar Thematic PublicationWorking for Nothing in the Platform Economy: Forms and institutional contexts of unpaid labour2021 • Claudia MaràThis paper aims to offer an in-depth account on the forms and conditions of unpaid labour in the platform economy, as these represent a crucial element in the way that working lives are precarious under platform labour regimes.
