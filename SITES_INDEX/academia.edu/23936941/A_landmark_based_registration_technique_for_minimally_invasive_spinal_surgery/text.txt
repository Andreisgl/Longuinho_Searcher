A landmark based registration technique for minimally invasive spinal surgeryRequest PDFA landmark based registration technique for minimally invasive spinal surgery2013 IEEE International Symposium on Consumer Electronics (ISCE), 2013Atul  KumarAbstractABSTRACT This paper proposed a technique for skin curve registration based on landmark detection and calibrated camera-projector system for medical purpose. The technique applies the algorithm which registers a precalculated 3D model for the 2D images of the video frames. The algorithm first calculates the 3D locations of landmarks based upon the calibrated camera projector system and the matching the landmarks in the 3D model using CT-scan. We then generate the image to be projected on the skin curve of a patient from the registered 3D spinal model, and it is created for projecting on the pork or real patient for surgeons to process surgical procedure by utilizing their natural eyes system. The experiments demonstrate the proposed registration method on both animal and real patient and evaluated by several surgeons for spinal surgery.Atul  Kumar hasn't uploaded this paper.Let Atul know you want this paper to be uploaded.Ask for this paper to be uploaded.Request PDFRelated topicsRelated topicsSurgeryAugmented RealityNeurophysiologyImage RegistrationBiomedical ImagingCalibrationSkinImage SensorsSolid ModelingAboutPressBlogPeoplePapersTopicsJob Board We're Hiring! Help CenterFind new research papers in:PhysicsChemistryBiologyHealth SciencesEcologyEarth SciencesCognitive ScienceMathematicsComputer ScienceTermsPrivacyCopyrightAcademia ©2023
