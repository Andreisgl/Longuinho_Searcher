LONDON, (CMC):
Trinidadian teenager Keshorn Walcott pulled off a stunning upset in the men's javelin, as the Trinidad and Tobago athlete celebrated gold on the final day of track and field at the London Olympics yesterday.
Walcott outshone far more experienced rivals with a tremendous throw of 84.58 metres.

The twin-island also managed bronze in the men's sprint relay, albeit it in fortuitous circumstances after third past the line Canada were disqualified.

"[It has] not caught up to me yet so I have not yet realised what I have done."
