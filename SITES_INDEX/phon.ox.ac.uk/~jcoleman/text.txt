Epenthetic vowels in Tashlhiyt Berber
Variation in
            the qualities of epenthetic vowels in Tashlhiyt Berber
Many of the phonetic transcriptions given below are linked to sound clips
      (.wav files). Except in transcriptions marked with an initial D, the
      speaker is Mohamed Elmedlaoui. (Starred transcriptions were spoken by
      Lahcen Damiri.) The examples follow the numbering of examples given in J.
      Coleman (2000), The Phonetics and Phonology of Tashlhiyt Berber Syllabic
      Consonants, in Transactions of the Philological Society, for which
      this page was specifically composed. 
A postscript version of an earlier (1999) paper of mine, The Nature of
      Vocoids Associated with Syllabic Consonants in Tashlhiyt Berber. In J. J.
      Ohala, Y. Hasegawa, M. Ohala, D. Granville and A. C. Bailey, eds. Proceedings
of
        The XIVth International Congress of Phonetic Sciences. Vol. 1.
      735-8,  can be downloaded from here. 
But
      please note that the analysis given in the Transactions paper is different
      from the ICPhS paper, as I have abandoned the idea that different
      qualities of epenthetic vowels might be contrastive. 
Examples of
              Tashlhiyt syllabic consonants
Some Tashlhiyt words
          which, according to Dell and Elmedlaoui, consist entirely of
          consonants: 
       
      
(7) 
/tf̩tk̩̩ts̩tt/
`you sprained
                  it'
/tl̩di/
`she
                  pulls'
/ts̩kr̩t/
`you did'
/tn̩ʃf̩t/
`you grazed
                  the skin'
/tχ̩zn̩t/
`you stored'
Labialization of velar
          and uvular obstruents is usually contrastive, e.g. D/ikti/ `hot' vs. D/ikwti/ `recall'. Consonants may
          be contrastively geminate, even in word-initial position:
       
      
(9a)
/t̩tsχ̩χan/
`dip (in
                  sauce)'
b)
/t̩tbd̩dal/
`exchange'
c)
/t̩ˁtˁaʒin/
`plate'
d)
/s̩ʃ/
`eat'
e)
/t̩ˁtˁaf/
`hold'
f)
/t̩ˁtˁasˁ/
`sleep'
g)
D/t̩tg̩wgwa/
`be washing
                  clothes'
h)
D/t̩tg̩ga/
`be'
                  [progressive]
As in many other
          Afroasiatic languages, many words are formed by intercalating
          independent vowel and consonant melodies, e.g. singular D/aʃakwʃ/ 'pile of stones', plural D/iʃukaʃ/. 
        
        
Phonetics of
              Tashlhiyt syllabics
The tap(s) of the
          alveolar sonorant /r/ are almost always accompanied by short, central
          vocoids of an [ə]-like
          quality: 
       
      
(14a)
/afruχ/
[afəruχ]
`boy'
                  (optional [ə])
/tafruχt/
[tɛfəɾʊχt]
`girl'
b)
/aʁwrrˁaf/
[aʁwrˁ:af]
`bowl with
                  handle'
c)
/aʁwrˁmi/
[aʁwŏɾʊmɪ̆]
`date-stone'
/aggwrn/
[ag:wʊɾə̆n]
`flour'
/aqwrˁnˁif/
[aqwŏɾə̆nif]
`palm bough'
Dell and Elmedlaoui
          (1985) analyzed CC-initial words such as /kdˁu/ `smell', /gbu/ `pierce' etc. as having complex onsets.
          However, I analyse them as CəC-, so that e.g. [kdˁu] is phonological disyllabic
        /kədˁu/. 
(16a) /kwdˁiχ/ `he smelled' is realised as [kʊdˁiχ] (with 2 voicing intervals,
        [ʊ] and [i])
          in 9/10 tokens and as [kwdˁiχ] (with only [i] voiced) in 1 token out of 10.
b) /ikwbar/ `squirrels' is realised as
          D[ikʊbar] (with 3 voicing intervals, [i], [ʊ] and [a])
          in 8/10 tokens and [ikwbar] (with 2 voicing intervals,
        [i] and [a])
          in 2/10 tokens. 
c) /kdˁu/ `smell!' is realised as [kədˁu] in 8/10 tokens and as [kdˁu] in 2/10 tokens. 
The longest tokens of
          epenthetic [ʊ]
          in my recordings of Elmedlaoui's speech occur in /ʃʃʁw[ʊ]rˁʃ/
          `beat!' (duration of [ʊ] = 66 ms), /akw[ʊ]r/ `to steal' (54 ms), and /agw[ʊ]l/ `to hang' (58 ms). For
          comparison, the shortest tokens of the lexical vowel /u/ are /jukrr/ `he drags', /jugl/ `he hung' ([u] duration = 44 ms), and /ugmn/ `they drew (water)' (39 ms). In
          Elmedlaoui's pronunciation of [managu], [u] duration was 53 ms, whereas in [aggwrn], the vocoid before [r] has
          a duration of 57 ms.

Some results of
              the distribution analysis
Epenthesis was never
          observed between two voiceless consonants, except for one instance of
        /qs/
          in the word /lˁqsˁtˁtˁ/ `poem', but this phonemic
          representation may be wrong. It is a nativized loan from the Arabic al
            qasˁiida. Damiri considered the correct phonemic
          transcription to be /lˁqsˁitˁtˁ/, which he pronounced with the vowel [i].
          But Elmedlaoui amended this transcription to /lˁqsˁtˁtˁ/, pronounced with an
          epenthetic [ɛ],
        [lˁqɛsˁtˁtˁ]. 
Pronunciations by
          Elmedlaoui of two words in particular are highly problematic for Dell
          and Elmedlaoui's account of epenthesis. First, /nʃfat/ `skin! (v. pl.)' was pronounced [ənʃfat], with an initial epenthetic [ə].
          This is unsurprising if the initial /nʃ/ is a syllable coda preceded by an empty
          nucleus (i.e. /(ə)nʃ.fat/).
          Since the preceding word, /za/, ends in a vowel, it is possible that
          the initial epenthetic [ə] of [ənʃfat] reflects the articulatory transition
          from [ə]
          to [n].
          Second, both tokens of /tmzħ/ (token 1, token 2) `she jested' were
          spoken with a final epenthetic [æ]. 
        
        
Minimally
              distinct diphones
Each pair of words in
          (20) has a common sequence of two consonants, listed in the second
          column. According to Dell and Elmedlaoui's proposal, therefore, they
          should have the same epenthetic vowel or secondary articulation
          qualities. However, they do not. Those on the left have markedly
          fronter qualities than those on the right.

/ismuqql/[qʊl] `he waited'
c)
gl
/trglt/[gɪlj] `you locked'
/jugl/[gʊl] `he hung'
In the word pairs
          listed in (21), those on the left have rounded syllabic consonants,
          whereas those on the right have unrounded consonants.

/tajdrt/[dəɾət]`ear of wheat'
c)
gl
/jugl/[gʊl]`he hung'
/trglt/[gɪlj] `you locked'
In (21), rounded
          epenthetic vowels are found in words containing /u/, and unrounded
          epenthetic vowels in words lacking /u/. (22a) has a syllabic with a
          closer secondary articulation than the corresponding syllabic in
          (22b). In this example, it is unclear how the phonological environment
          might affect the quality of the epenthetic vowel.

bʁ
a) D/abʁjus/[bɤʁ] `stupid person'
b)
                  D/tsbʁt/[bʌʁ] `you painted'
In addition to these
          binary contrasts, I have also found some ternary contrasts of
          secondary articulation, such as:

                    close:
D/kmmi/[kɪm] `you' [f.2sg.]

                    open:
D/uglχkm/[kəm]`I hung you' [f.2sg.]
c)
Close,
                    back, rounded:
D/akmmus/[kʊmw] `bundle' [n.sg.]
In (23a) the secondary
          articulation of the syllabic is clear, [ɪ]-like; in (23b), it is central, and
          neither especially clear nor dark; and in (23c) it is labiovelarized.
          This set of distinctions parallels the system of full vowels in
          Tashlhiyt. The epenthetic vowel of (23a) may anticipate the subsequent
          vowel /i/, and that of (23c) the subsequent /u/. However, the range of
          phonetic distinctions in the secondary articulation of syllabic
          consonants is not restricted to [ɪ]-like, [ʊ]-like and [ɐ]-like:
          a few groups of words containing a syllabic consonant with a wide
          variety of secondary articulations from the interior of the vowel
          space is presented in (24).

Variation in
              quality of epenthetic vowels
Although the existence
          of variation can be demonstrated, it is not the case that epenthetic
          vowels are always of a particular category for a given word. For
          example, the epenthetic vowels [ɤ] and [ɐ] are both found after [k] in different tokens of /jukrr/ `he drags', [ʊ] and [ʏ] after [r] in /turmt/ `you tasted', [ʏ]and [ɐ] (again) after [dˁ] in /tsdˁrˁtˁ/ `you let fall', [ɪ],
        [Ï]
          or [ɐ]
          after [k]
          in /trkst/ `you hid', and [ɤ] or [ə] after [t] in /trksas/ `she hid him'. Many other such examples
          could be given. Therefore, though the occurrence of epenthetic vowels
          is best explained by the presence of a phonologically empty nuclei in
          the syllabification of a word, their qualities are not given in the
          lexicon, contrary to my proposal in Coleman (1996, 1999).
        
        
Vowel-vowel
              coarticulation?
In many of the
          examples presented above, local context appears to play a role in
          determining these fine-grained details. However, the direction and
          domain of coarticulation is not clear from the data currently
          available. Disharmonious examples, such as D/lw[ə]r/ `run away' (not [lwʊr]), are problematic. 
        
        
Phonology of
              Tashlhiyt syllabics
In (30) a Tashlhiyt
          lexical vowel corresponds to a Tamazight lexical schwa; and in (31), a
          syllabic consonant (optionally preceded by an epenthetic vowel) in
          Tashlhiyt corresponds to a lexical schwa or another lexical vowel in
          Tamazight.

In (38c) and (h), my
          parser added epenthetic vowels in places where none were found in Dell
          and Elmedlaoui's transcriptions. But in these two cases, close
          examination of my recordings of Elmedlaoui's pronunciation (click
            on each syllable of the following transcriptions separately)
          shows that the second schwa in [təb.χə.lakkw] and the first schwa in [rəg.ləχ]
        are empirically
          attested epenthetic vowels.
