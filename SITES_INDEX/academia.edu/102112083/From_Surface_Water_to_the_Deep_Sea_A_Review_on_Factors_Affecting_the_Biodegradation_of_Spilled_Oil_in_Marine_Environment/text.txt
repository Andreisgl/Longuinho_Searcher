As the spilled oil can negatively affect the coastal-marine ecosystems, its transport and fates captured a significant interest of the scientific community and regulatory agencies. Typically, the environment has natural mechanisms (e.g., photooxidation, biodegradation, evaporation) to weather/degrade and remove the spilled oil from the environment. Among various oil weathering mechanisms, biodegradation by naturally occurring bacterial populations removes a majority of spilled oil, thus the focus on bioremediation has increased significantly. Helping in the marginal recognition of this promising technique for oil-spill degradation, this paper reviews recently published articles that will help broaden the understanding of the factors affecting biodegradation of spilled oil i...See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersFrontiers in MicrobiologyNatural Sunlight Shapes Crude Oil-Degrading Bacterial Communities in Northern Gulf of Mexico Surface Waters2015 • Hernando BacosaDownload Free PDFView PDFMicroorganismsA Review on Biotechnological Approaches Applied for Marine Hydrocarbon Spills RemediationFarzad  RahmatiThe increasing demand for petroleum products generates needs for innovative and reliable methods for cleaning up crude oil spills. Annually, several oil spills occur around the world, which brings numerous ecological and environmental disasters on the surface of deep seawaters like oceans. Biological and physico-chemical remediation technologies can be efficient in terms of spill cleanup and microorganisms—mainly bacteria—are the main ones responsible for petroleum hydrocarbons (PHCs) degradation such as crude oil. Currently, biodegradation is considered as one of the most sustainable and efficient techniques for the removal of PHCs. However, environmental factors associated with the functioning and performance of microorganisms involved in hydrocarbon-degradation have remained relatively unclear. This has limited our understanding on how to select and inoculate microorganisms within technologies of cleaning and to optimize physico-chemical remediation and degradation methods.

The current chemical method used to treat the ecosystem polluted with diesel is incompetent and expensive for a large-scale treatment. Thus, bioremediation technique seems urgent and requires more attention to solve the existing environmental problems. Biological agents, including microorganisms, carry out the biodegradation process where organic pollutants are mineralized into water, carbon dioxide, and less toxic compounds. Hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria are ubiquitous in the nature and often exploited for their specialty to bioremediate the oil-polluted area. The capability of these bacteria to utilize hydrocarbon compounds as a carbon source is the main reason behind their species exploitation. Recently, microbial remediation by halophilic bacteria has received many positive feedbacks as an efficient pollutant degrader. These halophilic ...Download Free PDFView PDFUnderstanding the behaviour of oil-degrading microorganisms to enhance the microbial remediation of spilled petroleumBabajide MacaulayPetroleum-contamination of both terrestrial and marine environments have persisted as a result of the increasing demand on liquid petroleum globally which has led to the need to clean up spilled petroleum using eco-friendly methods. Of all the petroleum-cleaning techniques explored, the use of petroleum-degrading microbes has received most attention. The microbial remediation of spilled petroleum has been proved to be cost-effective, eco-friendly and sustainable. However, these microbes have been found to thrive under certain environmental/nutritional conditions which influence their behaviour towards spilled petroleum. This study aims to identify the factors responsible for the change in behaviour of oil-degrading microbes which might help facilitate better petroleum spill management. Some of these factors include: the physical nature of the spilled petroleum; chemical nature of the spilled petroleum; availability of nutrients; water temperature; concentration of oxygen; soil region/soil particle size; competition from other micro-organisms. Petroleum-degrading microbes were also found to degrade specific hydrocarbon components in liquid petroleum due to the specific metabolic pathway utilized by individual microbes. This makes the use of a microbial consortium a more aggressive option for the microbial degradation of spilled petroleum than the use of microbial isolates. However, more research on the factors influencing theabundance and productivity of oil-degrading anaerobes may need to be carried out. Also, how oil-degrading microbes can be aided to break down asphalthenes should be investigated.Download Free PDFView PDFMarine pollution bulletinBiodegradation of marine crude oil pollution using a salt-tolerant bacterial consortium isolated from Bohai Bay, China2016 • mohamed adamThis study aims at constructing an efficient bacterial consortium to biodegrade crude oil spilled in China&#39;s Bohai Sea. In this study, TCOB-1 (Ochrobactrum), TCOB-2 (Brevundimonas), TCOB-3 (Brevundimonas), TCOB-4 (Bacillus) and TCOB-5 (Castellaniella) were isolated from Bohai Bay. Through the analysis of hydrocarbon biodegradation, TCOB-4 was found to biodegrade more middle-chain n-alkanes (from C17 to C23) and long-chain n-alkanes (C31-C36). TCOB-5 capable to degrade more n-alkanes including C24-C30 and aromatics. On the basis of complementary advantages, TCOB-4 and TCOB-5 were chosen to construct a consortium which was capable of degrading about 51.87% of crude oil (2% w/v) after 1week of incubation in saline MSM (3% NaCl). It is more efficient compared with single strain. In order to biodegrade crude oil, the construction of bacterial consortia is essential and the principle of complementary advantages could reduce competition between microbes.Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of Marine Science and EngineeringMarine Snow Aggregates are Enriched in Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) in Oil Contaminated Waters: Insights from a Mesocosm StudyPeter H. SantschiMarine snow was implicated in the transport of oil to the seafloor during the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, but the exact processes remain controversial. In this study, we investigated the concentrations and distributions of the 16 USEPA priority polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in marine snow aggregates collected during a mesocosm experiment. Seawater only, oil in a water accommodated fraction (WAF), and Corexit-enhanced WAF (DCEWAF) were incubated for 16 d. Both WAF and DCEWAF aggregates were enriched in heavy molecular weight PAHs but depleted in naphthalene. DCEWAF aggregates had 2.6 times more total 16 PAHs than the WAF (20.5 vs. 7.8 µg/g). Aggregates in the WAF and DCEWAF incorporated 4.4% and 19.3%, respectively of the total PAHs in the mesocosm tanks. Our results revealed that marine snow sorbed and scavenged heavy molecular weight PAHs in the water column and the application of Corexit enhanced the incorporation of PAHs into the sinking aggregates.Download Free PDFView PDFEnergiesComparison of Hydrocarbon-Degrading Consortia from Surface and Deep Waters of the Eastern Mediterranean Sea: Characterization and Degradation PotentialEleftheria  AntoniouThe diversity and degradation capacity of hydrocarbon-degrading consortia from surface and deep waters of the Eastern Mediterranean Sea were studied in time-series experiments. Microcosms were set up in ONR7a medium at in situ temperatures of 25 °C and 14 °C for the Surface and Deep consortia, respectively, and crude oil as the sole source of carbon. The Deep consortium was additionally investigated at 25 °C to allow the direct comparison of the degradation rates to the Surface consortium. In total, ~50% of the alkanes and ~15% of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were degraded in all treatments by Day 24. Approximately ~95% of the total biodegradation by the Deep consortium took place within 6 days regardless of temperature, whereas comparable levels of degradation were reached on Day 12 by the Surface consortium. Both consortia were dominated by well-known hydrocarbon-degrading taxa. Temperature played a significant role in shaping the Deep consortia communities with Pseudomona...Download Free PDFView PDFScience of The Total EnvironmentBiodegradation of marine oil spills in the Arctic with a Greenland perspective2018 • Pia LassenDownload Free PDFView PDFMicrobial Action on HydrocarbonsMicrobes and Petroleum Bioremediation2018 • Milene GomesPetroleum pollution is an environmental issue often reported, including oil spills that occur accidentally worldwide. The release of large quantities of oil causes directly or indirectly huge environmental and economic impacts and may persist for decades. Bioremediation processes, such as biostimulation and bioaugmentation, among others, represent an eco-friendly and effective way to treat impacted areas based on the use of biological agents, associated or not to other compounds like biosurfactants in order to mineralize or complex organic and inorganic pollutant compounds. Therefore, this book chapter will review some topics related to bioremediation, including several in situ and ex situ techniques employed to treat polluted areas and the use of biosurfactants produced by several microorganisms. Moreover, oil spills and how they can affect marine and terrestrial environments are also mentioned, based on recent reports available in literature and according to organizations responsible for environmental impact monitoring. Hydrocarbonoclastic microorganisms have been described in both environments as well as the community dynamics of specific groups as a function of oil compounds input. In marine environments, a high abundance increase of a specific group called “obligate hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria (OHCB)” has been reported after an event involving petroleum contamination. Similar observation has been reported for mangroves, showing that oil or its derivatives allow the selection of microorganisms capable to degrade hydrocarbons. Petroleum contamination in cold environments, as Arctic and Antarctic regions, represents a huge challenge since management of contaminated sites and bioremediation effectiveness in these regions depend on several factors influencing oil degradation under cold conditions facing intrinsic limiting factors. In conclusion, bioremediation is not only a scientific concept described in literature but a concrete and applied efficient tool to treat polluted environments. The increasing number of bioremediation companies and patents also corroborates the tendency in search for new technologies and approaches focusing on sustainable management of polluted areas.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
