The Museum of Perth is a private, non-profit museum located in the Atlas Building, 8-10 The Esplanade (opposite Elizabeth Quay), in Perth, Western Australia. It aims to chronicle the social, cultural, political and architectural history of Perth.
Beginnings[edit]
It began life as a virtual museum on the social media site Twitter in October 2012, created by Dallas Robertson, a museum studies student at Edith Cowan University.[citation needed] It was expanded into Facebook the following year.
Following an online article about the Twitter page from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (Perth) in 2013,[1] Perth City councillor Reece Harley approached Robertson with the view to opening a bricks and mortar version of the museum.[2]
In 2014 the still-virtual museum gained local attention when it led a campaign against the City of Perth to save an art deco factory from demolition,[3] which ultimately failed when a Western Australian state minister intervened to support the local government's decision.[4]
Formation[edit]
By July 2015 the cyber Museum of Perth moved a step closer to reality when the Perth History Association was set up comprising members Dallas Robertson, Reece Harley, Ryan Zaknich, Ryan Mossny, Richard Offen and Diana Warnock. The not-for-profit organisation subsequently founded the Museum of Perth with Reece Harley as executive director.[5][6] In October 2015 the Museum of Perth became a reality, with project manager Alysha Worth employed to oversee its establishment.[7]
Exhibits[edit]
Along with a permanent exhibition on the history of Perth, the museum also contains a micro-cinema and hosts rotating exhibitions on Perth's social history.[8][9]
Events[edit]
The museum also has been involved in the annual Heritage Perth "Perth Heritage Days".[10]
Shaping Perth[11]
Soldiers of Barrack Street[12]
Demolished Icons of Perth[13]
