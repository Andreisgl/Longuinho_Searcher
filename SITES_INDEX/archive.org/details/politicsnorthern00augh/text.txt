In this book, one of the leading authorities on contemporary Northern Ireland politics provides an original, sophisticated and innovative examination of the post-Belfast agreement political landscape. Written in a fluid, witty and accessible style, this book explores:    how the Belfast Agreement has changed the politics of Northern Ireland  whether the peace process is still valid  the problems caused by the language of politics in Northern Ireland  the conditions necessary to secure political stability   the inability of unionists and republicans to share the same political discourse  the insights that political theory can offer to Northern Irish politics  the future of key political parties and institutions.Issue: до 2011-01Edition: First EditionIncludes bibliographical references and index
