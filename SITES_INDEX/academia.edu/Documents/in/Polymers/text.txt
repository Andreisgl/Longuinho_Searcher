We present our experience regarding the immediate posttreatment results of aneurysm embolization using the 2 coil systems. We embolized 219 aneurysms in 187 patients with the use of GDCs and 145 aneurysms in 120 patients with the use of Matrix coils. Age, sex distribution, unruptured aneurysm cases, and multiple aneurysm cases were similar in the 2 groups. The percentage of patients in severe clinical condition was significantly higher in the Matrix group. The mean aneurysm size was slightly larger in the GDC group but the mean neck size was larger in the Matrix group. Satisfactory occlusion (at least 90%) was achieved in 95.9% of GDC-treated aneurysms and in 98.6% of Matrix-treated aneurysms. Procedure-related complications occurred in 19.6% of GDC procedures and in 15.6% of the Matrix ones resulting in procedure-related mortality and morbidity of 3.7% and 2.7% for the GDC g...Save to LibraryDownloadby Vasilios Katsaridis•  15  Polymers, Humans, Female, MaleRecent Trends and Developments in Conducting Polymer Nanocomposites for Multifunctional ApplicationsElectrically-conducting polymers (CPs) were first developed as a revolutionary class of organic compounds that possess optical and electrical properties comparable to that of metals as well as inorganic semiconductors and display the... moreElectrically-conducting polymers (CPs) were first developed as a revolutionary class of organic compounds that possess optical and electrical properties comparable to that of metals as well as inorganic semiconductors and display the commendable properties correlated with traditional polymers, like the ease of manufacture along with resilience in processing. Polymer nanocomposites are designed and manufactured to ensure excellent promising properties for anti-static (electrically conducting), anti-corrosion, actuators, sensors, shape memory alloys, biomedical, flexible electronics, solar cells, fuel cells, supercapacitors, LEDs, and adhesive applications with desired-appealing and cost-effective, functional surface coatings. The distinctive properties of nanocomposite materials involve significantly improved mechanical characteristics, barrier-properties, weight-reduction, and increased, long-lasting performance in terms of heat, wear, and scratch-resistant.

A new range of metal based PLA composites are available providing a novel range of potential engineering materials for such 3-D printers. Currently, limited material data, specifically thermal property characterization is available on these composites. As a result, the application of these materials into functional engineered systems is not possible. This study aims to fill the knowledge gap by quantifying the thermal properties of copperFill, bronzeFill, magnetic iron PLA, and stainless steel PLA composites and provide insight into the technical considerations of FFF composite 3-D printing. Specifically, in this study the correlation of the composite microstructure and printing parameters are explored and the results of thermal conductivity analysis as a function of printed matrix properties are provided. Considering the relative deviation from the filament raw bulk analysis, the results show the printing operation significantly impacts the resultant component density. Experimentally collected thermal conductivity values, however, do not correlate to the theoretical models in the literature and more rigorous quantitative exercises are required to determine true percent porosity to accurately model the effect of air pore volume fraction on thermal conductivity. Despite this limitation, the thermal conductivity values provided can be used to engineer thermal conductivity into 3-D printed parts with these PLA-based composites. Finally, several high-value applications of such 3-D printed materials that look metallic, but have low thermal conductivity are reviewed.Save to LibraryDownloadby Joshua Pearce•  18  Materials Engineering, Polymer Engineering, Materials Science, Polymer scienceRepRapable Recyclebot: Open source 3-D printable extruder for converting plastic to 3-D printing filamentIn order to assist researchers explore the full potential of distributed recycling of post-consumer polymer waste, this article describes a recyclebot, which is a waste plastic extruder capable of making commercial quality 3-D printing... moreIn order to assist researchers explore the full potential of distributed recycling of post-consumer polymer waste, this article describes a recyclebot, which is a waste plastic extruder capable of making commercial quality 3-D printing filament. The device design takes advantage of both the open source hardware methodology and the paradigm developed by the open source self-replicating rapid prototyper (RepRap) 3-D printer community. Specifically, this paper describes the design, fabrication and operation of a RepRapable Recyclebot, which refers to the Recyclebot's ability to provide the filament needed to largely replicate the parts for the Recyclebot on any type of RepRap 3-D printer. The device costs less than $700 in mate rials and can be fabricated in about 24 h. Filament is produced at 0.4 kg/h using 0.24 kWh/kg with a diameter ±4.6%. Thus, filament can be manufactured from commercial pellets for <22% of commercial filament costs. In addition, it can fabricate recycled waste plastic into filament for 2.5 cents/kg, which is <1000X commercial filament costs. The system can fabricate filament from polymers with extrusion temperatures <250 °C and is thus capable of manufacturing custom filament over a wide range of thermopolymers and composites for material science studies of new materials and recyclability studies, as well as research on novel applications of fused filament based 3-D printing.Save to LibraryDownloadby Joshua Pearce•  46  Materials Engineering, Polymer Engineering, Materials Science, Composite Materials and StructuresThe Effect of Extrinsic Factors on the Mechanical Behavior and Structure of Elastic Dental Ligatures and ChainsForce provided by elastomers used in orthodontics can be affected by several factors present in the oral cavity.

The aim of our study was to investigate the role of mouthwashes, toothbrushing, and smoking in the force decay of such elastomers. Tensile strength, changes in the force continuously exerted, and force decay of elastic chains (Ortho Organizer and Masel Short Power Chain) and elastic ligatures (Dentaurum and Masel) by two separate manufacturers were measured. Measurements were initially made on untreated elastics, followed by exposure to different environmental factors including cigarette smoke, toothbrushing (mechanical plaque control), and two different mouthwashes (chemical plaque control). Changes on the surface of the elastics were studied with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Untreated Masel elastic ligature showed lower tensile strength than Dentaurum elastic ligature (2339 cN vs. 3660 cN), while significantly higher tensile strength was measured for Ortho Organi...Save to LibraryDownloadby Fanni Riegler and +3Roland ToldSzalma JózsefPeter Maroti•PolymersRole of Extracellular Polymeric Substances(EPS) in Biofouling of Reverse Osmosis MembranesSave to LibraryDownloadby Seoktae Kang•  20  Biofilms, Calcium, Polymers, Atomic Force MicroscopyFFF 3D Printing in Electronic Applications: Dielectric and Thermal Properties of Selected PolymersThe present study is a focused and comprehensive analysis of the dielectric and thermal properties of twenty-four 3D printed polymers suitable for fused filament fabrication (FFF) in electronic applications.

The selected polymers include various thermoplastic elastomers, such as thermoplastics based on polycarbonate (PC), polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG), and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS-T). Their overall thermal behavior, including oxidation stability, glass transition, and melting temperature, was explored using simultaneous thermal analysis (STA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Considering their intended usage in electronic applications, the dielectric strength (Ep) and surface/volume resistivity (ρs/ρv) were comprehensively tested according to IEC 60243-1 and IEC 62631-3, respectively.

However, several challenges, such as low mechanical properties and difficulty in printing, need to be overcome. Therefore, the effort to improve the NFRC for use in AM has been accelerating in recent years. This review attempts to summarise the current approaches of using NFRC as a feeder for AM. The effects of fibre treatments, composite preparation methods and addition of compatibilizer agents were analysed and discussed. Additionally, current methods of producing feeders from NFRCs were reviewed and discussed. Mechanical property of printed part was also dependent on the printing parameters, and thus the effects of printing temperature, layer height, infill and raster angle were discussed, and the best parameters reported by other researchers were identified.

Moreover, resveratrol is also considered to be a molecule with anti-inflammatory action, an effect attributed to suppression of prostaglandin (PG) biosynthesis. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of resveratrol, a polyphenol present in most red wines, on reactive oxygen species formation as well as on arachidonic acid (AA) release, cyclooxygenase expression, and PG synthesis in murine resident peritoneal macrophages. Results show that resveratrol exerted a strong inhibitory effect on superoxide radical (O2−) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) produced by macrophages stimulated by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) or phorbol esters (PMA). Resveratrol also significantly decreased [3H]AA release induced by LPS and PMA or by exposure to O2− or H2O2. Resveratrol treatment caused a significant impairment of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) induction stimulated by LPS and PMA or by O2− or H2O2 exposure. These effects of resveratrol on [3H]AA release and COX-2 overexpression were correlated with a marked reduction of PG synthesis. Our results indicate that the antioxidant action of resveratrol affects AA mobilization and COX-2 induction.Save to LibraryDownloadby Juan Moreno•  21  Polymers, Flavonoids, Lipopolysaccharide, AntioxidantsPreparation, optimization and characterization of low cost ceramics for the fabrication of dense nickel composite membranesSave to LibraryDownloadby Craig Bunt•  29  Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Analytical Chemistry, Biomedical EngineeringA New Degradable Controlled Release Device for Treatment of Periodontal Disease: In Vitro Release StudySave to LibraryDownloadby Michael Sela•  15  Dentistry, Scanning Electron Microscopy, Polymers, MedicineSynthesis and Characterization of Temperature-Responsive N-Cyanomethylacrylamide-Containing Diblock Copolymer Assemblies in WaterWe have previously demonstrated that poly(N-cyanomethylacrylamide) (PCMAm) exhibits a typical upper-critical solution temperature (UCST)-type transition, as long as the molar mass of the polymer is limited, which was made possible through... moreWe have previously demonstrated that poly(N-cyanomethylacrylamide) (PCMAm) exhibits a typical upper-critical solution temperature (UCST)-type transition, as long as the molar mass of the polymer is limited, which was made possible through the use of reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) radical polymerization. In this research article, we use for the first time N-cyanomethylacrylamide (CMAm) in a typical aqueous dispersion polymerization conducted in the presence of poly(N,N-dimethylacrylamide) (PDMAm) macroRAFT agents. After assessing that well-defined PDMAm-b-PCMAm diblock copolymers were formed through this aqueous synthesis pathway, we characterized in depth the colloidal stability, morphology and temperature-responsiveness of the dispersions, notably using cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and turbidimetry.

The acylation of peptides inside degrading PLA microspheres has been described only recently as another instability mechanism related to the accumulation of polymer degradation products inside eroding PLA. We investigated whether the block copolymerization of PLA with PEG reduces peptide acylation inside degrading microspheres. Diblock copolymers consisting of poly(D,L-lactic acid) covalently bound to poly(ethylene glycol)-monomethyl ether (Me.PEG-PLA) were used for these investigations. Human atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) was incorporated into microspheres manufactured from Me.PEG5-PLA45, a diblock copolymer with an overall PEG content of 10%. Peptide integrity inside the microspheres was monitored by HPLC-MS analysis during 4 weeks of microsphere degradation in isotonic phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at 37 degrees C. Inside the degrading Me.PEG5-PLA45 microspheres, acylation products as well as an oxidation product of ANP were formed. The results demonstrate that the combination of PEG with PLA does not necessarily display a favorable effect concerning peptide acylation inside degrading polymer microspheres. However, they also suggested that the acylation reaction is mainly driven by the formation and accumulation of polymer degradation products inside the degrading microspheres.Save to Libraryby Andrea Gazzaniga and +1Elisabetta Fustella•  16  Biomedical Engineering, Polymers, Block Copolymer, HumansAssessment of the Antigenotoxic Effects of Alginate and ZnO/Alginate–Nanocomposites Extracted from Brown Alga Fucus vesiculosus in MiceMitomycin C (MMC) is an alkylating chemotherapy drug that could induce DNA damage and genetic alteration.

It has been used as a model mutagen for in vivo and in vitro studies. The current study aimed to evaluate the protective role of Zinc oxide alginate–nanocomposites (ZnO-Alg/NCMs) against MMC–induced genotoxicity in mice. Animals were treated as follows: the control group, the groups treated with Algin (400 mg/kg b.w), the groups treated with ZnO-Alg/NCMs (400 mg/kg b.w), the group treated with MMC, and the groups treated with MMC plus Algin or ZnO-Alg/NCMs. Pre-treatment with Algin and ZnO-Alg/NCMs was repeated for one or seven days.

Plastic films viz., Low density polyethylene (LDPE), High density polyethylene (HDPE) and High molecular weight high density polyethylene (HMHDPE) each were incubated in three different conditions viz., black soil, sandy soil and red soil for a period of 3 months. The changes in the properties of plastic films after incubation was studied by change in the weight of the plastic film and mechanical parameters like tensile strength, breaking load and percentage of elongation. Among all the plastic films HDPE was found to be highly susceptible with 33% weight loss and 40% reduction in percentage of elongation compared to LDPE with 26% weight loss and 34 % reduction in percentage of elongation in black soil. Whereas HMHDPE found to be highly resistant in all the soils with no significant weight loss and percentage of elongation (15%). None of the plastic films had shown degradation in sandy soil even after incubation for 3 months. FTIR spectroscopy results showed that HDPE film incubated in black soil had undergone extensive degradation when compared with un incubated HDPE film.Save to LibraryDownloadby Lifescience Global Canada•  4  Polymers, Degradation, Polyethylene, Black SoilsThe Use of Polymer Chitosan in Intravesical Treatment of Urinary Bladder Cancer and InfectionsThe most frequent diseases of the urinary bladder are bacterial infections and bladder cancers.

For both diseases, very high recurrence rates are characteristic: 50–80% for bladder cancer and more than 50% for bladder infections, causing loss of millions of dollars per year for medical treatment and sick leave. Despite years of searching for better treatment, the prevalence of bladder infections and bladder cancer remains unchanged and is even increasing in recent years. Very encouraging results in treatment of both diseases recently culminated from studies combining biopolymer chitosan with immunotherapy, and chitosan with antibiotics for treatment of bladder cancer and cystitis, respectably. In both pathways of research, the discoveries involving chitosan reached a successful long-lasting cure.

We studied the correlation between the mechanical behavior of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-rubber compositions prepared using MQ (mono-(M) and tetra-(Q) functional siloxane) copolymers with different ratios of M and Q parts as a molecular filler. The composition and molecular structure of the original rubber, MQ copolymers, and carboxyl-containing PDMS oligomers were also investigated. The simplicity of the preparation of the compositions, high strength and elongation at break, and their variability within a wide range allows us to consider silicone elastomers as a promising alternative to silicone materials prepared by traditional methods.Save to LibraryDownloadby Artem Bakirov and +2С.

In addition to embodying all the desired characteristics of VBT (i.e., having the ability to undergo a 2π+2π photodimerization reaction upon UV irradiation, a derivatization site, hydrogen bonding sites, and aromatic stacking ability) the bisVBT monomer has the added benefit of having two vinyl groups for cross-polymerization. Copolymerizing the bisVBT monomer with the charged monomer vinylbenzyl triethylammonium (VBA) chloride, different copolymers/terpolymers/cross-linked network were obtained, as it was shown by the absence of the vinyl resonance in the NMR spectra.

This study presents the development and thermo-mechanical characterization of a bio-composite film (TPF/PF), made of thermoplastic banana flour (TPF) matrix and plantain fibers (PF). Fabricated materials were characterized by physical analysis, chemical composition, Fourier-transformed spectroscopy (FTIR), thermal analysis (TGA), mechanical analysis, and scanning electronic microscopy (SEM). The physical analysis showed that TPF and PF have a low density and high affinity to water resulting in a lightweight, renewable, and biodegradable TPF/PF composite.

The application of these materials is carried out when confronting loose paint layers or as a protective coating. However, these materials deteriorate and cause physiochemical alterations to the treated surface. In the past, the monumental neo-gothic wall painting ‘The Last Judgment’ in the chapel of Sint-Jan Berchmanscollege in Antwerp, Belgium was treated with a synthetic polymeric material. This varnish deteriorated significantly and turned brown, obscuring the paint layers. Given also that the varnish was applied to some parts of the wall painting and did not cover the entire surface, it was necessary to remove it in order to restore the original appearance of the wall painting.

We here developed an in vitro model of extravasation composed of (i) a single channel-based 3D cell laden hydrogel representative of the metastatic site, (ii) a circulation system recapitulating the bloodstream where CTCs can flow. Two polymers (i.e., fibrin and alginate) were tested and compared in terms of mechanical and biochemical proprieties. Computational fluid-dynamic (CFD) simulations were also performed to predict the fluid dynamics within the polymeric matrix and, consequently, the optimal culture conditions. Next, once the platform was validated through perfusion tests by fluidically connecting the hydrogels with the external circuit, highly metastatic breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) were inj...Save to LibraryDownloadby Silvia Scaglione•  3  Chemistry, Polymers, MedicineChemistry and physics of a single atomic layer: strategies and challenges for functionalization of graphene and graphene-based materialsGraphene has attracted great interest for its superior physical, chemical, mechanical, and electrical properties that enable a wide range of applications from electronics to nanoelectromechanical systems.

Functionalization is among the significant vectors that drive graphene towards technological applications. While the physical properties of graphene have been at the center of attention, we still lack the knowledge framework for targeted graphene functionalization. In this critical review, we describe some of the important ...Save to LibraryDownloadby Bingqian Xu•  10  Physics, Electronics, Silicon, NanoparticlesRole of the Anilinium Ion on the Selective Polymerization of Anilinium 2-Acrylamide-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonateThe development of anilinium 2-acrylamide-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonate (Ani-AMPS) monomer, confirmed by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and FTIR, is systematically studied.

Ani-AMPS contains two polymerizable functional groups, so it was submitted to selective polymerization either by free-radical or oxidative polymerization. Therefore, poly(anilinium 2-acrylamide-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonic) [Poly(Ani-AMPS)] and polyaniline doped with 2-acrylamide-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonic acid [PAni-AMPS] can be obtained. First, the acrylamide polymer, poly(Ani-AMPS), favored the π-stacking of the anilinium group produced by the inter- and intra-molecular interactions and was studied utilizing 1H NMR, 13C NMR, FTIR, and UV-Vis-NIR. Furthermore, poly(Ani-AMPS) fluorescence shows quenching in the presence of Fe2+ and Fe3+ in the emission spectrum at 347 nm. In contrast, the typical behavior of polyaniline is observed in the cyclic voltammetry analysis for PAni-AMPS. The optical properties also show a significant ch...Save to LibraryDownloadby Alain Salvador Conejo Dávila•  2  Polymers, MedicineEffects of ultrasound on polymeric foam porositySave to LibraryDownloadby Jonathan Corney•  4  Polymers, Porosity, Ultrasonics, PolyurethanesPreparation and Performance of Ultra-Fine Polypropylene Antibacterial Fibers via Melt ElectrospinningPolypropylene (PP) fibers are employed commonly as the raw material of technical textiles (nonwovens), and the research focuses on fine-denier fibers and their functionalities.

In this work, antibacterial PP masterbatches with different dosage (1–5 wt.%) of nano-ZnO particles as the antibacterial agent were prepared via a twin-screw extruder. The as-prepared PP masterbatches were electrospun on a home-made electrospinning device to afford ultra-fine PP fibers. The morphologies of as-spun ultrathin PP fibers with 16 μm of average diameter were observed by SEM. The structure and element distribution were characterized by means of energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and Fourier-transfer infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), respectively. There was some zinc obviously distributed on the surface when a dosage of ZnO more than 1 wt.% was used, which contributed to the antibacterial activity. The crystallinity of PP fibers was not affected strongly by the dosage of ZnO based on the differential s...Save to LibraryDownloadby Xin Ning•PolymersNextLast »Related TopicsPolymer NanocompositesFollowFollowingPolymer scienceFollowFollowingPolymer ChemistryFollowFollowingPolymer CompositesFollowFollowingPolymer synthesisFollowFollowingNanotechnologyFollowFollowingPolymer EngineeringFollowFollowingHydrogelsFollowFollowingBiomaterialsFollowFollowingNanoscienceFollowFollowing 71.6 million researchers use this site every month.
