A registered user is a user who has signed up for an account and has logged in to a Wikimedia project.  In addition to what an unregistered user can do, a registered user can:
Register account
Create pages (which are not discussion pages)
Edit your own preferences
Edit your own watchlist (note that some actions will still add pages even without this right)
Upload files
Mark edits as minor
Move pages
The full list of rights is available at User group rights.
All edits made as a registered user will show the user name in the history instead of an IP address.
Registered users (excepting administrators or Wikimedia Staff) cannot edit or move protected pages. Newly registered users cannot edit semi-protected pages or move any page. Several other minor restrictions, depending on the wiki, may apply to newly-registered users (per phabricator:T14556, media uploads are an autoconfirmed right on most wikis, Commons being a notable exception).
Registered users on Wikimedia Commons include trusted users. As Commons has many Flickr images and requires reviewers to ensure that claimed copyrighted licenses are valid, a registered user familiar with Commons licensing may apply to become a trusted user, which is a user sub-class on Commons. Current Commons administrators need not apply to become trusted users as they already have a higher user class than registered users.
Autoconfirmed status
See also: Newly registered user § Autoconfirmed status
On MediaWiki, there is a pseudo-group called "autoconfirmed" to prevent new accounts from flooding a wiki with low quality or vandalism edits. After an account is a number of days old, or has performed a certain number of edits, the account is given the "autoconfirmed" flag. The thresholds are different for different wikis, though the default configuration is four days delay, with no minimum edit count requirement.
Examples of custom configurations:
English Wikipedia - after four days and 10 edits
Russian Wikipedia - after four days and 15 edits
Italian Wikipedia - after seven days and 50 edits
As of December 2022, the longest waiting periods are 7 days (in de.wikibooks, it.wiki, no.wiki, wuu.wiki, and most zh.* wikis); and the highest edit count requirement is 50 edits (in ar.wiki, es.wiki, it.wiki, zh.wiki and wikidata), whereas the most common custom setting is 10 edits. For an up-to-date of the current settings, review the $wgAutoConfirmAge and $wgAutoConfirmCount arrays in WMF's InitializeSettings.php.
Some requests to increase such limits have been rejected in the past — see Limits to configuration changes.
