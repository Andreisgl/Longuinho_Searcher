However, by primarily allowing one-toone comparisons, they are focused on gene-centered viewpoint and lack the broad aperture needed for complex biological systems analysis. We hypothesized existence of contextual information related to gene’s inclusion in a molecular network of the cell being distributed among more than one sequence. The need for conservation of established interactions, which is arguably more important to the evolutionary success of species than conservation of individual function was the rationale behind this. To test whether this information exists, we applied distributional semantics method Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) to thousands of species proteomes. Using natural language processing we identified Latent Taxonomic Signatures (LTSs), a novel proteome distributed feature supporting the argument that proteincoding genes do not evolve as taxonomy independent variables.

Combinations of long peptide sequence blocks can be used to describe toxin diversification in venomous animalsby Daslav Hranueli and Antonio StarcevicToxicon : official journal of the International Society on Toxinology,  2015An important mechanism for the evolution of toxins in venomous animals is believed to be the acqu... more An important mechanism for the evolution of toxins in venomous animals is believed to be the acquisition of genes encoding proteins that switch from physiological to toxic roles following gene duplication. The &#39;reverse recruitment&#39; hypothesis pertains that these genes can also revert back to physiological functions, although such events are thought to be rare. A non-supervised homology searching method was developed which allowed the peptide diversity of animal toxins to be described as combinations between limited numbers of amino-acid sequence blocks we called &#39;tox-bits&#39;. Taking the phospholipase A2 (PLA2) protein family as an example, a Bernoulli Trial was used to test if &#39;tox-bits&#39; were robust enough to distinguish between peptides with physiological or toxin functions. The analysis revealed that discrimination was indeed possible, and supports the very recent &#39;restriction&#39; hypothesis whereby genes with the potential to encode toxic functions have...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Proteomics links the redox state to calcium signalling during bleaching of the scleractinian coral Acropora microphthalma on exposure to high solar irradiance and thermal stressby Daslav Hranueli, Antonio Starcevic, W.

During these treatments, corals had noticeably bleached. The photosynthetic performance of residual algal endosymbionts was severely impaired but showed signs of recovery in both treatments by the end of the second day. Changes in the coral proteome were determined daily and, using recently available annotated genome sequences, the individual contributions of the coral host and algal endosymbionts could be extracted from these data. Quantitative changes in proteins relevant to redox state and calcium metabolism are presented. Notably, expression of common antioxidant proteins was not detected from the coral host but present in the algal endosymbiont proteome. Possible roles for elevated carbonic anhydrase in the coral host are considered: to restor...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Databases of the thiotemplate modular systems (CSDB) and their in silico recombinants (r-CSDB)by Daslav Hranueli, Antonio Starcevic, Ranko Gacesa, and Janko DiminicJournal of Industrial Microbiology & Biotechnology,  2013Modular biosynthetic clusters are responsible for the synthesis of many important pharmaceutical ... more Modular biosynthetic clusters are responsible for the synthesis of many important pharmaceutical products. They include polyketide synthases (PKS clusters), non-ribosomal synthetases (NRPS clusters), and mixed clusters (containing both PKS and NRPS modules). The ClustScan database (CSDB) contains highly annotated descriptions of 170 clusters. The database has a hierarchical organization, which allows easy extraction of DNA and protein sequences of polypeptides, modules, and domains as well as an organization of the annotation so as to be able to predict the product chemistry to view it or export it in a standard SMILES format. The recombinant ClustScan database contains information about predicted recombinants between PKS clusters. The recombinants are generated by modeling homologous recombination and are associated with annotation and prediction of product chemistry automatically generated by the model. The database contains over 20,000 recombinants and is a resource for in silico approaches to detecting promising new compounds. Methods are available to construct the corresponding recombinants in the laboratory.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

A novel docking domain interface model predicting recombination between homoeologous modular biosynthetic gene clustersby Daslav Hranueli, Ana Vukelic, Janko Diminic, and Antonio StarcevicJournal of Industrial Microbiology & Biotechnology,  2011An in silico model for homoeologous recombination between gene clusters encoding modular polyketi... more An in silico model for homoeologous recombination between gene clusters encoding modular polyketide synthases (PKS) or non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) was developed. This model was used to analyze recombination between 12 PKS clusters from Streptomyces species and related genera to predict if new clusters might give rise to new products. In many cases, there were only a limited number of recombination sites (about 13 per cluster pair), suggesting that recombination may pose constraints on the evolution of PKS clusters. Most recombination events occurred between pairs of ketosynthase (KS) domains, allowing the biosynthetic outcome of the recombinant modules to be predicted. About 30% of recombinants were predicted to produce polyketides. Four NRPS clusters from Streptomyces strains were also used for in silico recombination. They yielded a comparable number of recombinants to PKS clusters, but the adenylation (A) domains contained the largest proportion of recombination events; this might be a mechanism for producing new substrate specificities. The extreme G + C-content, the presence of linear chromosomes and plasmids, as well as the lack of a mutSL-mismatch repair system should favor production of recombinants in Streptomyces species.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
