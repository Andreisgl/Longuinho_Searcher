Abstract
We investigate the drivers of the for-profit/not-for-profit wage differential by comparing judgments of job characteristics of workers who voluntarily or involuntarily moved from the former to the latter sector. We define voluntary movers as those who applied for a job in a not-for-profit organization and, when successful, resigned from a for-profit position, while involuntary movers have either been laid off by their company or resigned without already having a job offer in the not-for-profit sector. We observe that a large share of voluntary movers do not end up with higher wages but, surprisingly, do have higher job satisfaction after the change. The vast majority of voluntary movers find significantly higher time flexibility, improved relationships with stakeholders and closer conformity to educational skills in their new jobs. Our findings support the for-profit/not-for-profit compensating differential hypothesis and shed light on mechanisms that are beyond the job donation behavior of intrinsically motivated workers. 
1. Introduction
One of the main research dimensions on which current literature compares the for-profit and not-for-profit1 sectors is wage differentials. Among different theories trying to explain such differentials, the donative labor hypothesis (Hansmann, 1980; Preston, 1989; Frank, 1996; Rose-Ackerman, 1996) predicts that not-for-profit wages are relatively lower in exchange for higher nonpecuniary compensation. Intrinsic motivations (IMs) refer to motivations driven by interest or enjoyment in a task itself that originate inside a person, while extrinsic motivations derive from any external or outside (monetary) reward. Starting from the assumption of heterogeneity in workers’ characteristics, this strand of the literature argues that some people have greater IMs (Mirvis, 1992; Handy and Katz, 1998), are altruistic and more willing to pay for public goods (Leete, 2000) and accept lower wages in exchange for a stronger correlation between the goals of not-for-profit organizations and their moral motivations (Sen, 1985). As a result of this sorting and matching mechanism, the two sectors end up with different wages and heterogeneous sets of (more or less intrinsically motivated) workers (Borzaga and Depedri, 2005).From an empirical point of view, several studies investigating the for-profit/not-for-profit wage differential find evidence consistent with the donative labor hypothesis. Among them, Weisbrod (1983) observes a significant negative not-for-profit wage gap among lawyers working in the for-profit and not-for-profit industries. Similar results are found by Preston (1989) for different types of white-collar workers (managers, professionals, clerical, and sales workers). Evidence from Europe seems to trend in the same direction (Mosca et al., 2007, for Italy and Narcy, 2011, for France).However, in a thorough empirical analysis of the US Census data, Leete (2001) demonstrates that, when finer controls at the industry and occupation levels are introduced, the not-for-profit negative wage gap persists only in a few cases. To account for the puzzle, Leete (2001) comments that “the pattern of nonprofit wage differentials across disaggregated occupations and industries is suggestive of a number of forces affecting nonprofit wages simultaneously” (p. 138).The main problem highlighted by this literature is that the for-profit/not-for-profit wage differential may be determined by many other factors, ranging from job amenities2 and disamenities3 to better matching between workers and job characteristics4 (i.e. productivity differentials between the two sectors, a mismatch between industry-specific vacancies and workers’ skills, etc.). As a consequence, the empirical literature cannot disentangle the role of different factors that contribute to the determination of the for-profit/not-for-profit wage differential.5To understand our reasoning from a dynamic perspective, consider that an existing wage differential between the for-profit and not-for-profit industry in the presence of job vacancies in the for-profit industry (and absence of productivity differentials) should be bridged by a migration of workers from the latter to the former sector. One explanation for why this may not occur is that higher utility due to job characteristics (or to the favorable matching of jobs and workers’ characteristics) in the not-for-profit industry can compensate for the wage difference.6The argument developed in this article is that we can instead disentangle the specific roles of relative amenities and disamenities in the two different sectors by (i) inspecting relative preferences and comparative judgments of working conditions of voluntary and involuntary movers from the for-profit to the not-for-profit industry and (ii) identifying (and analyzing the characteristics of) a smaller group of voluntary movers who in the change end up with a lower (or equivalent) wage and higher life satisfaction. In essence, while standard empirical analysis of the for-profit/not-for-profit wage differential is based on between effects (differences in wages between two heterogeneous groups of employees working in the two different sectors), we work on within effects by looking at changes in wages and job satisfaction (on specific features) of the same individuals voluntarily or involuntary moving from the for-profit to the not-for-profit industry.To perform our empirical analysis, we therefore identify three groups. The first includes individuals who were laid off in the for-profit sector and found a new job in the not-for-profit sector. We refer to these individuals as laid off involuntary movers (LOIMs). The second group includes individuals who resigned from their job in the for-profit industry without already having a job (or the idea of pursuing a job) in the not-for-profit industry. We call them resigned involuntary movers (RIMs).7 The third group is composed of workers who voluntarily left the for-profit sector for a job in the not-for-profit industry (voluntary movers or VMs) (for further details on the definition of the three groups, see section 4). Within this third group of VMs, we further identify a fourth group made up of the subset of VMs who register higher job satisfaction in spite of a lower (or equivalent) wage. We refer to these final individuals as nonwage motivated voluntary movers (NWMVMs); we focus on these latter workers to investigate whether compensating nonpecuniary characteristics and/or greater IMs may explain this paradox.We deem important to introduce the distinction between voluntary and involuntary movers because we assume that a positive argument in the utility function related to IMs (or job amenities) is more convincingly supported if individuals move voluntarily from the for-profit to the not-for-profit sector, identifying higher job satisfaction although they earn a lower wage.In VMs, there must be a factor (IM or job amenities) that more than compensates for the negative wage effect to produce both the decision to move and the positive change in satisfaction. In such cases, we have the additional element of the choice (represented by the voluntary move from the for-profit to the not-for-profit sector), that is, a “revealed preference” check that is consistent and reinforces reported higher job satisfaction, making the subjective evidence more convincing and robust. In addition, consider that, in the case of involuntary movers, the improved job satisfaction may also be determined by the stress/disappointment of the layoff experience (for LOIMs) or a period of unemployment after resigning (for RIMs); this is not the case for VMs.This article is divided into six sections (including the introduction and conclusion). The second section sketches the model behind our empirical tests. The third section describes the data set, while the fourth and fifth sections provide descriptive and econometric findings, respectively. The sixth section concludes. 2. The model
Consider an economy populated by workers (indexed with i) and job locations (indexed with j) where the workers’ utility function is Ui = f(Ci, Ri, JAj, JDj, SIMij), depending on consumption (Ci), recreational leisure (Ri), amenities and disamenities of the workers’ jobs (JAj and JDj, respectively), and workers’ satisfaction of (other regarding and self-regarding) IMs (SIMij).8 The labor demand is standard: Ldi = h(w, MPL) and is a function of wages (w) and the marginal productivity of labor (MPL). Workers face a standard constraint  where  is the total number of hours that can be worked in a day and  is nonlabor income. By solving the constrained maximization problem, we obtain labor supply as a function of prices, wages, job amenities and disamenities, and the individual specific weight of IMs in the utility function: Lsi = k (P, w, JAj, JDj, IMij).Imagine two types of workers with either low or high IM (i = L, H) and two types of job locations in for-profit and not-for-profit industries (j = π, nπ). To justify an initial wage differential in favor of the for-profit industry, assume that productivity is higher in the for-profit industry: Yπ = h(AL,K) > Ynπ = h(L,K), with A being a labor augmenting component that is present in the for-profit but not in the not-for-profit industry. In contrast, assume that working in the not-for-profit sector allows the enjoyment of better job amenities (e.g. time flexibility, relationship with colleagues, and involvement) and lesser job disamenities (e.g. control); more formally, JAπ<JAnπ and JDπ > JDnπ.9If we assume as well that the not-for-profit industry reduces the gap between workers’ ideals and corporate goals (IMπ < IMnπ), we obtain a leftward shift in the supply of labor in the not-for-profit industry and a higher wage differential in equilibrium. In equilibrium, (Wπ - Wnπ) = f(A, IMij, JAj, JDj) so that the wage differential between the for-profit and not-for-profit industries depends on the labor augmenting component, IMs, and the job amenities and disamenities.Consider now a situation of full employment in both industries with some workers whose satisfaction of IMs in their specific job (SIMij) is such that Ui = f(Ci,Ri (wπ),JAπ,JDπ, SIMiπ) < Ui = f(Ci,Ri (wnπ),JAnπ,JDnπ, SIMinπ) even though wπ > wnπ.10 If new job opportunities were opened in the not-for-profit industries, such workers would move from the for-profit to the not-for-profit industry, be happier as a result of the change, and be characterized by a high level of satisfaction of IMs.Our empirical analysis will begin by analyzing comparative evaluations of past and new jobs for involuntary and VMs from the for-profit to the not-for-profit industry. We will follow with a direct test on the conclusion of this simple theoretical example. The null hypothesis will be that higher satisfaction of IMs in the new job raises the possibility that a worker voluntarily moves from the for-profit to the not-for-profit industry with a lower (or equivalent) wage and higher job satisfaction. 3. Object of inquiry and available data
In section 3.1, we describe the object of our inquiry (social cooperatives) and how it relates to the for-profit and to the rest of the not-for-profit sector. In section 3.2, we provide details regarding data construction. 3.1 The Italian social enterprises
In Italy, not-for-profit organizations producing goods and social services mainly choose the cooperative legal form of ownership. Italian cooperatives differ from for-profit firms because the former do not have a profit-maximizing goal but rather a statutory goal of creating benefits not in the prevailing form of profits for some of their stakeholders.11 In the cooperative family, social cooperatives (cooperative sociali) are a recently born legal form, delivering social services or providing work integration to disadvantaged people.12 Specifically, the Italian law 381/1991 establishes that the goal of social cooperatives is “pursuing the general interest of the community in promoting personal growth and in integrating people into society by providing social, welfare and educational services and carrying out different activities for the purposes of providing employment for disadvantaged people.” Social cooperatives can be of type A when they manage health care and education services, or of type B (also called work integration social enterprises) when they operate in industry, agriculture, trade, or service sectors with the goal of inclusion of “disadvantaged” workers (at least 30% of the workforce must be composed of disabled persons, ex prisoners, ex drug addicts, etc.).With regard to the destination of the economic value created, Italian cooperatives are obliged by law to allocate at least 30% of their net surpluses to indivisible reserves of capital (riserva legale).13 After satisfying this obligation they can, but need not, distribute only a limited part of their surpluses in the form of either remuneration and reevaluation of members’ capital shares or in return for members’ contributions (ristorni).14 The usual practice for cooperatives is to reinvest all the realized net surpluses in indivisible reserves (asset locks). For these reasons, Italian cooperatives are for all intents not-for-profit firms with productive or entrepreneurial nature.In its past (2008) Census of Social Cooperatives, the Italian Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) reports that in December 2005 there were 7363 active institutions, 244,223 employees and managers, and 34,626 volunteers providing goods and services for €6.4 billion to more than 3,300,000 people. The vast majority of social enterprises were created after 1991: in only 2 years, between 2003 and 2005, the number of firms, workers, and the value of goods and services produced increased by 20%–30% (net of inflation).Looking at the national census data, social cooperatives are only a small part of Italian not-for-profit organizations (see ISTAT, 2001; Zamagni, 2011). At the beginning of the new century, Italy had more than 200,000 not-for-profit organizations producing approximately 5% of the GDP and offering jobs to 750,000 people. The not-for-profit organizations also provided 3.3 million people with work as volunteers. Approximately 63.4% of these institutions are involved in culture, sports, and recreation, 8.7% in social assistance, 7.1% in labor union and lobbying activities, 5.3% in education, 4.4% in health care, and the remaining share in a number of other sectors (social, religious, international cooperation, etc.).The relevance of social cooperatives has increased significantly over the past years; the Chamber of Commerce documents the presence in 2008 of approximately 14,000 social cooperatives, employing more than 317 000 remunerated employees.To better quantify the relevance of the sector, we must also consider other data. First, the impact of social cooperatives on the economy as a whole is obviously quite low: they only represent 2.3% of Italian firms and employ approximately 1.7% of the total paid workforce. Nonetheless, when moving to the analysis of the social services sector, data show that, in 2005, almost half of the social spending of medium- and large-sized Italian towns was managed by social cooperatives and other not-for-profit organizations, and approximately 80% of contracts were awarded by local authorities to social cooperatives (Laratta et al., 2010). Data change significantly when analyzing the not-for-profit sector as a whole. The most recent investigations (Venturi and Zandonai, 2012) estimated the number of productive not-for-profit organizations (or social enterprises) in 2011 in more than 35,000 institutions. Moreover, the role of social cooperatives is demonstrated to have been increasing during the crisis: the number of people employed in social cooperatives increased by 17.8% in the period 2006–2011, while the total employment in Italy declined by 1.2% (Censis, 2012).The national census does not allow a comparison of the characteristics of social cooperatives with those of for-profit organizations. Nonetheless, a national investigation carried out in 1998 on a sample of Italian organizations producing social services provides a comparative analysis of some job amenities and human resource management practices in homogeneous sectors of activity. The investigation shows that for-profit firms pay higher average hourly wages to their part-time workers, while the total net wage of full-time workers is higher on average than in social cooperatives. For-profit organizations more often tend to supply open-ended contracts (85% in comparison with 76% in social cooperatives) and full-time contracts (85%–74%). Job flexibility is nonetheless higher in social cooperatives, considering the opportunity both for most of employees to ask for permissions and leaves and to provide unpaid overtime. Among other job characteristics, it is possible to note the greater involvement of social cooperative employees in the decision-making process, the less centralized and vertical relationships with superiors, and the higher distributive and procedural fairness perceived (Tortia, 2008).The national survey on employment in Italy in 2005 (the same year in which our investigation was carried out) shows that the average net wage of all dependent employees amounted to 1312 Euros per month; it decreased to 1280 only when private enterprises were considered (ISTAT, 2011). The average wage of Italian employees is therefore significantly greater than the salary revealed among employees interviewed in social cooperatives. The ISTAT census of the labor force in 2005 (ISTAT, 2008) shows that the employment of young people less than 35 years was approximately 31.1%, as opposed to 41.7% in social cooperatives; females represented 39.5% of the total employees but 79.6% in social cooperatives; 86% of Italian people are employed with open-ended contracts (81% in social cooperatives); part-time workers are only 14.7% of the total workforce but 44% in social cooperatives; only 21% of employees participated in training activities in recent years, as opposed to more than 60% in social cooperatives. More recently, although data are not official, the situation has come to be characterized by a higher presence of temporary contracts in for-profit firms and a high usage of part-time contracts in social cooperatives (approximately 50%). Average wages continue to be higher in for-profit firms than in social cooperatives, although they significantly vary when moving from one sector of activity to another. 3.2 The database
In 2006, six Italian universities15 jointly created a data set (ICSI 2007) by submitting questionnaires to a representative sample of 4134 employees and 338 managers of 320 Italian cooperatives. The 84 questions contained in the survey range from sociodemographic controls (age, gender, education, etc.) to job characteristics (wage, tasks, working hours, overtime) and job satisfaction with respect to a number of possible domains (with colleagues, wage, type of job). Question types include both closed format questions and Likert questions with evaluative psychological meaning.The sample of institutions was extracted from the ISTAT (Italian National Agency for Statistics) 2003 census of social enterprises, recording 6168 active cooperatives (with at least one employee) at the national level (Carpita, 2009). The initial sample was stratified by cooperative type (type A and type B), province (107 spread over 20 regions), and firm size (small, medium, and large firms)16. In principle, the final sample should have included 411 organizations. However, among them, 186 organizations (45.3% of the total) agreed to participate in the study, 164 (39.9% of the sample) did not agree, and 61 organizations (14.8%) were not available because they were closed, had transformed into different organizational types, or had changed address. The decision not to participate was justified by the cooperatives’ lack of time and resources to coordinate data collection, given the tight budget social faced, and was also randomly determined by the presence of imminent deadlines. Therefore, we expect the nonresponse bias to be negligible. In small firms (less than 15 employees), all workers were interviewed, while in medium (15–50 employees) and large (more than 50 employees) firms a sample of potential respondents was randomly extracted. In all, 2883 questionnaires were administered to employees in the 186 organizations that agreed to participate. Because of nonresponses,17 2419 questionnaires were finally compiled from the selected respondents.To compensate for nonresponses, 134 organizations were added to the initial sample. Such organizations were chosen through personal contacts on the basis of the affinity with the nonparticipating cooperatives. The same methodology was adopted when extracting the sample of paid employees in each organization. Therefore, the final sample available for empirical analysis, which hereafter will be named ICSI 2007, is made of 320 organizations and 4134 questionnaires completed by paid employees.18 Surveys were completed either in groups at the workplace with the support of data collectors, or at home. In both cases, questionnaires were returned to collectors in anonymous envelopes. To maximize the number of questionnaires collected, collectors met with each organization several times and asked organizations to collect late spare questionnaires and to mail them to the surveyors. 4. Descriptive findings and empirical strategy
To proceed with our analysis, as mentioned in the introduction, we classify workers who declared that their previous job was in the for-profit sector into LOIMs, RIMs, and VMs based on the following survey question (see the Supplementary Appendix): Q45. You changed your last job because: i) you were fired; ii) your contract expired; iii) you resigned even though you did not have any other job prospects; iv) you resigned because you were offered your current position by the Cooperative; v) Others (Please, specify). with VM being those answering positively to question 45.iv, RIM to 45.iii and LOIM to questions 45.i and 45.ii.To clarify the implicit and explicit assumptions behind our strategy based on comparisons of different types of between-sector movers, we illustrate our point in the table below.Imagine as we do in the table that a job amenity (JA; i.e. significant difference in time flexibility) exists between the not-for-profit and the for-profit sector. Considering only transitions between and within the two (for-profit and not-for-profit) sectors, we have the following four possibilities:  
 
            . Individual A
            . Individual B
            . Individual C
            . Individual D
            . Previous job Not-for-profit (high flexibility) For-profit (low flexibility) For-profit (low flexibility) Not-for-profit (high flexibility) Current job Not-for-profit (high flexibility) Not-for-profit (high flexibility) For-profit (low flexibility) For-profit (low flexibility) 
            . Individual A
            . Individual B
            . Individual C
            . Individual D
            . Previous job Not-for-profit (high flexibility) For-profit (low flexibility) For-profit (low flexibility) Not-for-profit (high flexibility) Current job Not-for-profit (high flexibility) Not-for-profit (high flexibility) For-profit (low flexibility) For-profit (low flexibility)

            . Previous job Not-for-profit (high flexibility) For-profit (low flexibility) For-profit (low flexibility) Not-for-profit (high flexibility) Current job Not-for-profit (high flexibility) Not-for-profit (high flexibility) For-profit (low flexibility) For-profit (low flexibility)

          Open in new tab
        Such differences can be detected either by comparing individuals A and B (as we do) or by comparing B and C or C and D.Our database contains information only on current workers in the not-for-profit sector. We therefore have only A and B types; we use this information the best we can to detect the effect under some reasonable conditions. Note, in fact, that our comparisons imply that a fourth group of individuals we cannot observe (group D) does not register an offsetting change (i.e. a move from a low flexibility not-for-profit job to a high flexibility for-profit job), which may make our observed findings misleading when interpreted in terms of differences between the two sectors. Note as well that the group of those who are currently at their first job is automatically excluded from the sample when we look at differences between new and old jobs because it does not respond to the relative comparison question (Q47).Finally, even if we dispose of the available information, we decide not to compare similar types of movers, e.g. voluntary between-sector movers (from for-profit to not-for-profit) with voluntary within-sector movers (between two not-for-profit) because we would introduce an additional source of variability in our comparisons. In fact, the differences in relative evaluations between the two groups would depend not just on the difference between the former for-profit job and the current not-for-profit (for voluntary between-sector movers) but also on the difference between a former and a current not-for-profit (for voluntary within sector movers), with a high likelihood of a significant job improvement within the not-for-profit industry behind a voluntary within-sector move. This would introduce a unidirectional element of variability in our “control sample,” which we want to have as neutral as possible. Our goal is to compare the quality in the two sectors with the average quality change of those who move, for whatever reasons, from one job to another in the same sector without a job quality improvement. Being unspecified (as it is, for example, in Table 4), the group of within not-for-profit sector movers therefore includes those moving from a better to a worse job and those moving from a worse to a better job. 4.1 Descriptive statistics on the whole sample and the three categories of VMs, RIMs, and LOIMs
Table 1 provides a description of the variables used while Table 2 summarizes statistics of the full sample. Table 2 shows that interviewed social cooperative workers are relatively young (37 years old on average), a large proportion are females (74%)19 and members of the cooperative (76%). The majority of workers conceive their jobs not just as a “mere contractual relationship where a job is exchanged for pay” but as additional motivations related to personal formation, quality of relationships, and a common social consent with the cooperative.A first important question is about the magnitude of our three groups of movers in the overall sample. The subsample of social cooperative workers who were previously employed in the for-profit industry is composed of 1442 individuals (i.e., 34.69% of the total sample). Among them, 419 are VMs (10.08% of the total sample), while 423 are laid off and 521 are resigned movers (10.18% and 12.73%, respectively). Note that the sum of the three groups does not exactly coincide with the total number of workers who moved from one industry to another because a small residual group stated to have moved for other nonspecified reasons. Table 3 shows that demographic characteristics of the four considered groups of movers are quite similar, even though the share of males is quite higher among voluntary than involuntary movers.

        In the rest of our descriptive and econometric analysis, we will often compare values for these three groups of shifters from the for-profit to the not-for-profit industry with the benchmark of another group of workers (defined as the rest of the sample), which is represented by individuals who change from a previous to a current job within the same not-for-profit sector (while workers who come from unemployment or inactivity are obviously excluded from the analysis that follows). Consider that, under reasonable assumptions, when evaluating comparative differences between the two industries, it is exactly the same if the benchmark is made by individuals with previous and new jobs in the not-for-profit industry or individuals with previous and new jobs in the for-profit industry.20When we look at Table 4’s wage differentials in the three categories, we find that more than one third of workers end up with a wage that is not higher than in their previous job.21 This occurs for 33% of VMs, 44% of RIMs, and 37% of LOIMs. If we consider that moving from one job to another entails some transaction costs, then nonpecuniary motivations and/or IMs must explain why 33% of VMs have opted as they did.22

          Open in new tab
        We therefore investigate in Table 4 the comparative evaluations of previous and current jobs of voluntary and involuntary movers. The demands under scrutiny (respectively 47 and 48 in the questionnaire) are the following: Q47: In comparison to your previous job, how has your employment situation changed with respect to: i) your economic situation; ii) consistency with your education; iii) responsibilities; iv) flexibility of working time; v) career prospects; vi) employment stability; vii) your involvement in decision making; viii) your relationships with colleagues; ix) relationships with superiors; x) possibility of creating new relationships (with stakeholders).Q48: In comparison to your previous job, how has your overall job satisfaction changed?Answers are given on a 1–7 Likert scale from much worse (1) to much better (7) with 4 indicating equal conditions between the previous and new jobs. A general consideration is that for all groups an improvement on the different modalities is registered for the majority of movers (including involuntary ones). Looking in more detail at the descriptive findings on this question, we find that the majority of movers (especially voluntary ones) from for-profit to not-for-profit industries find more consistency with their education as a result of the job change. More specifically, this result is found for 71% of VMs, 63% of resigned, and 60% of laid-off involuntary movers (Table 4).Differences in terms of job responsibility on the job do not seem to be too great, but, again, VMs register a positive difference between new and past jobs in a higher proportion than the rest of the sample. The difference between the three categories of movers and the rest of the sample is strong in terms of time flexibility, with the latter being higher in the new not-for-profit occupation. It is not surprising to see that 88% of VMs increase their job satisfaction with the change; however, the share of (resigned or laid off) involuntary movers finding higher job satisfaction in the new not-for-profit job is also far above average (81 and 78%, respectively). Last, but not least, note that the four groups of movers from the for-profit to the not-for-profit sector report a higher share of relative improvement with respect to movers from a not-for-profit to another not-for-profit job in terms of all items except employment stability and career prospects. 4.2 Descriptive statistics on nonwage motivated VMs
Beyond these general statistics of the three groups, we are particularly interested in the subgroup of NWMVMs, that is, individuals who moved voluntarily from the for-profit to the not-for-profit industry finding lower (or equivalent) wages and higher job satisfaction.23 If we consider that the transaction costs of changing jobs must be nonzero, the increase in job satisfaction cannot be generated by pecuniary factors. This group is not small: it amounts to approximately 43% of all VMs, for 179 individuals. To check which nonpecuniary compensating differentials may more than offset the nonpositive wage change in terms of work satisfaction, we use information from question 47 described in the previous section (see data in Table 4).The only two domains in which there is no improvement for the majority of NWMVMs are career perspectives (43%) and job stability (39%),24 that is, the two motivations that can be more easily linked with pecuniary variables (both of them affect the future expected stream of wages if not the current wage; see Table 4). All other dimensions register an improvement for the majority of NWMVMs. In a new job, there is greater consistence with one’s own education (69% of respondents), greater responsibilities (68%), more time flexibility (71%), more involvement in decision-making (64%), improved relationships with colleagues (66%) and with superiors (67%), and greater opportunities for creating new relationships with stakeholders (80%). 5. Econometric findings
In our econometric analysis, we aim to test whether being a member of one of the three groups of movers from the for-profit to the not-for-profit industry affects the comparative evaluation of characteristics of the old and new job. We therefore estimate the following ordered probit specification: (1) where the dependent variable of the comparative evaluation of the new versus the old job (ΔY) is regressed on a set of controls including the current wage level (Wage), a gender dummy (Male), respondent’s age (Age), education years (Education), a dummy for Italian nationality (Italian), a dummy that takes a value of one if the respondent is also a member of the cooperative (Member), the number of years of work in the cooperative (Yearsincoop), two dummies for permanent and full-time job status (Permanent and Fulltime, respectively, the benchmark being temporary and part-time), two dummies for medium and large size (Medium and Large), a dummy that takes a value of one if the respondent works in the A-type cooperative (Type-A) and three macro-area dummies (NorthEast, NorthWest, and Center). Finally, CoopSocPop is the number of social cooperatives per worker at the province level while LOIM, RIM, and VM are the dummies representing the three groups of movers (respectively, laid off involuntary, resigned involuntary, and voluntary). As specified in section 4, the benchmark in this analysis is the group of individuals whose previous and current jobs are in the not-for-profit industry. Errors are clustered at the cooperative level to take into account that heterogeneity within the same cooperative is expected to be lower than between cooperatives. All regressions include dummy variables for the sector of activity (results are omitted for reasons of space but are available upon request from the authors).25 5.1 Determinants of workers’ opinion about new versus old jobs
Among the most important econometric results, we find that being a voluntary, resigned involuntary, or LOIM is associated, respectively, with a 7, 12, and 11% higher probability of experiencing a wage reduction (Table 5, column i). We also find that being a VM from the for-profit to the not-for-profit industry raises by 19% the probability of reporting higher consistency with education in the new job (Table 5, column ii).26 The effect is 12% for LOIMs and 9% for RIMs. Another strong effect is in the relative comparison of work-time flexibility (Table 5, column iv). Being a VM raises by 7% and being laid off or a RIM by 11% the probability of increasing work time flexibility as a result of the job change (Table 5, column iv). Being VMs or RIMs raises the probability of reporting improved relationships in the new job, but this is not the case for laid off involuntary workers (Table 5a, column x).

In detail, they are: (i) Worse wage; (ii) Better consistency with one’s own education; (iii) More responsibility in the job; (iv) Improved time flexibility; (v) Improved career perspectives; (vi) Improved job stability; (vii) More involvement in decision-making; (viii) Better relations with colleagues; (ix) Better relations with superiors; (x) Better relations with stakeholders; (xi) Higher job satisfaction. The analysis makes use of ordered probit regressions with standard errors adjusted for clusters at the cooperative level and includes dummy variables for the sector of activity (not shown but available upon request). Standard errors clustered at the cooperative level are reported in parentheses: ***P < 0.01, **P < 0.05, *P < 0.1.

In detail, they are: (i) Worse wage; (ii) Better consistency with one’s own education; (iii) More responsibility in the job; (iv) Improved time flexibility; (v) Improved career perspectives; (vi) Improved job stability; (vii) More involvement in decision-making; (viii) Better relations with colleagues; (ix) Better relations with superiors; (x) Better relations with stakeholders; (xi) Higher job satisfaction. The analysis makes use of ordered probit regressions with standard errors adjusted for clusters at the cooperative level and includes dummy variables for the sector of activity (not shown but available upon request). Standard errors clustered at the cooperative level are reported in parentheses: ***P < 0.01, **P < 0.05, *P < 0.1.

        A final important finding is that being a member of the two groups of voluntary and RIMs significantly affects the probability of being happier as a result of the job change (Table 5, column xi). The effect is 10% for VMs and 5% for RIMs. Finally, note that the significance of the wage level among the controls shows that comparative evaluations of pecuniary job characteristics are indeed affected by the level of wage. However, their significance persists even after we correct for it. 5.2 Robustness check: gender and seniority splits
We perform a robustness check of our Table 5 regressions by splitting the sample around the median number of years in the current job (while maintaining the Yearincoop variable in the estimates). We observe an interesting “honeymoon effect” because the pattern of positive and significant comparisons between the current and the previous jobs for movers from the for-profit to the not-for-profit sector is more pronounced for workers with lesser seniority (Table 6). VMs with seniority below the median in the new not-for-profit job register five significantly improved characteristics (better consistency with one’s own education; more responsibility on the job; improved flexibility; better relations with stakeholders; higher job satisfaction) against only two for VMs with seniority above the median (better consistency with one’s own education and higher job satisfaction).27 The contrast is even sharper for the other two groups. RIMs who register significant positive effects in nine domains when below the median of seniority, while in only one domain when above the median of seniority. The results are similar for involuntary movers who register nine positive effects below the median of seniority and only one (time flexibility) above the median of seniority. This shows that VMs persist more in their positive evaluations. This result is consistent with our considerations in the introduction that between sector comparisons of VMs are to be considered more reliable because they are confirmed by “revealed choices” and not affected by layoffs or periods of unemployment. As a partial caveat to the above-mentioned interpretation of our robustness findings, consider that our cross-sectional data make it impossible to disentangle seniority from the “cohort” effect (in this case, the year of mobility effect, which may capture year-specific business cycle effects on the labor market).

Splits by seniority are as follows: more recent are those whose seniority is below the median, less recent are those above.

        These findings are not contradictory with respect to the often positive impact of years of seniority (even in the above seniority split), which captures the selection and survivorship effects on the more motivated individuals who remain on the job and report a significant and positive difference with respect to the previous job in the for-profit sector.In a further robustness check, we estimate regressions from Table 5 separately by gender. We find that our results are in general stronger for females, who have a higher number of significant positive effects. As expected, the superior time flexibility in the current not-for-profit job is an attribute signalled much more by females than males. Note, however, that our main result (comparative evaluation of higher job satisfaction for VMs from the for-profit to the not-for-profit sector) is remarkably stable across the gender split. Note as well that males account for only one third of the sample; this is consistent with the prevalence of female workers in the universe of social cooperative workers. 5.3 Econometric findings of nonwage motivated VMs
To identify characteristics of nonwage motivated VMs (the subgroup of VMs who increased job satisfaction without moving to higher wages as a result of the change), we estimate the following probit model (see Table 9): (2) where the dependent variable takes a value of 1 if the individual is a NWMVM and zero otherwise.28 Because we want to verify whether greater IMs are positively correlated with the NWMVM status among movers from the for-profit to the not-for-profit sector, we exclude from the regression all other movers (that is, individuals with previous and current jobs in the not-for-profit industry). Equation regressors, specified as in (2), are similar to those in (1) with the addition of the PCIMJA variable, which is a principal component of the variables measuring IMs and job amenities as specified below (see Tables 7 and 8). The inclusion of the IM variable stems from the consideration that differences in IMs may be an important explanation of for-profit/not-for-profit compensating wage differentials under the assumption that not-for-profit firms, as a result of the specific nature of their activities, may better satisfy IMs.

        To understand the distinction between IMs and job amenities, we begin with the original Deci (1975) definition, which defines IM in the following manner: “One is said to be intrinsically motivated to perform an activity when he receives no apparent reward except the activity itself.” We also consider that, to individuate the specific items that describe the different facets of the IM, Ben-Ner and Putterman (1998) observe that IMs can imply both self-regarding preferences, as in the case of professional growth, and other-regarding preferences, as in the case of attention paid to the needs of the community.Based on these theoretical premises, we argue that IMs concern a specific individual disposition, which leads a person to be satisfied by his activity regardless of its monetary reward. In this respect, they are different from job amenities/disamenities that are related to objective characteristics of a job.Of course, the two factors interact because some of the objective characteristics of a job (some of the job amenities) may trigger IMs (such as, in our case, better consistency with one’s own education or more responsibilities). This is why we estimate the two variables first with a joint factor (PCIMJA) and then with two separated components (PCIM and PCJA).The first question we analyze to measure the two variables is question 8, in which respondents are asked to provide their degree of consensus (on a 1–7 Likert scale) with the following items describing their job relationship with the cooperative: a mere contractual relationship where a job is exchanged for pay (Q8.1);a contribution which helps the cooperative to reach its goals (Q8.2);a mix between a job and growth in personal formation (Q8.3);a set of relationships that goes beyond the mere job relation (Q8.4);a social engagement common to the respondent and the cooperative (Q8.5).The question clearly relates to job amenities/disamenities (which make the job stimulating or socially relevant), which may also trigger and be related to IMs.Our assumption is that high agreement with the first item (Q8.1) is negatively correlated, while agreement with the other definitions (Q8.2 to Q8.5) is positively correlated, with IMs. Deeper scrutiny of the five statements reveals that Q8.3 concerns self-regarding, while Q8.2, and especially Q8.5, concern other-regarding IMs. This is because agreement with statements Q8.2 to Q8.5 implies that workers find in their job a source of satisfaction (formation, identification in cooperative goals, community and relational elements in the job, social engagement) that goes beyond mere remuneration.The other question we analyze is question 52, asking whether, before finding the current job in the cooperative, the respondent was looking for the following: a job promoting his self-fulfilment (Q52.3); orallowing him/her to be helpful to other people (Q52.2).This question identifies two dispositions/desires, which signal self-regarding and other-regarding IMs. The first is the desire to promote one’s own self-fulfilment (Q52-3). The second is the desire to be helpful to other people (Q52-2).29 If an activity allows an individual to satisfy such motivations, the activity may be rewarding in itself. The advantage of these two items is that they refer to a disposition of the respondent before finding the current job and therefore are not related to amenities/disamenities of the current job.To calculate the PCIMJA joint factor, we use the first principal component of the 5 + 2 items above because these items (especially those from question Q8) are strictly correlated30 and each of them captures only a specific facet of the problem. As a consequence, it is advisable to transform the larger number of correlated variables into a smaller number of uncorrelated ones, revealing the internal structure of the data in a way that best explains its variability.We therefore apply principal component analysis to the vector of the seven considered proxies. Table 7 shows the relevance of the first component, which captures 39% of the variability. This component is negatively correlated with the first item and positively correlated with all the others, with correlation coefficients that never fall below 26% (see Table 8). The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of sampling adequacy (0.76) excludes the possibility that the selected variables have too little in common to warrant a factor analysis.Estimated findings show that male gender and location in North-East, North-West, or Center positively affects the likelihood of being a NWMVM (Table 9, column i).31 The effect of the inclusion of the first principal component of IMs and job amenities in the regression for the determinants of the NWMVM choice is positive and significant. This implies that the change from the for-profit to the not-for-profit industry is positively correlated with IMs or that the latter increases the likelihood of being part of the NWMVM group. Our findings do not contradict previous results from Becchetti et al. (2012), considering the nexus between wages and IMs within the not-for-profit cooperative sector (without reference to their past job location, whether in the profit or in the not-for-profit sector) and finding that IMs correlate not only with higher effort and relatively higher wages within the not-for-profit sector but also to some forms of job donations in terms of unpaid overtime. If we put together those results with our own, we may infer that all workers moving from the for-profit to the not-for-profit sector earn a negative wage differential but those who are intrinsically motivated have a relatively higher wage within the not-for-profit sector and (due to their IM) are also more likely to report higher job satisfaction even though they experience the negative wage differential. Note as well that VMs who are relatively more intrinsically motivated (as shown in Table 9) are also those with a relatively lower probability of reporting a lower wage than the other two groups of involuntary movers (7% against 12% and 11%, Table 5, column i), which is consistent with the interpretation provided above.The result can also be interpreted as showing that NWMVMs have significantly greater IMs than other movers. If we assume that the not-for-profit sector is more able to satisfy the type of IMs indicated in section 5.1, these findings explain why, when moving to a job that does not offer a higher wage, this specific group of workers ends up being happier than before: irrespective of the voluntary or involuntary cause of the job change, greater IMs are more likely to lead to a situation in which lower (or equivalent) wages may be associated with higher job satisfaction. Our evidence is based on self-reported information and therefore may be affected by self-reporting bias. Consider, however, that this is a problem in all empirical literature based on survey data and that there are no particular reasons to assume that self-reporting bias is correlated with IMs.A problem with this estimate, however, is that the dependent variable is zero also for individuals who ended up with higher wages after the change. To improve the accuracy of the estimate, we limit the control sample only to (voluntary and involuntary) changers who ended up with lower (or equivalent) wages (Table 9, column ii). As a further robustness check, we restrict the sample to only VMs who ended up with lower (or equivalent) wages [excluding individuals from the other two groups of involuntary movers ending up with lower (or equivalent) wages, see Table 9, column iii]. Again, the variable of IMs is strongly significant even though the number of observations is now limited to 115 individuals.Among other controls, the statistical significance of the wage variable in columns ii and iv shows that nonwage motivated movers tend to have slightly higher wages (the magnitude of the impact is negligible). Overall, this implies that, while meeting the condition of a wage not higher than in the previous for-profit job, the latter may nonetheless have better wage conditions than the rest of the movers (which includes involuntary movers, as well). Rationales for this finding may also relate to the IM-wage nexus in the not-for-profit industry discussed in footnote 30. Note as well that the significance disappears or weakens when we limit the sample to VMs only (columns iii and vi). In that case, the wage level seems not to affect the probability of reporting higher job satisfaction in spite of the wage reduction vis-à-vis the previous for-profit job.Our second step consists of separating the two factors (IM and job amenities/disamenities) into two different variables (PCIM and PCJA), using in the first case the principal component based on only items from question 8 and, in the second case, the principal component using only items from question 52.32 In the first estimate without filters (corresponding to the estimate of column i of Table 9 with the PCIMJA variable), we find that both principal components are not significant (Table 9, column iv). In the two filtered estimates (corresponding to the estimates of columns ii and iii with the PCIMJA variable), we find that the IM component is strongly significant, while the job amenities component is significant only in column v.Our conclusion is that, beyond the aggregate significance of the joint PCIMJA factor, the subjective IM component is the most important driver producing the paradox of a positive change in job satisfaction in spite of a wage drop. With reference to the theoretical framework outlined in section 2, this implies that the IMs argument in the utility function has greater weight than the JA argument. 6. Conclusions
The literature on wage differentials measures the effect of pecuniary and nonpecuniary job characteristics on workers’ utility by analyzing determinants of wage differentials through the lenses of labor market theories. In this perspective, in nonsegmented labor markets and in the presence of job vacancies in the not-for-profit sector, we may find the paradox of individuals moving from the for-profit to the not-for-profit sector even in the presence of negative wage differentials and nonetheless reporting higher job satisfaction, if nonpecuniary compensating differentials offset the negative difference in remuneration. The presence of IMs may deepen the wage differential if not-for-profit jobs more easily satisfy IMs than for-profit jobs. Our findings confirm that the compensating differential hypothesis is part of the explanation of the for-profit/not-for-profit wage differentials because we identify a group of VMs who change jobs for a lower (or equivalent) wage and experience higher job satisfaction after the change.The inquiry regarding the characteristics and relative preferences of this group of workers helps us to identify what compensates them. We find that the group is relatively more intrinsically motivated than the rest of the movers and the majority of the group identifies a series of nonpecuniary compensations (improvement in time flexibility, more consistency with one’s own education, better relationships with stakeholders) when comparing the new and old jobs.A limitation of our database is that it has no longitudinal data and does not record information on household wealth. To our knowledge, there are no existing data sets containing such information along with the quality of evidence we have on for-profit/not-for-profit changes and comparative evaluations of satisfaction about two jobs in various domains. Once this information is available, it will be interesting to analyze how household wealth may affect the decision to change jobs and the same comparative evaluations between the two working environments.As a final caveat, it must be considered that evidence on flows that is consistent with the donative labor hypothesis does not necessarily extend to stocks of workers in the two sectors (for which we do not have information). However, we may reasonably assume that it is so, unless evidence on stocks surprisingly disconfirms the law of compensating differentials and what has been found by many other authors in this literature.1We prefer to use the term not-for-profit instead of no profit because it better illustrates the nature of firms that do not necessarily have a statutory constraint that prevents them from making a profit but are better characterized by their goal, which is not oriented toward profit maximization.2Among them, the literature emphasizes job security (Sousa-Poza and Sousa-Poza, 2000; Blanchflower and Oswald, 1999; Bryson et al., 2010), having an interesting job (Clark, 2005), the level of involvement (Soohne, 2002), social relatedness (Clark, 1997; Borzaga and Depedri, 2005), and the size of enterprises (Schwochau, 1987; Miller, 1990).3Examples are situations in which the effort required exceeds the acceptable level, the job is excessively physically or mentally demanding, phenomena of bourn-out emerge or there are controls and restrictions on autonomy and on-the-job flexibility.4Examples of the importance of the matching between job and worker characteristics are in Mortensen (1978) and Miller (1984), claiming that turnover of employees emerges in the long run when employees reveal higher or lower abilities than expected in the selection process. A need for matching also emerges when considering intrinsic aspects, such as relationships, because extroverted people tend to be selected into jobs requiring more intensive relationships (Krueger and Schkade, 2008).5Preston (1988) emphasizes that not-for-profit managers are not accountable to shareholders and therefore may be more tempted to waste their cash flows. His hypothesis would imply a wage differential in the opposite direction with respect to the labor donative hypothesis. More generally, the not-for-profit sector is generally much more dependent on government funding and dependence on the public sector may either push wages upward (when the not-for-profit industry is heavily subsidized) or downward (when governments with increasingly severe budget constraints impose minimum price competitions without quality floors in procurement rules). 6This statement has been supported by empirical studies investigating the determinants of job satisfaction. Such studies show that worker utility depends upon factors other than pay and that for employees in not-for-profit organizations these factors are more important than in other organizations (Clark, 1997; Sousa-Poza and Souza-Poza, 2000; Skalli et al., 2008). Examples of matching in social enterprises are those where particular importance is placed by both organizations and employees on the social usefulness of the job (e.g., Borzaga and Tortia, 2006) and similarly where policies of fairness match the tendency of workers to cooperate (Benz, 2005; Valentini, 2005; Tortia, 2008).7Workers in this group voluntarily abandoned their jobs in the for-profit sector without a willingness to enter the not-for-profit sector. We therefore define them as involuntary, making reference to the fact that not all of the decisions needed to produce a move from the for-profit to the not-for-profit sector were voluntary. 8The original definition of intrinsic motivation (Deci, 1975) states that “one is said to be intrinsically motivated to perform an activity when he receives no apparent reward except the activity itself.” Prendergast (2007) applies the concept when interpreting the working effort of bureaucrats that have weak monetary incentives but nonetheless perform their jobs because they care about the outcomes. For further discussion on intrinsic motivations and differences between them and job amenities/disamenities, see section 5.3.9The effect of job amenities and disamenities is assumed to be job specific but identical for both groups of workers (i.e. the two arguments enter the utility function of different individuals in the same way).10Such workers may have ended up in the for-profit industry because of a lack of vacancies in the not-for-profit industry.11The two traditional forms are workers cooperatives (workers are the dominant stakeholders and are attributed benefits in the form of safer working conditions and/or participation in profits) and consumers’ cooperatives (consumers are the dominant stakeholders and are attributed benefits in the form of lower prices and higher quality of goods).12Social cooperatives differ from not-for-profit organizations with a prevalent distributive function (e.g. foundations) or supplying services to a restricted group of beneficiaries (e.g. in associations).13These reserves cannot be appropriated by members even if the firm shuts down its operations. In that case, the residual value of the reserves is to be conferred to a common national fund used to finance the start-up of new cooperatives, adhering to the principle of enlarged mutuality.14In worker cooperatives, the ristorni are represented by end-of-the-year increases in labor remuneration and calculated as a percentage of the wages distributed during the accounting year (up to 30%). In consumer cooperatives, the ristorni are usually represented by end-of-the-year bonuses usable to buy the products sold by the cooperatives and calculated as a per cent of the total amount of products bought during the accounting year.15Trento, Bergamo, Brescia, Milano Bicocca, Napoli, and Reggio Calabria.16Given the reduced size of Italian firms compared with Anglo-Saxon and Northern European firms, in Italy the standard classification is: small firms = under 15; medium firm = between 15 and 50; large firm = over 50 employees.17The rate of nonresponses was extremely low. 85% of involved respondents answered on average 90% of the 87 questions (56 single choice questions and 31 multiple choice questions) enclosed in the questionnaire.18The distortion of the ICSI sample relative to the ISTAT sample is limited, since it amounts to an increased presence of cooperatives located in Northern Italy relative to the cooperatives located in Southern Italy, and a stronger presence of larger cooperatives than in the initial sample. For a more precise account of the differences between the ISTAT 2005 sample and the ICSI 2007 sample, the reader can consult Carpita (2009, Chapter 1: 1–36).19This sample proportion coincides with that of the universe of social cooperative workers.20Assume, in fact, the case in which a given characteristic (i.e. time flexibility) is greater in the not-for-profit than in the for-profit industry. Individuals changing from the for-profit to the for-profit sector (or from the not-for-profit to the not-for-profit) will register no significant change in time flexibility. On the other hand, shifters from one industry to the other will register a significant difference and therefore will report a significantly different comparative judgment when compared with either of the two benchmarks.21The data does refer to an evaluation of interviewed workers and not to a comparison of observed wages. More specifically, workers were asked if their economic treatment was ameliorated or not in moving from the previous job to the employment in the cooperative (see question Q47.i) in the questionnaire).22Unfortunately, it is impossible to know whether they anticipated future expected layoffs, which may bring some pecuniary motivations back into the foreground. 23That is, individuals who answered positively to question 45.iv, who gave a score higher than four to question 48 (improved job satisfaction) and a score lower than four to question 47.i (worse wage).24This is an important point since it reduces the likelihood that voluntary movers are in reality moving because they anticipate negative developments (in terms of probability of remaining employed or career path) in the for-profit job they leave. 25Sectors of social cooperatives of type A: social assistance; health assistance; education assistance; cultural activities; recreation services; other. Sectors of social cooperatives of type B: agriculture and zootechnics; gardening; garbage collection; manufacture; sales in shops; catering and restaurants; laundry; building; cleaning; IT, typography; and call center.26The result here may be explained by an excess supply of workers graduated in nontechnical subjects, some of whom accept work in the for-profit industry so as not to remain unemployed.27This finding runs counter to what could be the effect of the reasonable assumption of higher attrition for older than younger workers (i.e. older unsatisfied workers are more likely to have already left the sample, therefore leaving the group of “survived” old workers with more favorable comparisons between current and older jobs).28The value zero of the dependent variable therefore includes voluntary movers who do not end up with lower (or equivalent) wages and higher life satisfaction and the other two groups of (laid off or resigned) nonvoluntary movers.29The survey question is Q52. To what extent do you agree with the following statements? Before starting work for this Cooperative: 1. I was very interested in social problems 2. I was looking for a job which involved helping other people 3. I was looking for personal fulfillment at work 4. I was curious and open-minded about current affairs issues 5. I considered working relationships were very important 6. I wanted to have more visibility in the community.30Many pairwise correlations are between 0.3 and 0.4, and the highest one (between d8.2 and d8.4) is 0.49. The correlation matrix is omitted for reasons of space and is available upon request.31A rationale for the geographical effect here may be that wages are higher than in the South (Becchetti and Castriota, 2011) and therefore there is more room for a reduction acceptable to the worker or that workers in the Northern regions have a higher level of social capital.32Note that in this case we have only two variables. We therefore alternatively use a simple unweighted average finding that our main results are unchanged. Results are omitted and available upon request. References
