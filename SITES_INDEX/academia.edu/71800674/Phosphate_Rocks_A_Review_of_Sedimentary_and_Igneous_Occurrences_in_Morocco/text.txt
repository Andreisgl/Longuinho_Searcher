They are the primary raw material for phosphoric acid and fertilizers used in agriculture, and are increasingly considered to be a potential source of rare earth elements. Phosphate rocks occur either as sedimentary deposits or igneous ores associated with alkaline rocks. In both cases, the genesis of high-grade phosphate rocks results from complex concentration mechanisms involving several (bio)geochemical processes. Some of these ore-forming processes remain poorly understood and subject to scientific debate. Morocco holds the world’s largest deposits of sedimentary phosphate rocks, and also possesses several alkaline complexes with the potential to bear igneous phosphate ores that are still largely underexplored. This paper summarizes the main geological features and driving processes of sedimentary and igneous phosphates, and discusses their global reserve/resource situation. It also provides a comprehensiv...See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersData Set of World Phosphate Mines, Deposits, and Occurrences: Part B.

As part of this study, a geographic information system was constructed containing a database of phosphate occurrences in Afghanistan and adjacent countries, and a database of potential host lithologies compiled from 1:1,000,000 scale maps. Within Afghanistan, a handful of known occurrences and reports indicate the presence of phosphate in Permian, Cretaceous, and Paleogene sediments and in carbonatite. With the exception of the Khanneshin carbonatite, very little is known about these occurrences. In the countries surrounding Afghanistan, economic phosphate is known to occur in Cambrian, Devonian, and Paleogene sediments and in Kiruna-type Fe-apatite deposits. Many of the host units may extend into Afghanistan or equivalent units may be present. Although the possibility of economic phosphate deposits exist for Afghanistan, the need for detailed expl...Download Free PDFView PDFMineralsReview of the Main Factors Affecting the Flotation of Phosphate OresRachid HakkouThe way to successfully upgrade a phosphate ore is based on the full understanding of its mineralogy, minerals surface properties, minerals distribution and liberation. The conception of a treatment process consists of choosing the proper operations with an adequate succession depending on the ore properties. Usually, froth flotation takes place in phosphate enrichment processes, since it is cheap, convenient, and well developed. Nevertheless, it is a complex technique as it depends on the mineral’s superficial properties in aqueous solutions. Aspects such as wettability, surface charge, zeta potential, and the solubility of minerals play a basic role in defining the flotation conditions. These aspects range from the reagents type and dosage to the pH of the pulp. Other variables namely particles size, froth stability, and bubbles size play critical roles during the treatment, as well. The overall aim is to control the selectivity and recovery of the process. The following review is...Download Free PDFView PDFThe Moroccan High Atlas phosphate-rich sediments: Unraveling the accumulation and differentiation processesel hassane  chellaiDownload Free PDFView PDFMineralium DepositaThe origin and composition of carbonatite-derived carbonate-bearing fluorapatite depositsDavid A.

Phosphate rock, a critical mineral for the production of fertilisers, is key to achieving food security globally. This article reviews the mineralogy, geological nature, processing and economics of this important resource. Apatite is the primary mineral of phosphate rock. Phosphate rock occurs geologically as sedimentary phosphorites, guano, and igneous deposits. Phosphate rocks are beneficiated by flotation. Morocco (Western Sahara, inclusive) and China rank amongst the highest producers of phosphate rock. Africa holds over 80 percent of world's phosphate rock reserves. As at the year 2016, the price of marketable phosphate rock was USD 72 per metric tonne.Download Free PDFView PDFMineralsGeochemistry of Rare Earth Elements in Bedrock and Till, Applied in the Context of Mineral Potential in Sweden2020 • Martiya SadeghiDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of PetrologyPetrogenesis of the Eocene Tamazert Continental Carbonatites (Central High Atlas, Morocco): Implications for a Common Source for the Tamazert and Canary and Cape Verde Island Carbonatites2010 • K.
