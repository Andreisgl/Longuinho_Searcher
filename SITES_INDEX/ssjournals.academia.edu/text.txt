These problems are mainly caused by economic pressure for industrialisation, technological advancement, population growth, poverty and ignorance. Western moral speculations like deep ecology, land ethic, ecofeminism and as well as scientific approaches methodologies have been employed in other to solve this problem.  However these theories have been proven not to be very much effective. African eco-communitarianism as a hypothesis, implanted on Indigenous information framework can contribute to supply a local- developed answer for our current environmental issues. For Africa, environmental ethics is metaphysically embedded in what it means to be or to exist. Consequently, environmental ethics should be understood as stretching from the individual being to involve the communities of other persons, non-human persons as well the environment.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The use of nanoparticles in the treatment of psychotic and cancer problems is analyzed in this report. Psychotic treatment has been effective due to certain nanoparticles like haloperidol and RISP and these combinations are linked with other nanoparticles to treat other diseases. Nanoparticles have extended applications with a high degree of effectiveness to treat cancer cells due to the quick delivery and targeted process and the same is detailed in the review sheet. Oligonucleotides combined with nanoparticles have greater efficiencies.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The amount of poison consumed was about 10-12 ml of 20% concentrate. After consuming poison, stomach wash had been given 3 days back at a nearby primary health centre. On admission at our institute, the only presenting complaint was oliguria. His general condition was stable. Blood pressure was slightly higher-140/100mmHg. Systemic examination was within normal limits. Chest X ray done showed no significant abnormality Fig1: Chest X Ray at presentation without any significant abnormality IJBR (2013) 04 (12) Abstract Paraquat poisoning can result in lung, kidney, heart, suprarenal gland damage but development of pneumothorax following paraquat consumption is rare. We report one such case.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
