Laura StarkUniversity of Jyväskylä,  Dept. of History and Ethnology,  Faculty MemberSlums and informal settlements+16I was born and raised in Northern California, and have lived permanently in Finland since 1992. I received my Master's degree in anthropology from the University of California, Davis, and my Ph.D. in folklore studies from the University of Helsinki. I am currently professor of Ethnology at the University of Jyväskylä, Finland. I have published on magic and witchcraft, folk religion and pilgrimage, Finnish modernization ‘from below’, self-educated rural inhabitants’ writings to 19th-century Finnish newspapers, Finnish agrarian society in the 19th century including gender relations, and 19th-century concepts of body and self in rural Finland. My current research interests include issues surrounding urban poverty, sexuality and early marriage in Eastern Africa, with a special focus on slums and mobile phones for development. I have led several research projects, including 'Mobile technology, gender and development in Africa and India' (funded by the Academy of Finland 2010–2013) , and the project 'Urban Renewal and Income-Generating Spaces for Youth and Women in Ethiopia and Tanzania' (funded by Academy of Finland 2013–2017). I was the coordinator for the North-South-South teaching network “Living with Informal Settlements, Tackling Urban Poverty (LIFT UP)” funded by the Finnish Ministry of Foreign Affairs/CIMO for the period 2011–2013, in which partner countries included Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, and Mali.less317 Followers124 Following7 Co-authorsTotal Views ;69 Public MentionsFollowFollowingCVall86 Papers5 Funded Research Projects5 Books2 Conference Presentations1 List of publications (updated)More  1 DraftsPapersNarrative and the social dynamics of magical harm in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century FinlandWitchcraft Continued,  Jul 30, 2018Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

An analysis of 165 interviews conducted in two low-income neighborhoods in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania over 8 years demonstrates how interlocked layers of technology and interaction make mobile money services semiformal. I introduce two mobile money-enabled survival strategies: intrahousehold transfers for day-to-day survival (transfers within the same city) and resource safeguarding through kin remittances of start-up capital (home-based subsistence business capital stored for kin access in emergencies). The recent tightening of mobile phone regulations in the global South has disrupted users’ multilevel and formal/informal-hybrid infrastructures of money movement in these communities. Such tougher regulations could result in a new digital divide that hinders rather than facilitates the financial inclusion of the poor.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

They are places for people to exercise and carry out social activities, they influence the water cycle, and have considerable impact on air quality. In the developed world, companies are attracted to locations that offer well designed, well managed public spaces and these in turn attract customers, employees and services (Jason & Neil, 2010). The presence of green parks, squares, gardens and other public spaces in urban areas have therefore become vital marketing tools. Well-planned areas with green open spaces offer benefits to the local economy in terms of raising real estate prices (ibid). Open spaces facilitate social communication, relaxation and recreation, and promote trade and tourism (Catharine, 2002). Open spaces are among a city’s most valuable assets that are threatened by rapid urban transformation. Protecting these open spaces and maintaining sustainable growth in cities is vital for residents’ well-being in cities.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The majority of urban residents find themselves ‘entangled within power dynamics that position them at the city’s margins, literally and figuratively’ (Myers 2011: 13). Although urban informality is defined by its ‘illegality’ from the perspective of regulatory elites (Potts 2007), some informal activities are viewed as predatory or harmful by the urban residents who must deal with them in their everyday lives. These include bribery by officials and service providers, dispossession of inheritance by relatives, brokerage fraud, extortion by local government officials, and the harassment carried out by security guards against street vendors. Taken together, these practices constitute both obstacles to accessing resources by the poor and impediments to residents’ abilities to keep their hard-won resources.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Scholars of poverty and development have given more attention to rural areas than to urban ones, yet urban lifeways need more study because people’s material lives in the city differ significantly from those in rural areas. Urban residents are exposed to more ethnic, religious, and socio-economic diversity than are rural residents (Jha et. al. 2005). Urban areas are also highly monetized, and the lives of especially the poorest residents are determined almost entirely by market forces. Money thus becomes the focus of city dwellers’ attention: the means by which relationships are negotiated, the measure of success, and a necessary condition for well-being. This volume defines ‘urban’ as residential aggregations in which the majority of residents work in non-agricultural activities, which generally means they are also settled more densely. Not all urban spaces are large cities, they can be small shantytowns appearing in otherwise rural areas. What is important in our definition of ‘urban’ is not its size or infrastructure but the resource base (predominantly non-agricultural) and dynamics of human interaction based on the range of interlocking occupations and levels of activity.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This nephrite figurine, about 16 centimeters high, has a human head, the mouth of which is covered by a duck bill with an egg tooth. Around the sides are nine columns with nearly 70 glyphs. La Mojarra Stela 1, recovered from the Acula River in 1986, has dates of 143 and 156 4.D., and is the oldest example of an extended written text, and perhaps the most important inscription ever discovered in Mesoamerica. The Center for Maya Research published a description and a line drawing of the monument (Winfield Capitaine 1988), making the data available to scholars. The inscription on the La Mojarra Stela is many times longer than that of the Tuxtla Stafuette. There are interesting differences, but for the most part the script is identical. Several other glyphic texts have been identified with this inscription, among them the El Sitio celt, a carved monkey mask, and a pottery sherd from Chiapa de Corzo. Of these, only the last contains numerous matching signs and the down-curved horizontal bar identified by Méluzin (1987:69) and Winfield (1988:20) as an &amp;quot;ending&amp;quot; sign. The carved monkey mask and the El Sitio inscription appear to be related, but different, scripts. The inscription on the Chiapa de Corzo sherd is so brief that it is of limited usefulness in script analysis. Most of the comments in this catalog pertain only to the inscriptions on the La Mojarra Stela and the Tuxtla Statuette. One of the first tasks in preparation for decipherment is to establish the list of graphemes, the minimal meaningful graphic elements, of the script. This involves determining the number of occurrences of a grapheme, identifying variants of a single sign, and distinguishing between compound graphemes (a grapheme composed of two or more elements) and grapheme compounds (a compound sign composed of two or more graphemes). Since the meanings of the individual graphemes are unknown, the signs must be named or numbered so that they can be referred to in a uniform manner by scholars.

This colorful array of ritulas and beliefs involving nature spirits, saints, the dead, and pilgrimage to monasteries represented a unigue fusion of official Church ritual and doctrine and pre-Christian ethnic folk belief. This book undertakes a fascinating exploration into many aspects of Orthodox Karelian ritual life: beliefs in supernatural forces, folk models of illness, body concepts, divination, holy icons, the role of the ritual specialist and healer, the divide between nature and culture, images of forest, the cult of the dead, and the popular image of monasteries and holy hermits. It will appeal to anyone interested in popular religion, the cognitive study of religion, ritual studies, medical anthropology, and the folk traditions and symbolism of the Balto-Finnic peoples.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Why did farm mistresses engage home thievery and why were writers so harsh in their disapproval of it? Why did many men in their letters nonetheless sympathize with women’s pilfering? What opinions did farm daughters express?This book explores theoretical concepts of agency and power applied to the 19th-century context and takes a closer look at the family patriarch, resistance to patriarchal power by farm mistresses and their daughters, and the identities of those Finnish men who already in the 1850s and 1860s sought to defend the rights of rural farm women.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Many of the original source materials on women's magic rituals are translated into English for the first time.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
