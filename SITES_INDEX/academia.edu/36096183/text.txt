KroezeA practitioner is a professionally employed person in a selected discipline such as information and communication technologies (ICT). ICT practitioners often operate in the domain of Information Systems (IS), the social science branch of ICT. Practitioner research comprises of research that practitioners undertake with a view to the advancement of their practice. Questions arise in respect of research conducted by ICT practitioners: (1) What is the context of the IS professional when conducting practitioner-based research; and (2) Does practitioner-based research have a theoretical base and does practitioner-based research challenge the traditional dichotomy between positivist and interpretivist research in IS? An investigation and discussion of these questions in the IS discipline is the objective of this article. In this article, ICT practitioner-based research in organisations is discussed. Some philosophical underpinnings of practitioner-based research are probed and a reflection on practitioner research is given. It is suggested that active ICT practitioners are a necessity in the IS research domain. Their participation requires that the actual context in which IS practices are conducted, should be analysed. To ensure that such IS research is valid, an epistemological base is needed for critical reflection and thoughtful action from which to draw.Download Free PDFView PDFChapter 3 Research design and methodologyFemi towoeniDownload Free PDFView PDFUNISA UNIVERSITY (UNISA)KEY ASPECTS OF QUALITY ASSURANCE IN THE TEACHING AND TRAINING OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN POLICE SERVICE IN THE NORTHERN CAPE2010 • Dr Dr Motsamai John Modise MJDownload Free PDFView PDFNurses Clinical Experiences Research part 2 ChaptersThokozile KgongwanaABSTRACT Key words: Clinical training, work integrated learning, clinical facilities and competence. Background: Nurse Education is a combination of theoretical and practical components, which requires integration of theory and practice in health facilities. The problem is that the learners are placed in clinical facilities such as old age homes; the SANC Professional Misconduct statistics of July 2003 to July 2008 confirm that the competency of nurses reflects challenges. Such problems might not only jeopardise quality patient care, but also the quality of clinical training and exposure of nurses Purpose: The aim of the study was to explore the first-year nursing learners’ clinical experiences at a private nursing school. Process: A random invitation was issued to learners who were registered for the first year of the enrolled nursing programme at a private nursing school between January 2011 and July 2013. Thirty one learners participated voluntarily in the study; they completed a questionnaire with open-ended and closed questions which was further analysed within four coded themes. Results and discussion: The learners expressed negative and positive clinical experiences and affirmed that the old age homes are the clinical facilities without the appropriate infrastructure for clinical training. They recommended the need to strengthen support and mentoring of the clinical staff members and learners in in diverse clinical facilities. Conclusion: The study confirms and supports the need to rethink strengthening the training and education of clinical training in nursing education considering the standard practice of the SANC on the theoretical assessment and the Nursing Care model and Higher Education Good Practice guide.Download Free PDFView PDFQualitative Research School of thoughtDorcas OkyereDownload Free PDFView PDFProject example for refrence onlineJatin ThakurDownload Free PDFView PDFExcel India PublishersUnderstanding philosophical underpinnings of research with respect to various paradigms: Perspective of a research scholar2019 • Diwakar SinghDownload Free PDFView PDFComprehensive Research Proposal Example 1[1]Filippus MosesDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
