Quotes[edit]
I hope so. :-) Although the wiki process sometimes strikes people as being inherently favoring egalitarianism or anarchy, there is a certain sense in which the wiki editing tool is neutral to social structures. As a matter of simple description, it does turn out that users who do quality work end up having a lot more power than users who do bad work. So in that sense, yes, it is a meritocracy, but an informal one.
Jimbo Wales in Interview with Jimbo Wales (December 10, 2005) answering the question: Do ... Wiki projects qualify as a meritocracy?
