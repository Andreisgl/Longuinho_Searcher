An effective rearing system to produce large numbers of high-quality natural enemies is generally required in biological control programs for several reasons : 1) to study the insect itself for information pertaining its biology, behavior, life history, and ecology; 2) to facilitate the establishment of new natural enemies by rearing large numbers for release; and 3) to supply routinely or at a speciÞed time large numbers of natural enemies for releases against the target pest over the generally infested areas.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersJournal of Economic EntomologyBiology, Life History, and Laboratory Rearing of <i>Spathius galinae</i> (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), a Larval Parasitoid of the Invasive Emerald Ash Borer (Coleoptera: Buprestidae)2000 • Jian DuanDownload Free PDFView PDFEnvironmental EntomologyResponses of an Idiobiont Ectoparasitoid, <I>Spathius galinae</I> (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), to Host Larvae Parasitized by the Koinobiont Endoparasitoid <I>Tetrastichus planipennisi</I> (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae): Implications for Biological Control of Emerald Ash Borer (Coleoptera: Buprestidae)2012 • Jian DuanDownload Free PDFView PDFBiological ControlThe effect of bark thickness on host partitioning between Tetrastichus planipennisi (Hymen: Eulophidae) and Atanycolus spp. (Hymen: Braconidae), two parasitoids of emerald ash borer (Coleop: Buprestidae)2012 • Jian DuanDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Economic EntomologySuitability and Accessibility of Immature <I>Agrilus planipennis</I> (Coleoptera: Buprestidae) Stages to <I>Tetrastichus planipennisi</I> (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae)2010 • Leah BauerDownload Free PDFView PDFBiological ControlMultiparasitism by Tetrastichus planipennisi (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) and Spathius agrili (Hymenoptera: Braconidae): Implication for biological control of the emerald ash borer (Coleoptera: Buprestidae)2013 • Jian DuanDownload Free PDFView PDFFlorida EntomologistBiology and Life History of Tetrastichus planipennisi (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae), a Larval Endoparasitoid of the Emerald Ash Borer (Coleoptera: Buprestidae)2011 • Leah BauerDownload Free PDFView PDFEnvironmental entomologyGrowth of Larval Agrilus planipennis (Coleoptera: Buprestidae) and Fitness of Tetrastichus planipennisi (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) in Blue Ash (Fraxinus quadrangulata) and Green Ash (F. pennsylvanica)2015 • Jian DuanEmerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire) is an invasive primary pest of North American ash (Fraxinus spp.) trees. Blue ash (F. quadrangulata) is less susceptible to emerald ash borer infestations in the forest than other species of North American ash. Whereas other studies have examined adult host preferences, we compared the capacity of emerald ash borer larvae reared from emerald ash borer eggs in the field and in the laboratory to survive and grow in blue ash and the more susceptible green ash (F. pennsylvanica). Emerald ash borer larval survivorship was the same on both ash species. Mortality due to wound periderm formation was only observed in living field grown trees, but was low (&lt;4%) in both green and blue ash. No difference in larval mortality in the absence of natural enemies suggests that both green and blue ash can support the development of emerald ash borer. Larvae reared from eggs on blue ash were smaller than on green ash growing in the field and also in ...Download Free PDFView PDFBiological ControlThe effect of bark thickness on host partitioning between Tetrastichus planipennisi (Hymen: Eulophidae) and Atanycolus spp.(Hymen: Braconidae), two …2012 • Kristopher AbellDownload Free PDFView PDFEnvironmental EntomologyMeasuring the Impact of Biotic Factors on Populations of Immature Emerald Ash Borers (Coleoptera: Buprestidae)2010 • Jian DuanDownload Free PDFView PDFEnvironmental EntomologyEffects of Host Plant and Larval Density on Intraspecific Competition in Larvae of the Emerald Ash Borer (Coleoptera: Buprestidae)2013 • Jian DuanDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
