In the absence of a living culture to record, archaeologists extrapolate this information from behaviour reconstructed from spatially determined patterns in the deposition of material remains and from patterns found in the general organizing principles of historically documented cultures, using arguments based on analogy. This contribution builds on our previous research on the “Sea Peoples” as a piratical culture in order to apply an anthropological approach to understanding the cultural identities of the various tribal groups involved in maritime activities at the end of the Bronze Age who are popularly known as the “Sea Peoples”, and place this within the broader context of the current discussions on the transition between the Late Bronze and Early Iron Age in the Mediterranean.Save to LibraryDownloadby Aren M .

This research is connected to the unexpected discovery of interconnecting archaeological, epigraphical, and iconographical evidence that attests to the presence of Israelites in Egypt over virtually the entire 430 years. By the sheer volume of verifiable evidence of complementary historical data—when comparing the biblical text and the artifactual and epigraphical record—the author attempts to demonstrate convincingly to objective readers that the biblical story of the Egyptian origins of the Israelite ‘nation’ is reliable as a factual account. Never again will students of the Bible have to listen to uniformed university professors denounce the story of Israelites in Egypt without a ready defense for its validity.Save to LibraryDownloadby Douglas N Petrovich•  20  Egyptology, Hebrew Language, Hebrew Bible, Biblical Studies(2016) The World's Oldest Alphabet: Hebrew as the Language of the Proto-Consonantal Script (frontmatter)For about 150 years, scholars have attempted to identify the language of the world’s first alphabetic script, and to translate some of the inscriptions that use it.

Until now, their attempts have accomplished little more than identifying most of the pictographic letters and translating a few of the Semitic words. With the publication of The World’s Oldest Alphabet, a new day has dawned. All of the disputed letters have been resolved, while the language has been identified conclusively as Hebrew, allowing for the translation of 16 inscriptions that date from 1842–1446 BC. These inscriptions expressly name 3 biblical figures and greatly illuminate the earliest Israelite history in a way that no other book has achieved, apart from the Bible.Save to LibraryDownloadby Douglas N Petrovich•  25  Egyptology, Hebrew Language, Hebrew Bible, Biblical StudiesGlatz, C. 2020.

The volume provides a new, critical account of the Hittite imperial network of Late Bronze Age Anatolia (c. 1600-1180 BCE), one of the earliest archaeologically well-attested imperialist polities of the ancient Near East, through detailed analyses of a wide range of archaeological, iconographic, and textual sources. Concerned with the analysis and communication of the complexity, messiness, and ever transforming nature of imperial relationships, the book examines the practices through which Hittite elites and administrators hoped to bind together disparate communities and achieve a measure of sovereignty in particular places and landscapes, and with the help of particular material things. It also tracks the ambiguities inherent in these practices, their messy results, their un- and under-achievements, and how they were resisted, or more subtly negotiated in different regional and cultural contexts.Save to LibraryDownloadby Claudia S Glatz•  8  Archaeology, Anatolian Studies, Ancient Near East, Ancient Near Eastern HistoryHistorische Geographie im Gebiet des Mittleren Euphrats zwischen Karkemish und Tuttul zur Mittleren und Späten BronzezeitSave to LibraryDownloadby Adelheid Otto•  7  Historical Geography, Near Eastern Archaeology, Ancient Near East, Ancient Near East (Archaeology)“Mezopotamya Erken Dönem Sanatı”, Aktüel Arkeoloji 71 (Eylül-Ekim), İstanbul 2019: 82-85.Save to LibraryDownloadby Şevket Dönmez•  20  Sumerian Religion, Archaeology, Near Eastern Archaeology, Historical Archaeology“From where came the Hyksos and where did they go”, in: M.

Analogical hermeneutics was prompted by the polysemic and homophonic nature of cuneiform writing and was intended as an inquiry into the cuneiform system itself. Analogical reasoning is also well known in ancient Greece particularly in Heraclitus producing semantic proliferation and ambiguity. A comparison between Mesopotamian and Greek sources shows that Heraclitus’ fragments share with cuneiform scholarship a similar epistemic reasoning based on analogy. The present contribution aims at setting the Babylonian epistemological system in light of Heraclitus' philosophy.Save to LibraryDownloadby Maurizio Viano•  18  Sumerian Religion, Philosophy, Greek Literature, Near Eastern StudiesM.Ö. 6-5.

The paper will also attempt to explain how did the “Ubaid expansion” contribute to the formation of hierarchical societies in Greater Mesopotamia. Indeed, the biggest weakness of the model of expansion (drawn from the subsequent “Uruk expansion”) is that it ignores multiregional character of the Ubaid interaction sphere and describes the culture contact between south and north Mesopotamia as a core-periphery dichotomy. Uruk expansion was probably an actual colonial phenomenon, but it is difficult to use the same argument to explain the “Ubaid expansion”. Several arguments (exchange, colonization, emulation and technology transfer) have been proposed for the widespread dissemination of Ubaid material culture in Upper Mesopotamia. The present paper proposes to outline and discuss these competing arguments in the hope of contributing to the early complex societies literature and to answer how and why the Ubaid expansion emerged.Save to LibraryDownloadby İzzet Çıvgın•  17  History, Ancient History, Cultural History, Economic HistoryStoria antica.

See http://www.oxbowbooks.com/oxbow/the-parthian-and-early-sassanian-empires.html [Published by the British Institute of Persian Studies (BIPS) Archaeological Monographs Series]ABSTRACTThe old rivalry between branches of the Parthian royal houseand clans, including the Younger (western) Arsacids, theGondopharids in Indo-Parthia, the Sūrēn and Kārin, revivedwhen a rebellion broke out in Persis under the leadershipof Ardashir I, son of the Gondopharid prince Sāsān. Theconnections between the Gondopharids of Sakastan andthe Sūrēn with Persis under Ardashir eventually led to theoverthrow of the Younger Arsacids.A comparison of the diverse traditions about Sāsān showsthat the Persian writings and Sasanian inscriptions weremanipulated for specific political reasons. The Shahnamehtradition traces Sāsān’s ancestry to the late Kayanids, harkingback to the historical Achaemenids. The same traditionsuggests that the ancestral seat of Sāsān’s forebears was inIndia, where they had fled in fear of Alexander. Sāsān wasin fact a member of the Arsacid Gondopharid line, the rulingdynasty of Indo-Parthia, who reigned in Afghanistan and thenorth-western regions of India. Even under Farn-Sāsān theyheld Sakastan, Arachosia and probably part of Sind.Most probably Sāsān was the father of Ardashir, asindicated by the Shahnameh, Agathias and the Armenianauthors, and as implied by Narseh’s inscription at Paikuli.The coins and inscriptions of Ardashir I and Shapur I sayArdashir I was the son of Pābag. Tabari, Kārnāmāg andBundahishn give a version that Ardashir’s father was Pābag,but include Sāsān in the genealogy.For reasons of propaganda Ardashir I, and later Shapur I,endeavoured to downplay Sāsān’s role, so as not to beperceived in Persis/Fars as a foreign dynasty. The paradoxis that, assuming Sāsān was Ardashir’s father, the Sasaniandynasty in fact had a Parthian, and perhaps even an Arsacidancestry. Moreover, the early Sasanians built up their empirethanks to the support of the chief clans of Parthia includingthe Sūrēn and Kārin. That is why the Sasanian Ērānšahrhas been referred to as “the empire of the Persians andParthians”. And that is why Ammianus perceived the royalhouse of Persia as the Arsacids.Save to LibraryDownloadby Marek Jan Olbrycht•  18  Ancient History, Archaeology, Near Eastern Archaeology, Near Eastern StudiesThe Transformation of the Sumerian Temple HymnsSave to LibraryDownloadby Peeter Espak•  11  Sumerian Religion, Near Eastern Studies, Assyriology, Hebrew BibleReview of A.

Despite the volume of documents, Mesopotamian slavery remains elusive in its general traits. This is partly due to the nature of the sources, but also to the approaches and interpretations of modern scholars. Slavery in ancient Mesopotamia has been the focus of several studies in the 1960s and 1970s that interpreted the sources using comparative approaches and Marxist analyses. Since then, the topic has seldom been revisited. In this article, I present the status quaestionis with an overview of the available sources and related studies, together with a sketch of the different types of bonded and forced labor in the Neo-Sumerian period (21st cent. bce).Save to LibraryDownloadby Lorenzo Verderame•  22  Ancient History, Assyriology, Slavery, History of SlaveryElamite War Chariots and Military Equipment at Ancient Kabnak (ca. 1400 BCE) (2021; J.

During the intervening centuries, neither written nor archaeological sources offer clear signs that Elamite territory had come under the authority of any foreign power. Here the authors propose that a reexamination of evidence from the ancient settlement of Kabnak (modern Haft Tepe), approximately seventeen kilometers southeast of the Elamite lowland capital of Susa, discloses a mid-fifteenth to mid-fourteenth century BCE state-controlled arsenal of war chariots and weaponry that may hold a key to comprehending Elam's apparent continued resistance to outside forces and its rise as a military superpower in the thirteenth century.Save to LibraryDownloadby Yasmina Wicks•  8  Military History, Ancient Near East, Elamite, Middle Elamite periodAn den Wassern von Ninive.

Yet the pre-Roman period is educative for testing constitutive IRconcepts such as the balance of power theory, international system, or soft power, which are still widely assumed to have become relevant only in the post-Roman context rather than in the ancient civilizations ofthe Eastern Mediterranean preceding the Greco-Roman experience. This article proposes that insights from IR theory can oﬀer ancient historians and Egyptologists theoretical tools by linking empirical facts to patternsrather than just unique events via conceptual analysis. Udjahorresnet as diplomatic ﬁgure is an important primary source to understand the transition of power from native Egyptian hands to the Achaemenid rule,and thus it provides a case study where micro and macro levels of analyses ﬁnd fertile ground in a cross-disciplinary framework.Save to LibraryDownloadby Alex Aissaoui•  7  Ancient History, IR Theory, Ancient Near Eastern History, Soft Power and International Relations"I Am A Man": Masculinities in the Titulary of the Neo-Assyrian Kings in the Royal InscriptionsSave to LibraryDownloadby Ellie Bennett•  7  Assyriology, Masculinities, Akkadian, Neo-Assyrian studiesOnce More The Nabonidus Chronicle (BM 35382) and Cyrus' Campaign in 547 BCSave to LibraryDownloadby Angelika Kellner•  5  Ancient Greek Historiography, Cuneiform, Achaemenid History, Ancient Near Eastern History2015  Royal pen pals: the kings of Assyria in correspondence with officials, clients and total strangers (8th and 7th centuries BC).

New Research on Transformations in the Eastern Mediterranean in the 13th–11th Centuries BCE, which took place in November 2014 at the Austrian Academy of Sciences in Vienna. It offers up-to-date research on the Sea Peoples phenomenon during the so called “crisis years” at the end of the Bronze Age. This period encompasses dramatic changes in the political and cultural landscape of mainly the Eastern Mediterranean around 1200 BCE and most of the 12th century BCE. In geographical terms, these changes are noticeable in a vast area stretching from the Italian peninsula over the Balkans, the Aegean, Anatolia and Cyprus, to the Levant and Egypt. The term “Sea Peoples phenomenon” should be considered as an encompassing term, which – in addition to the written records on hostile activities of various ethnic groups in the Eastern Mediterranean – is synonymous with the effect of this turbulent period as reflected in the material remains. As a consequence, these events ended the Late Bronze Age, the first period of “internationalism” in human history. The papers are presented in five sections: “Overviews: From Italy to the Levant”; “Climate and Radiocarbon”; “Theoretical Approaches on Destruction, Migration and Transformation of Cultures”; “Case Studies: Cyprus, Cilicia and the Northern and Southern Levant”; and “Material Studies”. The reader of this volume gains insights into very complex changes during this period. It will become clear that these changes manifest themselves over decades and not years, and include numerous underlying factors: One single wave of migration, one general military campaign and other simple explanations should be dismissed. The breakdown of Late Bronze Age societies and the transformative processes that followed in its wake occurred in a vast area but they are mirrored in differing ways at local levels."Save to LibraryDownloadby Jeff Emanuel•  19  Archaeology, Near Eastern Archaeology, Mediterranean prehistory, Archaeological SciencePotts 2018 - Bīsotūn and the French Enlightenment.

It discusses a report on the monument published by the cartographer and historian Jean-Baptiste Bourguignon d'Anville, which originated with the Decalced Carmelite monk Emmanuel de Saint-Albert (born Jean-Claude Ballyet); who transmitted it to Isaac Bellet, a doctor involved in secret negotiations in Constantinople; who in turn sent it to Louis, Duke d'Orléans, in Paris; who passed it on to d'Anville.

Uruk played a leading role in the early urbanization of Sumer in the mid-4th millennium BC. By the final phase of the Uruk period around 3100 BCE, the city may have had 40,000 residents, with 80,000-90,000 people living in its environs, making it the largest urban area in the world at the time. The legendary king Gilgamesh, according to the chronology presented in the Sumerian king list, ruled Uruk in the 27th century BC. The city lost its prime importance around 2000 BC in the context of the struggle of Babylonia against Elam, but it remained inhabited throughout the Seleucid (312–63 BC) and Parthian (227 BC to 224 AD) periods until it was finally abandoned shortly before or after the Islamic conquest of 633–638.William Kennett Loftus visited the site of Uruk in 1849, identifying it as "Erech", known as "the second city of Nimrod", and led the first excavations from 1850 to 1854.The Arabic name of Babylonia, which eventually became the name of the present-day country, al-ʿIrāq, is thought to derive from the name Uruk via Aramaic (Erech) and possibly via Middle Persian (Erāq) transmission.In Sumerian, the word uru could mean "city, town, village, district, circular area"Save to LibraryDownloadby David Vanderper•  20  Sumerian Religion, History, Ancient History, Prehistoric ArchaeologyUgariticSave to LibraryDownloadby Juan-Pablo Vita•  18  Semitic languages, Comparative Semitic Linguistics, Ugaritic Language, Ancient Near EastNextLast »Related TopicsAncient Near EastFollowFollowingAssyriologyFollowFollowingAncient Near East (Archaeology)FollowFollowingAncient Near Eastern LanguagesFollowFollowingNear Eastern ArchaeologyFollowFollowingMesopotamian ArchaeologyFollowFollowingNear Eastern StudiesFollowFollowingAkkadianFollowFollowingMesopotamia HistoryFollowFollowingCuneiformFollowFollowing 71.6 million researchers use this site every month.
