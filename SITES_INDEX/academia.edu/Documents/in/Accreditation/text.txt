Dental hygienists must think critically and develop problem-solving strategies during their formal education to ensure lifelong quality and ongoing development of their personal knowledge and skill as related to providing comprehensive, evidence-based patient care. The primary focus of this qualitative investigation was to obtain undergraduate dental hygiene students&#39; perceptions of and experiences with self-assessment. The sample consisted of an intact undergraduate dental hygiene class of seventeen students in their final semester of a two-year, entry-level dental hygiene program at a community college in the southeast United States. Data for this research were obtained from three sources: 1) a program-designed self-assessment survey assignment, 2) in-depth interviews with four second-year dental hygiene students, and 3) program-de...Save to LibraryDownloadby C.

This paper highlights the importance of integrating CSR into the mainstream of business schools' curricula, arguing for the responsible role that business schools should play but also emphasizing the strategic case for such integration. The paper analyzes the main challenges and opportunities that both hinder and facilitate mainstreaming of CSR at the heart of the business school curriculum and the role that the Principles of Responsible Management Education (PRME) can potentially play in this regard. The paper illustrates these drivers and constraints in the context of one specific business school in Lebanon that has successfully experimented with CSR mainstreaming, leading to a nuanced reflection on the possibilities of a real paradigmatic change in the context of higher management education at this critical juncture and what it is going to take to catalyze a real transformation beyond " bells and whistles " and mere rhetoric.Save to LibraryDownloadby Dima Jamali•  4  Corporate Social Responsibility, Accreditation, Business Schools, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)İçmimarlık Eğitiminde Akreditasyon: ECIA ve CIDA Ölçütleri KarşılaştırmasıIn this study, the history and diversity of interior architecture education are accounted for.

During the historical course, it is seen that discrete educational understandings have formed and reflected on contemporary interior architecture education. The differences in professional education are causing alienation in the professional knowledge base and culture. In order to protect the professional culture, rights, and limitations, professional organizations were formed. Additionally, to eliminate educational differences and for standardizing educational programs accreditation organizations have been formed.In this study, the competencies constituted by the Higher Education Council, the criteria defined by ECIA in Europe and CIDA in the United States are explored. According to the mentioned criteria, the need for re-structuring of educational programs and the creation of a more unifying educational model is discussed.Save to LibraryDownloadby Nilay Özsavaş Uluçay•  3  Accreditation, Interior Architecture, Professional EducationStandard procedures for adults in accredited sleep medicine centres in EuropeSave to LibraryDownloadby Søren Berg•  14  Patient Safety, Accreditation, Medicine, Humans[Point of care analyses are not used uniformly in primary health care.

The purpose of this survey was to understand the range of testing performed in primary health care in Sweden. The results obtained from the survey have been compared to data on the same topic published twenty years ago. The most frequently performed analyses in primary health care have barely changed in the last twenty years. For example, hemoglobin and sedimentation rate analyses are still prevalent. The variety of analyses performed in primary health care has increased, however. C-reactive protein is now a commonly performed analysis. Moreover, in this survey, the degree to which laboratories are quality assured and accredited has been investigated. Accreditation and quality assurance of laboratories varies regionally in Sweden with those facilities meeting the criteria varying from 0% in a province to 100%.Save to Libraryby Lena Norlund and +1Pia Karlsson•  8  Primary Health Care, Accreditation, Medicine, SwedenLong term care: an essential element of health administration educationSave to LibraryDownloadby C.

Papers that (1) address directly or indirectly the subject of credentialing or of learning curve, (2) report on a surgeon&#39;s performance, (3) are reported as feasibility or learning curve studies, or both, (4) discuss the learning curve issue, and (5) express an expert&#39;s opinion on the learning curve. The number of procedures of the learning curve can not be fixed for all surgeons. Only surgeons in specialized breast cancer centers can succeed in meeting current recommendations with 20 to 30 cases.

Declining numbers of family physicians providing maternity care services may exacerbate disparities in access to maternal and child care, especially in rural and other underserved communities. Accreditation of maternity care fellowships and board certification may be one potential avenue to address this trend. This study sought to understand the perceptions and beliefs of key family medicine stakeholders in advanced maternity care regarding the formalization of maternity care training through fellowship accreditation and the creation of a certificate of added qualification (CAQ). METHODS In 2014 and 2015, the authors conducted semi-structured interviews with 51 key stakeholders in family medicine maternity care.

This process also refers to the protection and promotion of patients’ rights. However, reviewing the criteria and content included in this category in the Israeli context reveals definitions and implications that differ from those presented by the law – specifically the Patient’s Rights Act 1995. Moreover, the rights included in it are not necessarily equally represented in other legislation. Methods This study seeks to examine the question of whether and to what extent the scope, contents, and definitions of patients’ rights in the JCI Standards are similar to or different from patients’ rights as they are addressed and protected in national legislation.

Computer-based interactive patient simulations can help students affect this transfer because simulations allow students to develop and practice problem solving and decision-making skills interactively within the context of patient problems. A program for authoring computer-based interactive simulations is described. Patient simulations can effectively integrate basic science relevance, preparation for clinical problem solving, teaching new clinical content and several other necessary elements into curriculum infrastructure. Case simulations also can contribute to evolving educational standards set out by accrediting bodies.Save to LibraryDownloadby Louis Abbey•  14  Educational Technology, Multimedia, Problem Based Learning, AccreditationQuality Assurance and Improvement Practice in Mental Health Agencies: Roles, Activities, Targets and ContributionsSave to LibraryDownloadby Luis Zayas•  18  Psychology, Mental Health, Community-Based Mental Health Services, Quality ImprovementThe 2005 Model of the Clinical Practice of Emergency Medicine: The 2007 UpdateSave to LibraryDownloadby Douglas McGee•  10  Emergency Medicine, Accreditation, Clinical Practice, HumansIs the Organizational Leadership Committment Principle the Most Significant TQM Principle on Hospital Effectiveness?Total Quality management (TQM) has many principles, and the objective of this study was to determine highest TQM principle which has the greater impact on overall hospital effectiveness as perceived by healthcare professionals working in... moreTotal Quality management (TQM) has many principles, and the objective of this study was to determine highest TQM principle which has the greater impact on overall hospital effectiveness as perceived by healthcare professionals working in accredited governmental hospitals in Jordan.

The predicament is professional motivation, i.e., the problem of how to motivate engineering students to maintain their professional integrity. The special professional responsibilities of engineers are often explained either as an implicit social contract between the profession and society (the “social-contract” view), or as requirements for membership in the profession (the “membership-requirement” view). However, there are empirical data that suggest that such views will not do in Japan, and this is the predicament that confronts us. In this country, the profession of engineering did not exist 10 years ago and is still quite underdeveloped. Engineers in this country do not have privileges, high income, or high social status. Under such conditions, neither the social-contract view nor the membership-requirement view is convincing. As an alternative approach that might work in Japan, I propose a pride-based view. The notion of pride has been analyzed in the virtue-ethics literature, but the full potential of this notion has not been explored. Unlike other kinds of pride, professional pride can directly benefit the general public by motivating engineers to do excellent work even without social rewards, since being proud of themselves is already a reward. My proposal is to foster a particular kind of professional pride associated with the importance of professional services in society, as the motivational basis for professional integrity. There is evidence to suggest that this model works.Save to LibraryDownloadby Tetsuji Iseda•  25  Engineering, Contracts, Philosophy, Applied EthicsDental education in a flat world: advocating for increased global collaboration and standardizationGlobalization is a broad term referring to the increasing connectivity, integration, and interdependence of economies, societies, technologies, cultures, and political and ecological spheres across the world.

This position paper was developed by a working group of the 2007 American Dental Education Association (ADEA) Leadership Institute. The authors explore the effect that globalization has had on dentistry and dental education to date and hypothesize what dental education could look like in the years ahead. While the paper is written from a North American perspective, some of the authors bring international expertise and experience to the topic of global dental education in a flat world.

The manner in which the CACREP Standards addresses the LGBT population is called into question, as the 2009 and the second draft of the 2016 standards continue to be vague concerning this population. The challenge of utilizing the historically exclusive and presently inclusive term “multicultural” in counseling when considering the LGBT population is examined. Recommendations for Counselor Education programs to go beyond the minimal CACREP Standards for preparing students to provide culturally competent services for the LGBT population are offered.

Assessment efforts are often undertaken in business programs without the benefit of a complete and systematic approach. The use of a design-based assessment architecture ensures that assessment efforts are deployed in a systematic manner by focusing attention on critical elements. The key aspects include the structure of assessment elements, defining processes, developing organizational competency in assessment, and the use of appropriate technology. This white paper will introduce the use of a design-based approach as an assessment approach that reflects ACBSP requirements at the program and course level as well as evaluation of the performance of the business unit. Complete systems of methods rooted in design thinking ensure that all pieces of the assessment puzzle are put in place in a complete and systematic manner.Save to LibraryDownloadby Douglas J Gilbert•  2  Accreditation, Accreditation and Quality AssuranceA Blueprint for Implementation of a Structured Portfolio in an Internal Medicine ResidencySave to LibraryDownloadby Anthony Donato•  11  Educational Measurement, Accreditation, Humans, Internal MedicineThe ACHS Care Evaluation Program: A decade of achievementSave to LibraryDownloadby Brian Collopy•  8  Quality, Australia, Accreditation, HumansThe World Health Organization African Region Laboratory Accreditation Process: Improving the Quality of Laboratory Systems in the African RegionSave to LibraryDownloadby Clement Zeh•  9  Africa, Developing Countries, Accreditation, Quality ControlEnvironmental engineering education in North AmericaThe field of environmental engineering is rapidly evolving, and environmental engineering education programmes have been forced to try to keep pace.

Keeping up with all of these changes has been difficult for many university programmes, particularly those that do not have a separate environmental engineering curriculum. As a result, many universities are establishing separate environmental engineering degree programmes or even creating a separate Department of Environmental Engineering.

It responds to the ethics criteria newly integrated into the accreditation process by the Accreditation Board of Engineering and Technology (ABET). It also employs an ethics across the curriculum (EAC) approach; engineers identify the ethical issues, write cases that dramatize these issues, and then develop exercises making use of these cases that are specially tailored to mainstream engineering classes. The different activities and strategies employed in this workshop are set forth. Specific references are made to the cases and exercises developed as a result of these workshops. The paper ends by summarizing the different assessments made of the workshop by addressing the following questions: how did it contribute to the overall ABET effort at UPRM; could other universities benefit from a similar activity; and how did the participants evaluate the workshop?Save to LibraryDownloadby Jose Antonio Cruz•  12  Engineering, Applied Ethics, Health Professional Education, Computer EthicsThe basic skills evaluation deviceSave to LibraryDownloadby Thorana Nelson•  12  Psychology, Family Therapy, Social Work, PsychometricsDance Therapy Today: An Overview of the Profession and Its Practice Around the WorldSave to LibraryDownloadby dita federman•  4  Occupational Therapy, Accreditation, Dance, The ArtsGreat Teachers: How to Raise Student Learning in Latin America and the CaribbeanSave to LibraryDownloadby Barbara Bruns•  20  Information Technology, Nutrition, Lifelong Learning, Higher EducationChanging hospitals: The role of hospital accreditationSave to LibraryDownloadby Stephen Duckett•  15  Sociology, Anthropology, Australia, Quality of Mental Health CareA Decade of Chilean Graduate Program Accreditation: A Push for Internationalization and Issues of MultidisciplinarityChile implemented a new national quality assurance system for its higher education institutions in 2006 that included a set of policies and procedures for graduate education.

Ten years after its implementation, this study looks at the perceived alignments and misalignments between the national accreditation goals and the graduate programs’ visions of improvement. By using the concept of loosely coupled systems, we studied eight science and technology master’s and doctoral programs at four research-oriented Chilean universities. In total, we conducted 26 interviews, visited all campus sites, and analyzed related documents. The results indicate that the national accreditation system improved academic quality across programs by strengthening the influence of university central administrations and raising faculty productivity standards. In particular, the accreditation meant a push for internationalization, which was welcomed at all institutional levels. However, after a decade, the accreditation system seems misaligned with programs’ new improvement efforts, such as the promotion of multidisciplinary work. To some extent, accreditation standards, based on strong disciplinary orientations, penalize a diverse student body and curricular innovation and do not consider the challenges of publishing multidisciplinary research.Save to Libraryby DANIELA XIMENA VELIZ CALDERON•  8  Higher Education, Political Science, Education Policy, AccreditationQuality regulations and accreditation standards for clinical chemistry in TurkeySave to LibraryDownloadby Fikriye Uras•  12  Chemistry, Laboratory Medicine, Turkey, Accreditation2010: Iraqi National Accreditation Standards for Primary Health Care CentersThe Iraqi Ministry of Health takes pride in this heritage and is deeply committed to improving the quantity and quality of hospitals and primary health care centers (PHCCs) in Iraq.
