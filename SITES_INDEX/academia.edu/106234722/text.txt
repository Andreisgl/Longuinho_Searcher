The adult morbidity and mortality rates are currently being dominated by diet-related non-communicable diseases like obesity, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome in various countries. Applying both individualized and community-based health promotion strategies can result in the prevention and control of obesity and hypertension. This study examined the role of nutrition in promoting good health, preventing and treating obesity and hypertension in suburban areas. The prevalence of diet-related non-communicable diseases has been notably reduced as a result of health promotion programs. A diet high in dietary fiber, rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean meats, fish, legumes, non-tropical vegetable oils, and nuts (in moderation) has been promoted. This needs to be adjusted to take into consideration the required calorie intake, unique dietary pre...See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersJournal of Clinical MedicineTrends of Dietary Intakes and Metabolic Diseases in Japanese Adults: Assessment of National Health Promotion Policy and National Health and Nutrition Survey 1995–2019Muhammad Alwan FauziHealth Japan 21 is Japan’s premier health promotion policy encompassing preventive community health measures for lifestyle-related diseases. In this repeated cross-sectional survey, we report 24-year trends of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), obesity, hypertension, and their association with dietary intakes to evaluate Health Japan 21’s impact and identify gaps for future policy implementation. We analyzed data from 217,519 and 232,821 adults participating in the physical examination and dietary intake assessment, respectively, of the National Health and Nutrition Survey 1995–2019. Average HbA1c and BMI have significantly increased along with the prevalence of T2DM and overweight/obesity among males. Despite a significant decrease in daily salt intake, the decline in the combined prevalence of Grades 1–3 hypertension was non-significant. Seafood and meat intakes showed strong opposing trends during the study period, indicating a dietary shift in the Japanese population.

Yet, its global prevalence is increasing, and it remains poorly detected, treated, and controlled in both high- and low-resource settings. From the perspective of members of the International Society of Hypertension based in all regions, we reflect on the past, present, and future of hypertension care, highlighting key challenges and opportunities, which are often region-specific. We report that most countries failed to show sufficient improvements in BP control rates over the past three decades, with greater improvements mainly seen in some high-income countries, also reflected in substantial reductions in the burden of cardiovascular disease and deaths. Globally, there are significant inequities and disparities based on resources, sociodemographic environment, and race with subsequent disproportionate hypertension-related outcomes. Additional unique challenges in specific regions include conflict, w...Download Free PDFView PDFLifestyle Interventions for Prevention and Management of Diet-Linked Non-Communicable Diseases among Adults in Arab Countries2023 • Maryam Naveed Muhammad TariqThe increased incidences of diet-related non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular diseases among adults are becoming the chief public health concern in most Arab countries. Economic expansion has contributed to a nutrition shift from a traditional seasonal diet to Westernized eating habits coupled with a sedentary lifestyle. Despite the rising concern for NCD mortality, public health policies are inadequately addressed. This narrative review aims to discuss the effectiveness of nutritional interventions focusing on diet and physical activity in the management of NCDs among Arab adults. A comprehensive literature search was performed using different database platforms such as Cochrane reviews, Scopus, and PubMed for articles published between 1 December 2012 and 31 December 2021. Fifteen recent research articles addressing NCDs, mainly diabetes and obesity, from different Arab countries were included in this review. Structured lifestyle interventions involving behavioral therapy approaches and personalized goals for diet and physical activity were found to improve specific health outcomes in most studies. Significant improvements in health outcomes were reported for longer-duration interventions with follow-ups. A combination of both online and face-to-face sessions was found to be effective. It is important to identify barriers to physical activity for a culturally acceptable lifestyle intervention and conduct further studies to evaluate interventions for the long-term maintenance of health outcomes.Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of Scientific Research and ReportsThe Knowledge, Attitudes and Lifestyle Practices of Hypertensive Patients in the Cape Coast Metropolis-Ghana2016 • Sarah  DarkwaDownload Free PDFView PDFLancet (London, England)A call to action and a lifecourse strategy to address the global burden of raised blood pressure on current and future generations: the Lancet Commission on hypertension2016 • Dagmara HeringDownload Free PDFView PDFInternational Journal Of Community Medicine And Public HealthRisk factors of hypertension in Indian adults: a systematic review (1994-2014)Amitava AcharyyaHypertension is among the most common non-communicable diseases globally. In India the incidence of hypertensive cases has been on the rise. Among the last few decades not only hypertension has become common in elderly but recently many cases have been reported in the young adults in India. Despite this emerging as one of the future public health concerns, there has been limited research regarding the factors that may be responsible for causing hypertension involving young and middle-aged adults and the findings remain inconclusive. The main aim of this study was to identify the risk factors responsible for developing hypertension in Indian adults. A systematic review of the available literature around the research question was carried out. Total 9 primary studies were identified after a thorough search of databases and screening strategy. Studies published between the years 1994 to 2014 and looking into risk factors of hypertension in the Indian adult population were considered.

It is caused by either modifiable or non-modifiable factors in paediatrics. This research would examine the following questions: (1). What are the risk factors for cardiovascular diseases in children? (2). What interventions for cardiovascular diseases in children exist? and (3). Role of nurses in promoting health of paediatrics with cardiovascular diseases? Method: The articles were analysed using a deductive content analysis. Framework used for this study is the Nola J. Pender Health promotion model. Health promoting behaviour is the target act directed towards achieving a positive health outcome like ideal well-being, personal fulfilment, and productive living.
