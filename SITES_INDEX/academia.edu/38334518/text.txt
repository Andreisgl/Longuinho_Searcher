Unfortunately, most OVC programmes are predesigned and implemented without considering beneficiaries’ perceptions when developing solutions (ALI 2007:15). The purpose of this study was to explore and describe the perceptions of orphans and vulnerable children’s parents/guardians about the effectiveness of Future Families’ children programme in Olievenhoutbosch. This study used a qualitative, explorative and descriptive design. Thirteen parents/guardians of children registered with the Future Families were interviewed on the effectiveness of the Future Families programme using a semi-structure interview guide. The study results suggested that parents/guardians were happy with Future Families’ services and believed the programme is effective in responding to their families’ needs.

According to the analysis of survey data presented in this Situation Analysis, vulnerability is widespread among children in Uganda. The vulnerability score contributes to the overall goal of this Situation Analysis by providing an easily accessible tool to prioritize the circumstances of the most vulnerable children in the Ugandan context and to facilitate planning a response by policy makers and program implementers. The widespread levels of children’s vulnerability remain a cause of great concern, raising questions about the ability of existing services to address such high levels of need, and the efficiency of setting targeting criteria to guide service delivery. Stakeholders concur that they are overwhelmed by the task of providing services to such high levels of vulnerable children in increasingly dire circumstances. The assessment of external support received by children in the survey illustrated how few are actually being reached. The best case scenario was medical support reaching only 15 percent of the children in the households surveyed. A major area that is deficient in the effort to help vulnerable children is coordination and networking. Some respondents reported a few examples of successful coordination at the district level and networking on a particular issue like child protection. However, most respondents were of the view that the organizations providing support to vulnerable children were largely uncoordinated and not networking. Continuous monitoring of the situation of vulnerable children is another area of paramount importance that is not well done. To this end, process and output indicators need to be incorporated into regular household surveys. External support needs to be monitored at national, local and organizational levels to assess the coverage and effectiveness of support programs.Download Free PDFView PDFFACTORS INFLUENCING THE PROVISION OF CASH TRANSFER TO ORPHANS AND VULNERABLE CHILDREN IN KILIFI COUNTY, KENYA.Martin Otundo RichardABSTRACT This study sought to establish the factors influencing the provision of cash transfer to OVC. Cash transfers are regular and predictable. They are in form of cash provided by the state as a social contract with her citizens. This study will lend knowledge to government personnel, and stakeholders working in programmes for OVC. Researchers will use the findings from this study to do more research. The Literature review focused on the role of various players in the provision of cash transfer to OVC in Kenya. Management systems in the OVC programme play an important role in issuing guidelines on the implementation of the programme. The OVC Secretariat plays this role. They budget program implementation costs, prepare the materials for targeting and analyze target data and prepare the OVC caregiver’s payrolls for payment. The chiefs, LOCs and village elders identify the households to be targeted and validate the possible caregivers before they are drafted into the payroll by the OVC Secretariat. District Children Officers are provided funds through the Ministry of Labour, Social Security and Services to implement the programme. They monitor and evaluate the use of funds by the caregivers. Stakeholders play an important role in the OVC cash transfer programme by determining through legislation by parliament budgeting and allocation of resources for implementation of the programme. Funds by the government and donor partners such as UNICEF, DFID and World Bank facilitate the costs of the programme. Education levels of OVC determine who will receive the cash as the programme targets enrolment and retainment of OVC in school. However, socio-cultural factors like negative cultural practices including subjugation of the rights of the girl child and women as well as manipulation of female caregivers by relatives work against the success of this programme. The methodology used in this study was descriptive survey. This brought out the opinions, knowledge as well as attitudes of respondents on the provision of cash transfer to OVC. A group of 249 respondents were targeted for this study. Data collection was by use of Questonaires and an interview schedule. Data analysis was by use of frequency tables and the hypothesis was tested using the Chi Square. Data was analyzed by use of SPSS 17.0Download Free PDFView PDFDETERMINANTS OF IMPLEMENTATION OF CASH TRANSFER PROGRAMMES FOR ORPHANS AND VULNERABLE CHILDREN IN TAITA TAVETA COUNTY, KENYAMartin Otundo RichardABSTRACT According to UNICEF, in 2007, an estimated 145 million children between the ages of 0 and 17 years were orphaned, while in 2014, over 198 million children below the age of 18 years were orphaned, having lost one or both parents. According to UNICEF (2013) the number of OVC who include street children, forced child labourers, sexually exploited children, children forced into marriage and those with disabilities is immense and continues to increase drastically. Children may be made highly vulnerable because of natural disasters, complex emergencies like civil conflicts, extreme poverty, according to the draft Social Protection Strategy paper, a household is said to be “extremely poor” when “its entire income is below food poverty line” (Republic of Kenya, 2009b) or epidemic disease - particularly HIV/AIDS. In this note, the purpose of this study therefore is to find out the determinants of implementation of cash transfer programmes for orphans and vulnerable children in Taita Taveta county, Kenya .The study is guided by four objectives that seek to; examine the influence of financial resources in the successful implementation of Cash Transfer programmes for Orphans and Vulnerable Children in Taita Taveta County, determine the influence of management in the successful implementation of Cash Transfer programmes for Orphans and Vulnerable Children in Taita Taveta County, examine the influence of stakeholders in the successful implementation of Cash Transfer programmes for Orphans and Vulnerable Children in Taita Taveta County, establish the influence of socio-cultural factors in the successful implementation of Cash Transfer programmes for Orphans and Vulnerable Children in Taita Taveta County, Kenya. The objectives also form the themes in literature review. A descriptive survey design research design will be adopted for the study. In the study a stratified random sampling will be done in accordance to the characteristics the elements in the population possess. The research targets managers/owners of women run SMEs in Mombasa County. The target population is about 964 but a population sample of 97 will be used. A pilot study will be conducted to check the instruments reliability and validity. Data will be collected using a structured questionnaire which will be administered personally, via e-mails, enumerators and pick them after they had been filled. Data will be coded and analyzed using the SPSS. The data will be analysed and the variables correlated to check the relationship of data. A regression model will also be fitted to check the changes in the dependent variable that can be explained by variations in the independent variablesDownload Free PDFView PDFLongitudinal OVC Study in Zambia2011 • Ethel MulengaDownload Free PDFView PDFThink for yourself - Think for tomorrow': Exploring the impact of peer-led HIV intervention and psychosocial support groups for vulnerable youth in South AfricaMokhantso G MakoaeDownload Free PDFView PDFThe government of Kenya cash transfer for orphaned and vulnerable children: cross-sectional comparison of household and individual characteristics of those with and withoutLukoye AtwoliBackground The ‘Cash Transfer to Orphans and Vulnerable Children’ (CT-OVC) in Kenya is a government-supported program intended to provide regular and predictable cash transfers (CT) to poor households taking care of OVC. CT programs can be an effective means of alleviating poverty and facilitating the attainment of an adequate standard of living for people’s health and well-being and other international human rights. The objective of this analysis was to compare the household socioeconomic status, school enrolment, nutritional status, and future outlook of orphaned and separated children receiving the CT compared to those not receiving a CT. Methods This project analyzes baseline data from a cohort of orphaned and separated children aged <19 years and non-orphaned children living in 300 randomly selected households (HH) in 8 Locations of Uasin Gishu County, Kenya. Baseline data were analyzed using multivariable logistic and Poisson regression comparing children in CT-HH vs. non-CT HH. Odds ratios are adjusted (AOR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for guardian age and sex, child age and sex, and intra-HH correlation. Results Included in this analysis were data from 1481 children and adolescents in 300 HH (503 participants in CT, 978 in non-CT households). Overall there were 922 (62.3%) single orphans, 324 (21.9%) double orphans, and 210 (14.2%) participants had both parents alive and were living with them. Participants in CT-HH were less likely to have ≥2 pairs of clothes compared to non-CT HH (AOR: 0.32, 95% CI: 0.16-0.63). Those in CT HH were less likely to have missed any days of school in the preceding month (AOR: 0.62, 95% CI: 0.42-0.94) and those aged <1-18 years in CT-HH were less likely to have height stunting for their age (AOR: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.47-0.89). Participants aged at least 10 years in CT-HH were more likely to have a positive future outlook (AOR: 1.72, 95% CI: 1.12-2.65). Conclusions Children and adolescents in households receiving the CT-OVC appear to have better nutritional status, school attendance, and optimism about the future, compared to those in households not receiving the CT, in spite of some evidence of continued material deprivation. Consideration should be given to expanding the program further.Download Free PDFView PDFBY LUCY Y.
