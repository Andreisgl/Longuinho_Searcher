Different research paradigms are then discussed, making explicit the assumptions that inform them, and the relationships between methodology, theory and method in conducting research. We then build on this analysis illustrating the distinctive nature of the paradigms with examples from three seminal papers from within the same topic domain, information richness. Drawing on these papers, we discuss how the methodological assumptions determine choice of research paradigm, formulation of research questions and selection of methods, and provide practical examples of how this is achieved. The chapter concludes by summarising the arguments for adopting a broader view of research methodology and its importance for achieving greater reflexive awareness of our 'unconscious metaphysics' that underlay and influence how we see and research the world.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated Papers1.

One problem with the critical tradition is a lack of empirical research. A contributing factor to this gap in the literature is the lack of agreement on what constitutes appropriate methodologies for critical research. The present paper contributes to this debate by exploring the role that focus group research can play in the critical approach.Download Free PDFView PDFOn methods, methodologies and how they matterDubravka Cecez-KecmanovicDownload Free PDFView PDFDevelopment and emancipation The information society and decision support systems in local authorities in EgyptBernd Carsten StahlDownload Free PDFView PDFTowards a critical approach to benefits realisation in the National Health ServiceRebecca  CaseyDownload Free PDFView PDFScandinavian Journal of Information SystemsAustralian Eclecticism and Theorezing in Information Systems Research2007 • Dubravka Cecez-KecmanovicAbstract.This paper reflects on some,significant trends and achievements,in Information Systems ,(IS) theorizing in Australia. Important themes ,identified as typifying Australian eclecticism are (i) the influence of socio-technical thinking; (ii) design and actionapproaches;,(iii) critical theory research; (iv) emphasis on theory,and,theoretical foundations; and (v) some,unusual,approaches to theory. These themes,are seen as emerging,from Australia’s background,as an isolated, distant country with a low populationDownload Free PDFView PDFOntology, Life-World, and Responsibility in ISBernd Carsten StahlThis paper discusses the influence which philosophical ontology has on the ascription of responsibility in IS. It starts out with a description of two ontological positions which are treated under the heading of “positivism” and “life-world”. Positivism is defined as being based on the assumption of an observer-independent objective reality whereas the life-world represents a reality that is created by intentional perception and hermeneutic interaction. In the subsequent section the paper introduces the concept of responsibility as a possible approach to the ethical and moral questions raised by the use of information systems. The final part then proceeds to discuss the influence that the ontological underpinning has on the ascription of responsibility. In conclusion it will be argued that these questions are of fundamental importance to information systems and that philosophical ontology therefore deserves a more explicit place in IS than it currently has.Download Free PDFView PDFInformation Systems: Critical Perspectives.
