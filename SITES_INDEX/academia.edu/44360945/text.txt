Francesca Prescendi Morresi & Irene Becci)Text available at: https://www.cairn.info/imaginaires-queers--9782940648160.htm This text considers some examples of the new literature from India authored by women, where gender, nature, and religion are all engaged in criticism against the sacralised foundation of a society, that justifies and allows the exploitation of its subalterns. Drawing on examples from the universe of visual story-telling, this text discusses a selection of recent graphic novels where epic narration has found fresh space and is being brought to the attention of new audiences. While looking at India’s ancient history and mythological heritage through graphic novel genre, not only the younger generations, but also so-called ‘young adult’, and women especially, have found an unconventional space in which to claim a voice to speak on the country’s traditions, to share ideas, and approach contemporary issues debated in the public.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersSita, Surpanakha and Kaikeyi as political bodies: representations of female sexuality in idealised cultureSara AustinDownload Free PDFView PDFInternational Research and Reviews Journal'The Elephant in the Room': Engaging Women Voices in Indian Comics2021 • Diptarup Ghosh DastidarComics in India have developed in their journey from being children-centric nationalist and educational icons (as in Amar Chitra Katha) to counter-cultural superhero narratives (as in Raj Comicsand Indrajal Comics) and have grown into the social realism of twenty-first century graphic novelsholding the hands of contemporary independent comics artists and graphic novelists. The representation of women in the Indian comics scene before the advent of the graphic novel in 2004 (with Sarnath Banerjee's Corridor) is dominated by masculine projections of femininity, where, given the context of Indian societal values, visuality becomes a pretext of stereotypical depictions and unreal or generally misconstrued gender roles. This paper considers both shortform and longform comics by select women author/artists of India and aims to situate them in the corpus of the Indian comics industry, along with providing a critical evaluation of women representation on the reformed comic book page by said authors and artists. The paper will showcase how contemporary Indian comics by women have been able to naturalize the erstwhile stereotypical and limited attitude towards the body, psyche, and the socio-cultural stance of a woman.Download Free PDFView PDFGNOSIS:  Special  Issue-3 Prospects of Comics Studies in India2019 • Diptarup Ghosh DastidarAlthough the prehistory of comics in India can be traced all the way back to the 1850’s Delhi Sketchbook or the Indian Punch, the proper Indian comics scene can be said to have started from the 1960’s with the publication of Amar Chitra Katha Comics and thriving publishing houses like Raj Comics and Indrajal Comics. Since then, for the past five decades there has been a steady rise not only in the publication of comics in India, but also in its reception and appreciation. The appropriation of the term ‘graphic novel’, coined by Will Eisner, into the Indian scenario has uplifted the importance given to the comics form. Post-1980’s comics artists in India like Sarnath Banerjee, Vishwajyoti Ghosh, Sarbjit Sen, Orijit Sen, Amruta Patil, Appuppen and many others have started their own endeavors instead of working for publishing houses. This along with numerous graphic anthologies in the recent years like Gaysi Zine, This Side: That Side, Longform, and many others have enlarged the scope and directions of studying comics in India. Having discussed the comics scenario, this paper talks about various ways in which the Indian comics industry is affected by the conceptual notions generated in the western world. It also raises questions about the future of comics as a genre in the Indian context and what its place may be in the upcoming researches of the Humanities departments in India.Download Free PDFView PDFDe-territorializing Diversities: Literatures of the Indigenous and the Marginalised. New Delhi: Authorspress, 2014. pp. 170-186.Re-discovery of Indias: Contemporary Writing for ChildrenSucharita SarkarGrowing up in an India where English children’s fiction usually exhibited a marked colonial bias, it was a pleasant surprise when, while sourcing books for my daughters, I came across many new Indian publishers who are bringing out English/bi-lingual books for children which engage with Indian folklore, folk art forms, histories, geographies and multi-cultures in innovative ways that appeal to both children and adults. These narratives explore the pluralities of post-colonial India: city/village, folk/urban, myth/science, forest/highrise, tradition/education, and many others. Publishing houses like Katha (New Delhi, founded in 1989), Tara (Chennai, founded in 1994), Tulika (Chennai, founded in 1996) and Pratham (Bangalore, founded in 2004) are re-imagining marginalised communities and endangered cultures through their carefully-crafted books which are collaborative exchanges among writers, illustrators and translators. By treating literature as a synthesis of languages, story-telling and visuals, these books open up multiple old/new Indias to the curious reader. This is a laudable and brave attempt, especially if we consider the marketing muscle of multinational publishing houses like Puffin and Scholastic, who have de-territorialised indigenous oral and art traditions for children and re-territorialised children’s fiction (especially in urban India) as part of a superimposing ‘Westernised’ narrative. While it may be argued that these books commoditise indigenous cultures and look at marginalised identities from a rose-tinted, superficial perspective, it cannot be denied that these publishing houses are making valuable contributions in managing diversities: by sensitising their target audiences (especially urban children) to ‘other’ voices and identities, by preserving cultural memories, by opening up spaces for cultural transfers, by giving employment opportunities to folk artists and narrators, and by sustaining indigenous oral literatures and art-forms from erasure and extinction.Download Free PDFView PDFCountless Ramayanas: Language and Cosmopolitan Belonging in a South Asian EpicRafadi HakimDownload Free PDFView PDFIntangible Heritage Transformations-Patachitra of Bengal exploring Modern New Media2016 • Dr. Lopamudra Maitra Bajpai (she/her)A traditional performative art from eastern Indiathe patachitra tradition is an integral part of intangible heritage and is an important essence of folk and traditional media. Through centuriesthe patachitra has been a platform where several methods of communication has convergedincluding visual messages, oral traditions and musicall of which helped to amalgamate, involve and portray nature, society and culture coexisting through a lucid dialogue. Thus, these paintingson one hand portrayed society and its ideations like simple photographs down the ages. On the other hand, they also helped to preserve valuable information about social transformations, stories of migrations and details of socio-political and religious reflections as wellall of which helps to form the framework of an important section of the history of the masseswhich often goes uncharted.

For a child, regardless of the culture, the earliest Gurus are elders of a family. Literature is their next guru. Pictures are their first contact with literature. Cartoons are next. When both are combined, their impact on young impressionable minds is phenomenal. Some Picture books like Katha sarita, Panchtantra, JataK Kathyain, Krishan Baal lilyan are nothing but a way of infusing Indian cultural brand of spirituality in an Indian Child. India is a complex of multitude, and there are inherent nuances which have gotten concrete over time. Every facet of society has hierarchy embedded in it and children of each of these individual sections, who are relegated to the margins, need to relate to fill the psychic need of feeling belonging or having an identity. Literature needs to celebrate each of these marginal facets. Paper investigates these rare examples which celebrate these nuances. A fine example is Bhimayana: Experiences of Untouchability which infuses a Dalit child with pride which then translates into belongingness and happiness. This sense of pride in their identity is spirituality for them.Download Free PDFView PDF" SITAYANA " : Retracing " Ramayana " in a feminist light -Aaditi-R-VermaAaditi  Verma“Naatantree vidyate veenaa naachakro vidyate rathah Naapatih sukhamedheta yaa syaadapi shataatmajaa” -Ramcharitramanas (3.39.29) These lines, quoted by “Kavi, “Tulsidas"- in "Ramcharitramanas” states, “just as a veena cannot exist without strings, a chariot cannot exist without its wheels. The life of a woman is precisely incomplete without her husband. Her very identity has no existence, and her happiness should be at stake, no matter if she is the mother of a thousand sons.” The Hinduism which we follow today is a loose adaptation of “Sanatana Dharma”. The dharma, which had the true essence of living, the dharma which spoke of morality, the dharma which treated beings as equals and not as entities, the dharma we were supposed to follow. India being a land of literature and myths has eventually shifted away from the true meaning of life and religious. It is now a land which worships literature, and ironically its characters too. Analyzing from the view point of a literary critic, I now see Rama, not as the lord of “maryada”, but as a mere character of “Ramayana”, whose actions, in the mere piece of literature, now direct the lives of Indians. A matter to consider in detail.Download Free PDFView PDFIn The Routledge Companion to Comics, Editors Roy Cook, Frank Bramlett, and Aaron Meskin.Comics in India2016 • Jeremy StollMany authors and artists in India are conscious of or even directly engaged with international comics, especially from the USA, Japan, and Europe. Yet, Indian comics remain relatively obscure in those same countries. When they are recognized, readers and reviewers tend to frame them as novelties, rather than part of a vibrant comics world. Despite the rich history of this medium on the subcontinent, many critics and scholars remain mired in earlier educational or later transnational comics publishers. This not only loses the complexity of such works, but also holds such works to transnational and often corporate standards. The result is a lack of appreciation for comics communities and an over-emphasis on works that reach readers within well-established industries outside of India. This chapter highlights the tapestry of the medium in this context – with a focus on the people, titles, publishers, and moments that remain important for creators and their communities in India today.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
