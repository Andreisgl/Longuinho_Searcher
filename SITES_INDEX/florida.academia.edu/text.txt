Although Greek authors regularly described distant and exotic peoples as having a just and pious nature, their accounts on Persian adherence to these values are not merely following a topos. Rather, these accounts refl ect genuine Persian practices and beliefs that can be traced to a single Iranian concept: asa, the cosmic principle of order, truth, and justice. This paper offers an overview of all Greek texts that refl ect the many facets of asa and a discussion of the various ways in which Persian reverence for asa was described and adapted for a Greek audience. The paper also looks at how Zoroastrians themselves described asa when writing in Greek. agn54@ufl .eduSave to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Ενα λησμονημένο ιερό των νυμφών στη Βορειοανατολική Θεσσαλία - A Forgotten Sanctuary of the Nymphs in Northeast ThessalyMετάφραση από τα αγγλικά ΑΛΕΞΗΣ ΓΑΛΑΝΟΥΛΗΣ Το 1908, οι βρετανοί αρχαιολόγοι A.

Thompson ανέφεραν την ανακάλυψη ενός αρχαίου ιερού των Νυμφών σε ένα σπήλαιο στο βόρειο μέρος της Όσσας, στο βουνό το οποίο κάποτε ήταν γνωστό ως Όρος της Ομόλης. 2 Σύμφωνα με τους Wace και Tompson, η περιοχή αυτή απείχε μία ώρα δρόμο, περίπου, από τον οι-κισμό Σπηλιά.

Of the more common attributes regularly ascribed to the Per-sians by the Greeks, their devotion to truth and justice was a central one. While on the surface, this appears simply to be a topos in how the Greeks perceived exotic peoples of distant lands 1 , a closer analysis reveals that it refl ects Persian realities. Since they were writing for their fellow countrymen, Greek writers often reported what they knew in approximate and simplifi ed terms, in a manner to which their audience could easily relate. They were also restricted by their own language, which, rich though it was, usually did not have the precise terminology for the Iranian beliefs that they were trying to convey. Nevertheless, this Greek fascination with Persian adherence to truthfulness, justice, and even piety, can be traced to a single Iranian concept: aša. Aša, the abstract principle of cosmic order that encompasses, among other ideas, the related notions of truth and justice, lies at the heart of Zoroastrian-ism. Since truth and justice also played a pivotal role in Greek thought, it is not surprising that the Iranian equivalents of these ideas piqued the interest of the Greeks. When commenting on Persian customs, Greek authors made frequent allusions to truth and justice, such as, e.g., the Persian practice of training their youth to tell the truth (ἀληθίζεσθαι) as part of their education 2. Other, more complex facets of aša can be discerned as well in the accounts of Greek writers. While modern scholars have been able to detect many such references to aša, this concept is more pervasive than often supposed. Moreover, little attention has been paid to the specifi c connotations of what is being related. A closer examination will reveal that Greek authors, far from adopting 1 For example, the Greeks often portrayed the tribes of men dwelling at the edges of the earth as, on the one hand, monstrous and primitive in their appearance and customs , but at the same time, as exceedingly just and ethical. 2 Hdt. 1, 136: for full citation and discussion below pp. 67-69.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
