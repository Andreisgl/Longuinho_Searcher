Tserruya2008, Physical Review CA comprehensive survey of event-by-event fluctuations of charged hadron multiplicity in relativistic heavy ions is presented. The survey covers Au+Au collisions at √ sNN = 62.4 and 200 GeV, and Cu+Cu collisions at √ sNN = 22.5, 62.4, and 200 GeV. Fluctuations are measured as a function of collision centrality, transverse momentum range, and charge sign. After correcting for non-dynamical fluctuations due to fluctuations in the collision geometry within a centrality bin, the remaining dynamical fluctuations expressed as the variance normalized by the mean tend to decrease with increasing centrality. The dynamical fluctuations are consistent with or below the expectation from a superposition of participant nucleon-nucleon collisions based upon p+p data, indicating that this dataset does not exhibit evidence of critical behavior in terms of the compressibility of the system. A comparison of the data with a model where hadrons are independently emitted from a number of hadron clusters...See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersPhysical Review CBeam-energy and system-size dependence of dynamical net charge fluctuations2009 • monika sharma, A.

The data are compared to π0 measurements from the same experiment. For both charged hadrons and neutral pions, the yields per nucleon-nucleon collision are significantly suppressed in central compared to peripheral and nucleon-nucleon collisions. The suppression sets in gradually and increases with increasing centrality of the collisions. Above 4 5 GeV/c in pT , a constant and almost identical suppression of charged hadrons and π0 ’s is observed. The pT spectra are compared to published spectra from Au+Au at √(sNN )=130 in terms of xT scaling. Central and peripheral π0 as well as peripheral charged spectra exhibit the same xT scaling as observed in p+p data.Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of Physics G-nuclear and Particle PhysicsThe energy dependence of pt angular correlations inferred from mean-pt fluctuation scale dependence in heavy ion collisions at the SPS and RHIC2007 • Manuel SPWe present the first study of the energy dependence of $p_t$ angular correlations inferred from event-wise mean transverse momentum $<p_{t} >$ fluctuations in heavy ion collisions. We compare our large-acceptance measurements at CM energies $\sqrt{s_{NN}} =$ 19.6, 62.4, 130 and 200 GeV to SPS measurements at 12.3 and 17.3 GeV. $p_t$ angular correlation structure suggests that the principal source of $p_t$ correlations and fluctuations is minijets (minimum-bias parton fragments). We observe a dramatic increase in correlations and fluctuations from SPS to RHIC energies, increasing linearly with $\ln \sqrt{s_{NN}}$ from the onset of observable jet-related $<p_{t}>$ fluctuations near 10 GeV.Download Free PDFView PDFAdvances in High Energy PhysicsSelected Experimental Results from Heavy-Ion Collisions at LHC2013 • Lokesh KumarDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
