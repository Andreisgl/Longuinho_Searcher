The complete and the aftershock-depleted catalogues with minimum magnitude M3 were investigated. Both seismic catalogues show multifractal characteristics. The aftershock-depleted catalogue is more multifractal and also more persistent than the whole catalogue; this indicates that aftershock magnitudes contribute to increase the homogeneity and the randomness of the magnitude sequence of the whole seismicity. The singularity spectrum of the whole catalogue, however, is more left-skewed than that of the aftershock-depleted one, indicating a stronger dependence of the multifractality on the large magnitude fluctuations.Download Free PDFView PDFNatural Hazards and Earth System SciencesMultifractal variability in geoelectrical signals and correlations with seismicity: a study case in southern Italy2005 • Luciano  TelescaDownload Free PDFView PDFPhysica A-statistical Mechanics and Its ApplicationsMultifractal fluctuations in seismic interspike series2005 • Luciano  TelescaDownload Free PDFView PDFChaos Solitons & FractalsMono and multi-fractal investigation of scaling properties in temporal patterns of seismic sequences2004 • Luciano  TelescaDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Statistical Mechanics-theory and Experiment - J STAT MECH-THEORY EXPAnalysis of the time dynamics in wind records by means of multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis and the Fisher-Shannon information plane2011 • michele lovalloThe time structure of more than 10 years of hourly wind data measured at one site in northern Italy from April 1996 to December 2007 is analysed. The data were recorded by the Sodar Rass system, which measures the speed and the direction of the wind at several heights above the ground level. To investigate the wind speed time series at seven heights above the ground level we used two different approaches: (i) multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MF-DFA), which permits the detection of multifractality in nonstationary series, and (ii) the Fisher-Shannon (FS) information plane, which allows the discrimination of dynamical features in complex time series. Our results point to the existence of multifractal time fluctuations in wind speed and to a dependence of the results on the height of the wind sensor. Even in the FS information plane a height-dependent pattern is revealed, indicating a good agreement with the multifractality. The obtained results could contribute to a better...Download Free PDFView PDFTectonophysicsMultifractal investigation of continuous seismic signal recorded at El Hierro volcano (Canary Islands) during the 2011–2012 pre- and eruptive phases2015 • Rafael MelendezDownload Free PDFView PDFTemporal and Spatial Variations of Seismicity during the 1998 Hida Mountain Earthquake Swarms, Central Honshu, Japan Preliminary ResultsKiyoshi ItoSynopsis We analyze the spatio-temporal distribution of b-value in the frequency-magnitude relation of earthquakes, for the 1998-1999 Hida Mountain earthquake swarms. We found a b-value that varies from 0.8 to 1.5-1.7 when depth is increasing from 4 to 6km. The high b- value is located in a crustal region that is characterized, according to some previous studies, by low-velocity and low-density. The results suggest that the b-value can be a useful tool for mapping such &quot;anomalous&quot; areas, possibly associated with magma movements. Our study confirms other similar investigations in volcanic areas.Download Free PDFView PDFMultifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis of Seismic Induced Radon-222 Time SeriesHirok  Chaudhuri" Multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MFDFA) " is a relatively new technique in the domain of nonlinear analysis and widely used to bring out the information hidden in a time series data. The essence of MFDFA lies in overcoming various restrictions or limitations of the " detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) " technique. In the present paper, we have applied MFDFA technique on soil radon-222 time series with an aim to understand the underlying dynamics of seismic induced soil gas anomaly. Several, multifractal parameters especially the generalized Hurst exponent, scaling exponent as well as the multifractal spectrum of the soil radon-222 time series were figured out. Results show that soil radon-222 time series data consists of several nonlinear features such as fractal structures, long range correlation etc. which may have originated out of a wide range of perturbations generated by seismic induced physico-chemical disturbances within the earth's crust. The estimated local fluctuations or root mean square (RMS) values greatly assist to figure out the anomalous pattern present in the said radon-222 time series. The MFDFA technique seems to be prospective in earthquake precursor study.Download Free PDFView PDFThe essence of multifractal detrended fluctuation technique to explore the dynamics of soil radon precursor for earthquakesHirok  Chaudhuri, Argha DebThe present paper deals with the application of multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis technique on soil radon-222 time series data recorded at Earthquake Precursory Observatory at TattaPani, Jammu and Kashmir, India. The earth being a complicated dynamic system composed of diverse rock types subjected to spatially varying stress patterns, understanding seismic activity-induced soil gas anomaly in such a complex scenario calls for using nonlinear statistical techniques. Therefore, we have adopted several multifractal parameters especially the generalised Hurst exponent, scaling exponent as well as the multifractal spectrum of the radon time series to the problem. A 2-month data (November 5 to December 31, 2012) on soil radon taken at 10-min interval show a wide variation from 2.34 to 58.99 kBq/m 3 with four prominent fluctuations ([mean ± 2r). The data consists of several nonlinear features such as fractal structures and long-range correlation. The observed nonlinear characteristics are pointed to seismic-induced physico-chemical instability within the earth's interior. The estimated local fluctuations or root mean square values greatly assist to distinguish the anomalous pattern present in the recorded time series data.Download Free PDFView PDFNatural Hazards and Earth System SciencesMultifractality in local geomagnetic field at Etna volcano, Sicily (southern Italy2005 • Gilda CurrentiDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
