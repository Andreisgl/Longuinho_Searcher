Using a combination of imaging techniques and atomic absorption spectroscopy, we describe a link between root phenotype and micro-nutrient concentration in cassava, which could enable new phenotypic selection strategies for breeding. This approach could be used with existing breeding infrastructure to enhance the micronutrient concentration of cassava and hence, benefit the health of people, particularly in low-income countries where cassava is consumed as a staple crop. Summary • Cassava storage roots are a staple food in low-income countries of SouthEast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, where growth stunting is prevalent as a consequence of micronutrient deficiencies. We aim to link phenotypes of field-grown cassava roots to micronutrient concentration in the edible storage roots as a simple way to improve phenotypic selection for nutritional value in cassava. • We used existing and newly developed imaging techniques to quantify root phenotypes of the cassava root architecture over time and used flame atomic absorption spectroscopy to measure micronutrient concentration in storage roots. Both together allow the association of root phenotypes with micronutrient concentration in mature cassava roots. • We show that early and late bulking genotypes in cassava exhibit distinct foraging behaviors that are associated with micronutrient concentration in the edible storage root. Our observations suggest that late bulking cassava is a key to provide sufficient micronutrients in the edible storage root. • The association between root phenotype and micronutrient concentration with imaging techniques allows phenotypic selection for enhanced micronutrient concentration. Therefore, implementing image-based phenotyping into cassava breeding programs in sub-Saharan Africa and SouthEast Asia could be an essential element to resolve micronutrient deficiencies that puts individuals at a higher risk of growth stunting.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
From lab to field: Open tools facilitating the translation of maize root traitsby Alexander Bucksch and March SalungyuField Crops Research,  2020Variation of root traits is associated with soil resource acquisition under abiotic stresses.

However, plant breeding programs targeting beneficial root traits are hampered by lacking appropriate phenotyping tools. The availability of high-throughput root phenotyping technologies for seedlings as well as for mature plants grown in the field enabled us to investigate trait translation from the lab to the field. Here we used the established phenotyping techniques Rhizoslides, Shovelomics, and the image-based root phenotyping software, Digital Imaging of Root Traits (DIRT) to phenotype root traits of thirty seedlings and mature maize donor lines from the Drought Tolerance Maize for Africa (DTMA) project. The experiments were carried out in a controlled-environment and a field trial under well-watered and drought conditions. We found significant correlation between seedlings seminal and crown root number in the field (r = 0.68). Primary root branching of seedlings was negatively correlated with crown root branching of field-grown plants (r=-0.54). Our study showed indirect translation of traits between primary root length (r = 0.29) and primary root branching (r = 0.20) with plant performance in the field under drought. Our results suggest that root traits of maize seedlings are predictive for mature maize root traits and plant performance in the field. Our findings suggest that using open tools for high-throughput root phenotyping to screen in maize seedling could be beneficial for breeding programs and paves a cost-efficient way for plant improvement and breeding programs in developing countries.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
COMPARING PHENOTYPIC VARIATION OF ROOT TRAITS IN THAI RICE (ORYZA SATIVA L.)

Abstract. Root systems have long been neglected in plant breeding due to their inaccessibility and the laborious nature of root studies. Over the past years, root scientists developed the classification system, methodologies and growing systems for high throughput measurements of root traits. We compared root traits obtained with three growing systems for eleven Thai rice varieties. We found considerable differences in the variation of root traits between the laboratory system with paper roll-up, a pot system in the greenhouse and a field system. The variation of root traits ranged from 1.31 folds in root cortical aerenchyma (RCA) to 4.20 folds in crown root growth angle in a roll-up system. Varieties also differed in root plasticity among the three growing environments. Principal components analysis indicated that root anatomical traits contributed 55% to the observed variation in the field. Hierarchical cluster analysis revealed that upland varieties clustered in a steep-angled group while lowland varieties clustered in a shallow-angled group. The observed clustering could be linked to the amount of RCA. Our results suggest that optimization of root growth angle could be an important strategy for improved adaptation of rice plants growing in flooded and non-flooded areas. We propose Thai rice varieties as donors in root trait driven breeding programs to enhance water and nutrient uptake.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Editorial: Optical Approaches to Capture Plant Dynamics in Time, Space, and Across Scales Editorial on the Research Topic Optical Approaches to Capture Plant Dynamics in Time, Space, and Across Scales Frontiers in Plant Science,  2018The quest to decipher the phenotype to genotype relationships involves the quantification of plan... more The quest to decipher the phenotype to genotype relationships involves the quantification of plant adaption to the environment at various scales to solve some of the world's most pressing problems (Bucksch et al., 2017). The role of phenotype to genotype relationships within initiatives to increase crop yields for food, fiber, and fuel and to improve prediction of future environmental conditions (IPCC, 2014) is central to the function and well-being of societies worldwide. Quantifying plant morphology over time captures the dynamic structure and function relationships of how plants interact with and respond to environmental stimuli (Balduzzi et al., 2017). A deeper understanding of plant adaption can be achieved if technologies to monitor plants across spatial and biological scales are further developed. Spanning biological scales from the community over the organismal down to the molecular scale is inherently coupled to spatial scales. A wide variety of technological concepts are facilitating the revival of the science of plant morphology and anatomy (Ledford, 2018). Over the last decades, optical imaging and remote sensing developed the fundamental working tools to monitor and quantify our environment and plants in particular. Satellite imaging increased its spatial, temporal, and spectral resolution to levels where individual trees in forests can be partly identified. However, it remains a challenge to develop pipelines that quantify the traits of plants and their processes from the level of plant populations down to the detail obtained with microscopy. The reason for the pipeline challenge is the heterogeneity of the obtained data ranging from unorganized point clouds over surface models to rasterized imaging and hyperspectral data. For example, airborne methods increased their importance in ecology by measuring aggregate tree traits such as crown width or stem diameter to study community composition (Wieser et al., 2017). However, combining airborne and high-resolution terrestrial data is non-trivial despite improved automatization and higher resolutions of measured plant traits. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) equipped with cameras and multispectral sensors allow the fusion of temporal, spatial, and spectral data to record plant dynamics on ecosystem level at resolutions that also allow the quantification of individual plant morphology.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Therefore, understanding the relationship between root traits and environmental factors is essential for improving N and water acquisition. A field experiment was conducted in the semi-arid region of the Loess Plateau in northwestern China to quantify the architectural and anatomical root traits of maize (Zea mays L.) in response to plastic film mulching and N fertilization. We compared four treatments: non-mulching with and without N supply as well as plastic film mulching with and without N supply. Variation existed for all root architecture and anatomy traits within maize root crowns. Crown and brace root angles to the soil line decreased in response to film mulching and N fertilization. Crown roots under plastic film mulching showed a significantly decreased distance to branching, reduced lateral root length, and overall increased root diameter. Similarly, N application significantly decreased the distance to branching, yet induced more compact and denser crown roots, and increased the root diameter. Brace roots exhibited an increased distance to branching, greater lateral root length and density, as well as a larger root diameter in response to plastic film mulching and N fertilization. Additionally, the accumulated number of nodal roots increased greatly under plastic film mulching and N treatments. At the anatomical level, N application reduced the proportion of the root cortical aerenchyma area. In contrast, aerenchyma area, cortex cell size, and late metaxylem vessel diameter were increased as a result of plastic film mulching. These results demonstrate root architectural and anatomical traits respond to mulching practices and N fertilization.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Yet CIP usability, functionality, and growth does not scale with the sum of these resources.  Instead, growth and efficient usage of CIPs requires access to “hidden” resources.  These hidden resources include technical resources within CIPs as well as social and functional interactions amongst stakeholders. We identify approaches to overcome resource limitations following the conceptual basis of Liebig’s Law of the Minimum.  In so doing, we recommend practical steps towards efficient and scaleable resource use given the iPlant/CyVerse CIP as an example.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

A major hurdle in developing these metrics is finding common terminology across fields. In this review, we define approaches for analyzing plant geometry, topology, and shape, and provide examples for how these terms have been and can be applied to plants. In leaf morphological quantifications both geometry and shape have been used to gain insight into leaf function and evolution. For the analysis of cell growth and expansion, we highlight the utility of geometric descriptors for understanding sepal and hypocotyl development. For branched structures, we describe how topology has been applied to quantify root system architecture to lend insight into root function. Lastly, we discuss the importance of using morphological descriptors in ecology to assess how communities interact, function, and respond within different environments. This review aims to provide a basic description of the mathematical principles underlying morphological quantifications.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Genetic variation of particular root architectural phenes of common bean is associated with improved acquisition of water and phosphorus. Quantitative evaluation of root architectural phenotypes of mature plants in the field is challenging Nonetheless, in situ phenotyping captures responses to environmental variation and is critical to improving crop performance in the target environment. The objective of this study was to develop flexible high-throughput root architectural phenotyping platforms for bean and cowpea, which have distinct but comparable root architectures. The bean phenotyping platform was specifically designed to scale from the lab to the field. Initial laboratory studies revealed cowpea does not have basal root whorls so the cowpea phenotypic platform was taken directly to field evaluation. Protocol development passed through several stages including comparisons of lab to field quantification systems and comparing manual and image-based phenotyping tools of field grown roots. Comparing lab-grown bean seedlings and field measurements at pod elongation stage resulted in a R 2 of 0.66 for basal root whorl number (BRWN) and 0.92 for basal root number (BRN) between lab and field observations. Visual ratings were found to agree well with manual measurements for 12 root parameters of common bean. Heritability for 51 traits ranged from zero to eighty-three, with greatest heritability for BRWN and least for disease and secondary branching traits. Heritability for cow-pea traits ranged from 0.01 to 0.80 to with number of large hypocotyl roots (1.5A) being most heritable, nodule score (NS) and tap root diameter at 5 cm (TD5) being moderately heritable and tap root diameter 15 cm below the soil level (TD15) being least heritable. Two minutes per root crown were required to evaluate 12 root phene descriptors manually and image analysis required 1 h to analyze 5000 images for 39 phenes. Manual and image-based platforms can differentiate field-grown genotypes on the basis of these traits. We suggest an integrated protocol combining visual scoring, manual measurements, and image analysis. The integrated phenotyping platform presented here has utility for identifying and selecting useful root architectural phenotypes for bean and cowpea and potentially extends to other annual legume or dicotyledonous crops.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Cowpea root architecture has agronomic impactCowpea productivity is constrained by abiotic and biotic soil conditions including drought, low f... more Cowpea productivity is constrained by abiotic and biotic soil conditions including drought, low fertility and root parasites.  These resources and constraints occur in a heterogeneous and stratified pattern.  Selection and breeding for beneficial root traits can improve acquisition of soil resources, avoidance of parasites and hence crop production in marginal environments.  The present study presents results from two seasons of manual root architectural phenotyping (shovelomics) and one season of automated image phenotyping (DIRT) on a 189 entry diversity panel of cowpea grown in the field in Limpopo, South Africa. Significant variation in root phenes was quantified and relatively high heritability was found for several root traits accessed manually as well as repeatability for traits accessed via DIRT.  GWAS identified seven significant QTL from manually scored root architecture and 19 root architecture QTL scored from image analysis. Subsequent comparisons of results from the present root architecture study with other field studies revealed QTL co-localizations between root traits and performance indicators including yield, stay green, and Striga resistance.  The utility of the two root architectural phenotyping tools is demonstrated by revealing biologically important variation and genetic regions controlling root architecture. The data suggest root trait selection could be incorporated into breeding programs to increase production in challenging environments.  Root architectural studies of other legumes such as pigeon pea, fava bean, chickpea, and groundnut could make use of the same phenotyping tools and some initial studies have already been conducted.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

For the analysis of cell growth and expansion, we highlight the utility of geometric descriptors for understanding sepal and hypocotyl development. For branched structures, we describe how topology has been applied to quantify root system architecture to lend insight into root function. Lastly, we discuss the importance of using morphological descriptors in ecology to assess how communities interact, function, and respond within different environments. This review aims to provide a basic description of the mathematical principles underlying morphological quantifications.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Legume shovelomics: High—Throughput phenotyping of commonbean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata subsp,unguiculata) root architecture in the fieldLow phosphorus (P) availability and drought are primary constraints to common bean and cowpea pro... more Low phosphorus (P) availability and drought are primary constraints to common bean and cowpea production in developing countries. Genetic variation of particular root architectural phenes of common bean is associated with improved acquisition of water and phosphorus. Quantitative evaluation of root architectural phenotypes of mature plants in the field is challenging Nonetheless, in situ phenotyping captures responses to environmental variation and is critical to improving crop performance in the target environment. The objective of this study was to develop flexible high-throughput root architectural phenotyping platforms for bean and cowpea, which have distinct but comparable root architectures. The bean phenotyping platform was specifically designed to scale from the lab to the field. Initial laboratory studies revealed cowpea does not have basal root whorls so the cowpea phenotypic platform was taken directly to field evaluation. Protocol development passed through several stages including comparisons of lab to field quantification systems and comparing manual and image-based phenotyping tools of field grown roots. Comparing lab-grown bean seedlings and field measurements at pod elongation stage resulted in a R 2 of 0.66 for basal root whorl number (BRWN) and 0.92 for basal root number (BRN) between lab and field observations. Visual ratings were found to agree well with manual measurements for 12 root parameters of common bean. Heritability for 51 traits ranged from zero to eighty-three, with greatest heritability for BRWN and least for disease and secondary branching traits. Heritability for cow-pea traits ranged from 0.01 to 0.80 to with number of large hypocotyl roots (1.5A) being most heritable, nodule score (NS) and tap root diameter at 5 cm (TD5) being moderately heritable and tap root diameter 15 cm below the soil level (TD15) being least heritable. Two minutes per root crown were required to evaluate 12 root phene descriptors manually and image analysis required 1 h to analyze 5000 images for 39 phenes. Manual and image-based platforms can differentiate field-grown genotypes on the basis of these traits. We suggest an integrated protocol combining visual scoring, manual measurements, and image analysis. The integrated phenotyping platform presented here has utility for identifying and selecting useful root architectural phenotypes for bean and cowpea and potentially extends to other annual legume or dicotyledonous crops.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Cowpea root architecture has agronomic impactCowpea productivity is constrained by abiotic and biotic soil conditions including drought, low f... more Cowpea productivity is constrained by abiotic and biotic soil conditions including drought, low fertility and root parasites.  These resources and constraints occur in a heterogeneous and stratified pattern.  Selection and breeding for beneficial root traits can improve acquisition of soil resources, avoidance of parasites and hence crop production in marginal environments.  The present study presents results from two seasons of manual root architectural phenotyping (shovelomics) and one season of automated image phenotyping (DIRT) on a 189 entry diversity panel of cowpea grown in the field in Limpopo, South Africa. Significant variation in root phenes was quantified and relatively high heritability was found for several root traits accessed manually as well as repeatability for traits accessed via DIRT.  GWAS identified seven significant QTL from manually scored root architecture and 19 root architecture QTL scored from image analysis. Subsequent comparisons of results from the present root architecture study with other field studies revealed QTL co-localizations between root traits and performance indicators including yield, stay green, and Striga resistance.  The utility of the two root architectural phenotyping tools is demonstrated by revealing biologically important variation and genetic regions controlling root architecture. The data suggest root trait selection could be incorporated into breeding programs to increase production in challenging environments.  Root architectural studies of other legumes such as pigeon pea, fava bean, chickpea, and groundnut could make use of the same phenotyping tools and some initial studies have already been conducted.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Localized Registration of Point Clouds of Botanic Treesby Alexander Bucksch and Kourosh KhoshelhamIEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters,  2000Abstract A global registration is often insufficient for estimating dendrometric characteristics ... more Abstract A global registration is often insufficient for estimating dendrometric characteristics of trees because individual branches of the same tree may exhibit different positions between two scanning procedures. Therefore, we introduce a localized approach to register point clouds of botanic trees. Given two roughly registered point clouds $ hbox {PC} _ {1} $ and $ hbox {PC} _ {2} $ of a tree, we apply a skeletonization method to both point clouds. Based on these two skeletons, initial correspondences between branch segments of both ...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Revealing the skeleton from imperfect point cloudsQuantifying our surrounding environment in terms of sizes and orders has always been of interest,... more Quantifying our surrounding environment in terms of sizes and orders has always been of interest, because it enables us to visualize, describe and interpret our environment. In the last decade terrestrial laser scanners became available as a tool to measure objects in our surrounding environment. Terrestrial laser scanning samples surfaces with millions of 3D points to be stored as a point cloud. These point clouds contain information of sizes and orders of the sampled objects.Recently, trees became an object of high interest, because they contain a rich and complex structure, which is to be exploited in terms of branch length, branch diameter and branching hierarchy. Such information can be used for forestry, hydrology, ecology and visualization applications.This thesis introduces the SkelTre algorithm (Skeletonization of Trees) as a method to extract a structure description from point clouds. Such a structure description is a socalled skeleton which is similar to a collection of connected lines. A skeleton enables us to extract the branching hierarchy and the size parameters of tree branches from point clouds. Laser scanned point clouds contain only information about the surface of a scanned object and no information about its inside. One benefit of SkelTre is its ability to extract a skeleton purely from the surface samples represented in the point cloud.The SkelTre algorithm meets four main requirements explicitly:1. Topological preservance - to enable the branching hierarchy extraction2. Metric representation - to enable the measurement of sizes3. Imperfect data handling - to address data characteristics such as noise, underampling and varying point density4. Computational efficiency - to address the need for fast data processing on the given huge amount of dataThe SkelTre algorithm treats all four requirements based on one single characteristic, the local elongation direction. This elongation direction describes locally how an object surface is sizing in a 3D space. A local elongation direction can be extracted from the given imperfect data by analyzing small cubical cells subdividing the point cloud into a 3D raster. The cubical cells are derived from a so-called octree subdivision. For each cell it is analyzed which side of the cell is passed by the point cloud. The passed sides are representing the local elongations which are further represented by a graph. In this graph, each cell is corresponding to a vertex. If cells share a passed side, than the corresponding vertices are linked by an edge.The input point cloud is imperfect, because it contains noise, undersampling and varying point densities. Therefore, SkelTre treats these point cloud characteristics explicitly, to produce a result that is correctly representing the branching hierarchy. Therefore, before the graph is reduced to the skeleton a robustness criterion is applied. This criterion removes and adds edges to the graph. Edges are added on locations where data is missing because of undersampling or removed when noise causes unintended edges. At this stage the graph ideally represents the surface of an object and is to be reduced to a skeleton.This corrected graph is then reduced to a skeleton by a set of newly developed rules. The reduction uses two suited vertex configurations occurring in the graph, so-called E-Pairs and V-Pairs. Basically the reduction relies on the property, that whenever an E-Pair is found and reduced, one or more V-Pairs are generated. Processing of a V-Pair leads to either new V-Pairs or otherwise a new E-Pair has to be found in the graph. If neither an E-Pair or a V-Pair is present in the graph it is ensured that the result is a skeleton. The resulting skeleton is related to a known topological structure, the Reeb-Graph.During the reduction of the graph, the graph is embedded into the point cloud such that every vertex is locally centered within the point cloud. The correct branching order and centeredness enables the navigation to a chosen location in the point cloud to derive a branch diameter. A first implementation of the algorithm is given to demonstrate its efficiency on huge point cloud data. On many examples it is evaluated, that all four requirements are met. These examples include non-tree objects to emphasize the generality of the introduced skeletonization framework.The practical use of the SkelTre algorithm is demonstrated on two applications demanding automatic size measurements on trees. In contrast to older methods, both applications do not rely on pre-knowledge of the tree species. Hence, the assessment of trees in these applications is purely based on the point cloud data. Both applications use the newly developed HARPER method to estimate the diameter under support of the SkelTre skeleton. The HARPER method estimates the diameter of a branch on the basis of the double distance of the point cloud points to the skeleton. The length of branches is derived as the sum of the edge lengths in the skeleton of a branch.The first application is the automatic estimation of the tree parameters branch length and branch diameter from laser scanned orchard trees. The estimated parameters are a key to understand a number of physiological processes in the tree canopy. Furthermore, these parameters are useful to determine the vitality of a tree. Orchard trees are optimized by branch cuttings to maximize the crop load on the tree. These cuttings destroy the growth pattern of the tree. Therefore, assumptions about the growth pattern can not be made for the estimation of the branch sizes. For these orchard trees the branch length and diameter was derived with the HARPER method. High correlations above 0.9 between field and automatic measurement were found in the frequency distributions of the branch length and diameter classes. These results show that automatic measurement of tree parameters from terrestrial laser scans is possible.The second application demonstrates a possible future use of the SkelTre skeleton. Here, the skeletonization was applied to airborne obtained laser point clouds to estimate the trunk diameter at breast height (1,30m). The diameter at breast height is one key parameter for calculating hydrological roughness in flooding areas and to estimate the woody volume of a tree. The density of airborne obtained point clouds is only 75 points per square meter. Still, the trunk diameter at breast height could be extracted. On simulated airborne scanned trees a correlation of 0.97 was achieved between the diameter at breast height of the known simulated trees and the HARPER method. Furthermore, test cases were extracted from the airborne obtained point cloud of the recently updated Actual Height Model of the Netherlands, AHN2. On these test cases the estimated diameter with the HARPER method deviated less than a standard cylinder fitting method from manually measured diameters in the field. Still, the validation of a whole forest remains difficult, because not all trees of the forest are found back in the AHN2 point cloud. Such AHN2 point clouds will be available for the whole Netherlands in 2013 and other countries collect similar point clouds at this time. The wide availability of such point clouds in future underlines the relevance of this application.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The geometries of leaves and flowers and intricate topologies of the root have fascinated plant biologists and mathematicians alike. Beyond providing aesthetic inspiration, understanding plant morphology has become pressing in an era of climate change and a growing population. Gaining an understanding of how to modify plant architecture through molecular biology and breeding is critical to improving agriculture, and the monitoring of ecosystems and global vegetation is vital to modeling a future with fewer natural resources. In this white paper, we begin by summarizing the rich history and state of the art in quantifying the form of plants, mathematical models of patterning in plants, and how plant morphology manifests dynamically across disparate scales of biological organization. We then explore the fundamental challenges that remain unanswered concerning plant morphology, from the barriers preventing the prediction of phenotype from genotype to modeling the fluttering of leaves in a light breeze. We end with a discussion concerning the education of plant morphology synthesizing biological and mathematical approaches and ways to facilitate research advances through outreach, cross-disciplinary training, and open science. Never has the need to model plant morphology been more imperative. Unleashing the potential of geometric and topological approaches in the plant sciences promises to transform our understanding of both plants and mathematics.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

N. ... more We present a novel growth phenomenon in N. crassa identified using microfluidic technologies. N. crassa cells form a complex web-like network through hyphal extension, branching, and fusion. Our preliminary data indicate that after this filamentous network has been established, bursts of tree-like structures build upon these pre-existing network tracks. These trees grow rapidly, branch highly, and remain localized to particular segments of the network. The goal of this work is to use microfluidic technology as a tool for uncovering the genetic mechanisms dictating formation of these tree-like structures following filamentous network formation in N. crassa. This work will provide insights into cell-cell communication, social behavior, and response to glucose availability through foraging.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

As, such plant morphology is an unresolved mystery to plant biologists, who seek to understand the molecular mechanisms by which such predetermined patterns emerge as a consequence of genes, environments and the interactions of both. A quantitative understanding of the functions that patterns fulfill enable a new unimproved potential for plant breeding as well as characherize current climate models on a finer spatial scale.

Automated phenotyping of root hair traits from microscopy imagesby Peter Pietrzyk, Chartinun Chutoe, Patompong  Saengwilai, and Alexander BuckschImproving nutrient and water uptake in crops is one of the major challenges to sustain a fast-gro... more Improving nutrient and water uptake in crops is one of the major challenges to sustain a fast-growing population that faces increasingly nutrient limited soils. Root hairs, which are specialized epidermal cells, compromise up to 70% of the total root surface area. Therefore, it is likely that root hairs are important for nutrient uptake from the soil. Microscopy provides a mean to record root hairs as digital images. However, quantifying root hairs in microscopy images remains a bottleneck because of a high degree of geometric complexity in their spatial arrangement. We present a methodology to automatically quantify phenotypic traits of root hairs in digital microscopy images. Our method uses a machine learning approach that is trained to classify root hair versus other root components and the image’s background. Image statistics of 20 training images are used to automatically classify root hair images taken with the same imaging protocol. Since root hairs may cross each other or form blobs of two or more hairs, we define metrics to distinguish these cases computationally. As a result, we measure the root hair traits number, length, density, diameter, orientation and overall complexity. We investigate root hair traits of rice, maize and common bean, under water and nitrogen stress. First tests with the new machine learning method suggest that our measured traits distinguish between genotypes and treatments in our study and pave the way towards identifying the genetic control of root hair traits.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
