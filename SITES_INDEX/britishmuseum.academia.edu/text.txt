Michael LewisThe British Museum,  Learning and Audiences,  Head of Portable Antiquities & Treasure +2The British Museum, Learning and Audiences, Head of Portable Antiquities & TreasureUniversity of Reading, Arts & Humanities, Visiting FellowUniversity of York, Archaeology, Research AssociateAnglo-Norman England+18Michael is Head of Portable Antiquities & Treasure at the British Museum and Visiting Professor in Archaeology at the University of Reading. He has an interest in medieval metal small finds, particularly those associated with everyday life and religious practice, but is best know for his research on the Bayeux Tapestry; he is a member of the Bayeux Tapestry Scientific Committee, and working on the loan of the Tapestry to the UK in 2023/4.His current research projects include: 'medieval markets and PAS data' (with O Okansen), 'medieval pilgrim badges and their use', 'Limoges enamels', and 'medieval and post-medieval vervels' (with Richardson).He is currently supervising three PhDs: Rob Webley (York, with Dr Ashby and Dr McClain) 'Characterising Portable Metalwork in Late Anglo-Saxon and Anglo-Norman England'; Naomi Speakman (Courtauld Institute, with Prof Lowden) 'Gothic Ivories in the British Museum'; Lloyd de Beer (University of East Anglia, with Prof Heslop) 'Alabaster Carvings of Medieval England in Context'.He is a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London, a Member of the Chartered Institute for Archaeologists, and a Freeman of the Worshipful Company of Art Scholars.  Michael was the 'expert' on HISTORY's Mud Men (series 2 & 3), examining all the finds found by 'Mud God' Steve Brooker and his 'apprentice' Johnny Vaughan.Phone: (+44) 0207 323 8611Address: Portable Antiquities Scheme, British Museum, London, WC1B 3DGless386 Followers108 Following21 Co-authorsTotal Views ;FollowFollowingCVall7 New Publications6 Conference Abstracts10 Portable Antiquities Scheme2 Early Medieval Archaeology9 Medieval ArchaeologyMore  5 Bayeux Tapestry5 Post Medieval Archaeology PAS roundups2 Classifications3 Talks2 Conference PresentationsNew PublicationsThe Story of the Bayeux Tapestry - unravelling the Norman ConquestPolitical intrigue and treachery, heroism and brutal violence, victory and defeat – all this is d... more Political intrigue and treachery, heroism and brutal violence, victory and defeat – all this is depicted in the Bayeux Tapestry, an epic account of one of the pivotal episodes in English history embroidered on a strip of linen. Famously, it shows the stricken Anglo-Saxon king Harold dying on the battlefield of Hastings in 1066 amid a shower of arrows, as axes clash, spears fly and fallen warriors are trampled beneath charging hooves. However, there is much more to this remarkable historical and artistic treasure, which tells its tale with an intensity and immediacy that speak to our modern world, almost 1,000 years after its creation. Many mysteries and questions still surround this unique embroidery and not all is as it might appear at first glance. Who made it, when, why, where and what for? David Musgrove and Michael Lewis set the events depicted in the context of the machinations on either side of the English Channel in the years leading up to the Norman Conquest, and tease out what the Tapestry tells us of the deeds of kings as well as aspects of everyday life in medieval Europe. A complete and accessible up-to-date account, illustrated throughout in colour with new photography, this is the definitive guide to the Bayeux Tapestry and its legacy, exploring the rich narrative behind its stitches and the turbulent times in which it was created.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This response paper contests the basic assumptions upon which this analysis is based. While Hardy‘s comparative, quantitative approach is laudable, it is founded in a biased and simplistic outlook on the metal detecting phenomenon.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The Bayeux Tapestry: window to a word of continuity and changeThe Bayeux Tapestry provides a window onto a world of continuity and change, and is not just a pi... more The Bayeux Tapestry provides a window onto a world of continuity and change, and is not just a pictorial narrative of a recent historical event. Its Norman patron no doubt wished to celebrate the Norman achievement, but felt it necessary to do so in a manner sensitive to the political complexities of time; at the time the Tapestry was produced the Anglo-Norman state was still fragile and sought assimilation as much as domination. As a craft of English renown, embroidery was a significant choice for this masterpiece. Not only did this highlight Norman appreciation of Anglo-Saxon craft-work, but embroidery was a medium that lent itself to the production of a large scale and complicated narrative sequences, also drawing upon an art historical tradition more apparent in extant Anglo-Saxon illuminations of Biblical events. Indeed, the nature of the commission provided its (probable) English designer with challenges, which he had to overcome with imagination and inventiveness, again reflecting the unique nature of the Anglo-Norman period as one of both continuity and change.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

For the archeological museums in particular the challenge is overwhelming, claiming resources for recording, preservation and storing this apparently ever growing supply. Avoiding creating orphaned archaeological collections, museums and researchers are deeply concerned with the difficulties and opportunities when transforming material gathered by a conscientious public into a useful source for both scholars and the public. For the amateurs, the image of metal detection as a scrupulous treasury hunt has changed to into a hobby that has responsibilities. For the professional archaeologists, changing what some has called " an uncontrollable threat " into a proper study of the past has been demanding. Papers may explore efforts done to build a relationship between archaeologists and metal-detector users over the past fifty years and also how collaborations between the archaeological and the metal-detecting communities have developed. Papers discussing the use of artefacts found by non-professional metal detecting in research, exhibition and outreach activities are very welcome.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Since then over 850,000 objects have been recorded ranging in date from the Palaeolithic to Early Modern times, which are publicly available via its online database providing a large and important resource for archaeologists and members of the public. This talk has two aims. Firstly, it will look at the UK legislation regarding the reporting of and the practical issues of liaising with metal-detectorists and others to record these finds through the Portable Antiquities Scheme. Secondly, it will illustrate the contribution this dataset is making to our understanding of Britain’s past, through highlighting important new discoveries; the contribution these finds have for archaeological knowledge; and by exploring how this data is being used by archaeologists and other researchers.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In particular, distributional patterns of these data are analysed to examineissues of movement and variation in usage. For example, suggestions are given for the lack of material evidence forsome cults, such as that of St Winefride, considering the possibility that a quantity of pilgrim souvenirs were eitherorganic or were naturally occurring. Also discussed are broader cultural trends across the medieval religious landscape,as well as directions for future study.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
