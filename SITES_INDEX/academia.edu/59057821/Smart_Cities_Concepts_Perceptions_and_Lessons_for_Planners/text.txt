However, definitions of "smart" cities remain elusive, and an inadequate understanding may lead cities to possible image or technological traps, heavy investments in ICTs and infrastructure without maximizing their potential, or to focus on "smart" technologies for short-term solutions without adequately considering the long term. As cities grapple with rapid urbanization and goals for sustainable development, resource management and climate change mitigation, learning about being "smart" will be timely and invaluable for planners. This study examines six "smart" cities -Boston, San Francisco, Amsterdam, Stockholm, Singapore and Rio de Janeiroassessing city officials' perceptions and concepts of "smart cities" and their "smart" initiatives. Their efforts and approaches are analyzed against four theories of "smart"...See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersThe Role of Smart City Characteristics in the Plans of Fifteen CitiesMargarita AngelidouThis paper identifies the characteristics of smart cities as they emerge from the recent literature. It then examines whether and in what way these characteristics are present in the smart city plans of 15 cities: Amsterdam, Barcelona, London, PlanIT Valley, Stockholm, Cyberjaya, Singapore, King Abdullah Economic City, Masdar, Skolkovo, Songdo, Chicago, New York, Rio de Janeiro, and Konza. The results are presented with respect to each smart city characteristic. As expected, most strategies emphasize the role of information and communication technologies in improving the functionality of urban systems and advancing knowledge transfer and innovation networks. However, this research yields other interesting findings that may not yet have been documented across multiple case studies; for example, most smart city strategies fail to incorporate bottom-up approaches, are poorly adapted to accommodate the local needs of their area, and consider issues of privacy and security inadequately.Download Free PDFView PDFCritical Planning (pp. 145-165)The Vanishing Poor: Frontier Narratives in New York City’s Gentrification and Security Debates2013 • Sonja SchillingsDownload Free PDFView PDFInternational Journal of Scientific Research in Computer Science, Engineering and Information TechnologyDeveloping a Smart City Essentials, Execution and Evaluationkazeem AbubakarAdoption of Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs) especially the internet is becoming the largest delivery podium for providing public and private services to the rural and urban populace. This paper adopted the Narrative Textual Case Study (NTCS) using qualitative approach to conduct content analysis of relevant literature. The study observed that over 50% of mankind occupies urban spaces and this will increase to two third by 2050. This situation is as a result of the opportunities that are available in the cities and it spells great challenges on environment, energy need, waste management, etc. Cities are responsible for nearly three quarters of greenhouse gases worldwide and must be seen to be a solution providers too. Hence to maintain high standard of living for the long term cities as well as nations must reduce ecological footprint and seek alternatives to scarce fossil resources. This requires comprehensive development of physical, institutional, social and eco...Download Free PDFView PDFBig Data and Smart (Equitable) CitiesMai T NguyenElected officials and bureaucrats claim that Big Data is dramatically changing city hall by allowing more efficient and effective decision-making. This has sparked a rise in the number of " Offices of Innovation " that collect, manage, use and share Big Data, in major cities throughout the U.S. This paper seeks to answer two questions. First, is Big Data changing how decisions are made in city hall? Second, is Big Data being used to address social equity and how? This study examines Offices of Innovation that use Big Data in five major American cities: New York, Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia, and Louisville, focusing specifically on three dimensions of Big Data and social equity: data democratization, digital access and literacy, and promoting equitable outcomes. Furthermore, this study highlights innovative practices that address social problems in order to provide directions for future research and practice on the topic of Big Data and social equity.Download Free PDFView PDFSmart-city-policies-A-spatial-approach 2014 CitiesRichard VermeerenDownload Free PDFView PDFSmart city policies: a spatial approach (2014)Margarita AngelidouThis paper reviews the factors which differentiate policies for the development smart cities, in an effort to provide a clear view of the strategic choices that come forth when mapping out such a strategy. The paper commences with a review and categorization of four strategic choices with a spatial reference, on the basis of the recent smart city literature and experience. The advantages and disadvantages of each strategic choice are presented. At the second part of the paper, the previous choices are illustrated though smart city strategy cases from all over the world. The third part of the paper includes recommendations for the development of smart cities based on the combined conclusions of the previous parts. The paper closes with a discussion of the insights that were provided and recommendations for future research areas.Download Free PDFView PDFCirculation in Computer ScienceThe Potentials and Challenges of Developing Smart Cities in AfricaMayuri Odedra-StraubThe rapid urbanization of African cities is one amongst other composite challenges hindering Africa’s objective to provide stable socio-economic development and delivery of quality livelihood for its citizens and visitors at large. The establishment of Smart City initiatives in African cities is meant to improve the quality of lives of the residents of those cities. Information and communications technologies (ICT) are key enabling factors for this transformation and must be integrated into several functional domains of society, such as health, education, transportation, energy, etc., so as to engender efficient and ubiquitous public services, as well as higher socio-economic standards of living for the citizens. This paper highlights the potential benefits, as well as challenges, African cities embarking on Smart City initiatives face. To further grasp the motivations and challenges of implementing Smart City initiatives in Africa, we take a look at a new Smart City initiative (The...Download Free PDFView PDFNew Public Institutional Forms and Social Innovation in Urban Governance: Insights from the "Mayor's Office of New Urban Mechanics" (MONUM) in Boston2019 • Guglielmo MinervinoThis paper investigates how public sector institutions change their form and approach to achieve a socially innovative urban governance. The "Mayor's Office of New Urban Mechanics" (MONUM) in Boston, Massachusetts (USA) proves a representative case of innovation in the public sector. As a new type of government agency, it is essentially an open innovation lab dedicated to innovative evidence-based policymaking. Following a new dynamic organizational pattern in urban governance, MONUM is conducive to project-oriented social innovation practices and horizontal multi-sectoral collaboration among the three societal sectors: public, private, and civil. Its results suggest that first, the peculiarity of MONUM lies in its hybrid and boundary-blurring nature. Second, new institutional forms that experiment with urban governance can rely on multi-sectoral collaboration. Third, MONUM has experimented with a systemic approach to social innovation following the "design thinking theory." The MONUM case can contribute to the current debate in Europe on the need to harmonize EU policies for an effective social inclusion by promoting the application of the place-sensitive approach.Download Free PDFView PDFCambridge Journal of Regions, Economy and SocietyCritical interventions into the corporate smart city2014 • Robert HollandsDownload Free PDFView PDFRESEARCH REPORT ON SMART CITY CENTRAL POLICY UNIT THE GOVERNMENT OF THE HONG KONG SPECIAL ADMINISTRATIVE REGIONAbdul  RazzaqDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
