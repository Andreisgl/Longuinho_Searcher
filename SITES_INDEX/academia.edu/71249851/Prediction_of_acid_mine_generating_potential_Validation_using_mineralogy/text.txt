Its prediction is very important for a proper management and rehabilitation of AMD generating sites. The Sobek test (1978) modified by Lawrence and Wang (1997) is the most used static test to predict the potential to generate AMD (particularly in North America). This method is compared in this work with mineralogy based static tests to evaluate the benefits of knowing the tailings mineralogy in AMD prediction. Three synthetic tailings composed of simple mixtures of well-characterized pure minerals are used. Although basically different in their principles and procedures, the modified Sobek test and mineralogy based static tests provide comparable results. The static prediction results are validated through the use of weathering cell kinetic tests.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersRevue de littérature détaillée sur les tests statiques et les essais cinétiques comme outils de prédiction du drainage minier acideHassan BouzahzahDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Geochemical ExplorationStatic tests response on 5 Canadian hard rock mine tailings with low net acid-generating potentials2012 • Mostafa BenzaazouaDownload Free PDFView PDFMineralsSpatial Mapping of Acidity and Geochemical Properties of Oxidized Tailings within the Former Eagle/Telbel Mine Siteabdellatif elghaliAt some orphaned and abandoned mine sites, acid mine drainage can represent a complex challenge due to the advanced tailings’ oxidation state as well as the combination of other factors. At the field scale, several parameters control sulfides’ oxidation rates and, therefore, the acidity generation. The objective of this paper is to map the acidity and geochemical properties of oxidized tailings within a closed tailings storage facility. Based on systematic sampling, various geochemical parameters were measured within the oxidized Joutel tailings, including the: Neutralization potential, acid-generating potential, net neutralization potential, neutralization potential ratio, paste pH, thickness of oxidized, hardpan, and transition zones. The different parameters were integrated in geographical information system (GISs) databases to quantify the spatial variability of the acidity and geochemical properties of oxidized tailings. The oxidized tailings were characterized by low sulfide (...Download Free PDFView PDFEnvironmental Science and Pollution ResearchUse of EDTA in modified kinetic testing for contaminated drainage prediction from waste rocks: case of the Lac Tio mine2015 • Mostafa BenzaazouaDownload Free PDFView PDFVERSION CORRIGÉE CORRECTED VERSION The influence of kinetic test type on the geochemical response of low acid generating potential tailings2000 • Mathieu Villeneuve, Michel Aubertin, Marcos MonroyThis paper presents a comparison of the geochemical responses of five different tailings submitted to five different kinetic tests. The five kinetic tests were done using column tests, humidity-cells, shaking flasks, modified Soxhlet extractors and mini-alteration cells. The different tailings have all AP values ranging from 23.9 to 178.8 kg CaCO3/t and NP values from 13.9 to 93.9 kg CaCO3/t.Download Free PDFView PDFMineralsDesulfurization of the Old Tailings at the Au-Ag-Cu Tiouit Mine (Anti-Atlas Morocco)Rachid HakkouTailings from the abandoned Tiouit mine site in Morocco are mainly composed of sulfides, hematite, and quartz. They contain 0.06–1.50 wt % sulfur, mostly in the form of pyrite, pyrrhotite, and chalcopyrite. The tailings also contain gold (3.36–5.00 ppm), silver (24–37 ppm), and copper (0.06–0.08 wt %). Flotation tests were conducted to reprocess the tailings for Au, Ag, and Cu recovery, and at the same time to prevent acid mine drainage (AMD) generation through the oxidation of sulfide minerals, including pyrite, sphalerite, arsenopyrite, chalcopyrite, galena. The flotation results confirmed that environmental desulfurization is effective at reducing the overall sulfide content in the tailings. The recovery of sulfides was between 69% and 75%, while Au recovery weight-yield was between 2.8% and 4.7%. The test that showed the best sulfur recovery rate and weight-yield was carried out with 100 g/t CuSO4 (sulfide activator) and 50 g/t of amyl xanthate (collector). The goal of this stud...Download Free PDFView PDFMineralsIncorporating Kinetic Modeling in the Development Stages of Hard Rock Mine Projectsyoussef toubriWeathering cell test, designed specifically to overcome material-limited constraints, yields prompt and efficient experimental assessment during the development stages of mining projects. However, it has barely benefited from geochemical modeling tools despite their ease of use. Accordingly, this paper aims to strengthen the upstream geochemical assessment via parametric analysis that simulates the effect of various mineral assemblages on leachate quality recovered from weathering cells. The main objective is to simulate the pH in presence of silicate neutralizing minerals and Mn release from carbonates based upon minimal characterization data. The public domain code PHREEQC was used for geochemical kinetic modeling of four weathering cells. The kinetic model utilized a water film concept to simulate diffusion of chemical elements from mineral surfaces to the pore water. The obtained results suggest that the presence of the silicate neutralizing minerals slightly affects the Mn rele...Download Free PDFView PDFMetalsAcid Mine Drainage Dynamics from a Paste Tailing Deposit: Effect of Sulfate Content on the Consistency and Chemical Stability after StorageChristian LedezmaSurface paste tailings’ disposal has emerged recently as an optimal and efficient method to favor tailings’ self-containment after being deposited into dams. This disposal method can improve the reuse of water and reduce the generation of acid mine drainage (AMD) and the release of leachates (e.g., acid and heavy metals). However, the implications of chemical factors or mixed-water chemistry in the stability of paste tailings over time are not clear. In this work, we evaluated the release of sulfate from tailing samples and the role of sulfate as a critical factor in the tailings’ strength, consistency, and stability. Our results showed that the release of acid runoff with high sulfate load from the tailings is negligible. Leaching tests were performed for 180 days and did not show a significant release of sulfate, heavy metals, or acid waters. However, the presence of sulfate salts derived from the binders used in the pretreatment of the paste tailings shows an impact on the tailin...Download Free PDFView PDFEnvironmental Characterization of the Abandoned Kettara Mine Wastes (Morocco)Rachid HakkouDownload Free PDFView PDFAcid Mine Drainage and Effects on Fish Health and Ecology: A Reviewrifin odeDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
