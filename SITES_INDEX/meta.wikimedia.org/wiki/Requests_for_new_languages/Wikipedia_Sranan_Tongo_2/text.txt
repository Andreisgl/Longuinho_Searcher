Please read the handbook for requesters for help using this template correctly.
Untill beginning: my English is not good i sorry you for these.
The first request is not good, so i start a new second request. Sranan Tongo is spoken with around the 120 000 people native and 300 000 people as second or third langauge. It has have had a valid ISO 639-code and i doing the testproject is good and many articles already. I think it is good when this wiki is have been going to be created.
Arguments in favour[edit]
Strong Support: A Native speaker is willing to contribute to this project in the long-term, hence this project has the potential to flourish like the other language Wikipedia editions such as Kreyòl ayisyen, Tok Pisin etc. Therefore the Sranan Tongo language ought to be given the opportunity and priviledge to have its own language edition of Wikipedia. --Jose77 21:32, 30 December 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Case comparable to Papiamento. This has been a long time wish of the Dutch Wikimedia Association. About half of the speaker population actually lives in the Netherlands, where virtually everyone has access to the internet and where it will be relatively easy to crimp potential contributors. Reaching a few in Suriname won't be too difficult, too. Steinbach (formerly Caesarion) 18:22, 14 January 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply]
One of the most active projects on the incubator. The localisation is poor however, but there has been worked on recently. --OosWesThoesBes 18:43, 14 January 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply]
500-mostused MediaWiki messages are translated. The test project is active and have 4 active users. Grutu, Jordi (mi taki) 14:17, 20 January 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Arguments against[edit]
The literary tradition is somewhat scanty. Most if not all speakers write and read more fluently in Dutch. Steinbach (formerly Caesarion) 18:22, 14 January 2008 (UTC) obviously acting as a devil's advocate hereReply[reply]
I think that should only be against a Wikisource not a Wikipedia. Of what I know it's write it down how you pronounce it (though my Sranan is less than srn-1, I can write it a little bit) --OosWesThoesBes 14:47, 19 January 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Literary may be scanty but is diveloping. In the future shall Sranantongo wan good literary and a Wikipedia is good allready i think. Adfokati 12:38, 27 January 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply]
General Discussion[edit]
Is it Sranantongo or Sranan Tongo? --OosWesThoesBes 18:44, 14 January 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Sranantongo. Grutu, Jordi (mi taki) 14:17, 20 January 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Okay, we have quite a number of articles, not all of which are stubs. We have at least three devoted users that are either native or fluent speakers. Much of the interface seems to have been translated. Let's do it (conditional approval at least)! Steinbach (formerly Caesarion) 14:11, 22 January 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply]
The term "conditional approval" is no longer used. This project has been "conditionally approved" for quite some time. Currently we are in the verification stage.. the language committee is of the opinion that when they looked last time the quality of the content was not rich enough. We want to see some decent articles. This is not a numbers game. GerardM 10:34, 23 January 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply]
I don't know when you last checked the test wiki, but the number of articles with actual content has increased over the last few days. Steinbach (formerly Caesarion) 11:31, 23 January 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply]
I totally agree with Steinbach. Looking to the Incubator's list of 1000 Shortest Pages, you'll only see one subpage, one community portal, one stub with unknown contents and one page about the people living in Suriname, which can easily be enlarged of the Sranan Wikipedia. Compared to one of the approved and created languages, Bicol wikipedia (wp/bcl), which has over 30 pages in the list. So ten conclusie van this list,w e can see Sranan Wikipedia is not a second Nepal Bhasa (wp/new) Wikipedia which has 35 000 pages with 26 bytes or so ([1] I can't read that script so I can't tell but over 1000 pages have less than a 100 bytes for sure) --OosWesThoesBes 16:15, 23 January 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply]
I've expanded Srananman a little bit and I've made it one of the biggest pages currently. I hope to this with more pages and with more users, but there is no one active today. --OosWesThoesBes 17:58, 23 January 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply]
The edits of many pages (not all, templates, talk pages, categories and uncategorisized pages are not shown) of the test could be seen as a sort of recent changes using RecentChangesLinked (my interface has been set to Lozi and Limburgish so I can't tell the English name): Recent Changes. This reveals this is one of the most active projects of the incubator and more active than many other Wikipedias with over 3500 pages (like Limburgish and Armenian) --OosWesThoesBes 18:55, 23 January 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply]
The language committee is not in a hurry .. we aim to look at projects once a month. One of the factors is the existence of a community.. the continued editing and maintenance of a project is what we look for. The assesment of the status is exclusively done by members of the language committee.  GerardM 23:49, 23 January 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Yes, I can understand it. The test just exists a month and it's logic it hasn't proved it will stay active and there are of course many more projects to watch. But I'm just putting a few things here to show to sceptical people that the Sranan Wikipedia can easily survive. --OosWesThoesBes 05:57, 24 January 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply]
So as we have promised, we will wait untill middle februari or end februari. In the meantime we can expand our stubs, created new pages (like this one) and maybe we can translate the interface more to. We are now one of the most activest wikipedia's in the incubator ([2]) Grutu, Jordi (mi taki) 11:20, 27 January 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply]
We are working very hard on the creation of new larger articles and expanding old articles. We have made a list of larger articles here. These are not the largest articles, but larger articles. And we are more active than before [3]. --OosWesThoesBes 18:09, 13 February 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply]
Nice, but I don't think you have to convince anyone of the feasability of the project. Be confident, it will be approved very soon anyway. Steinbach (formerly Caesarion) 18:39, 13 February 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply]
:) Not with one-sentence stubs. It's just to show we do what is expected from us :) (noe de wikinuujs nag) --OosWesThoesBes 18:42, 13 February 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply]
We start to become a real wikipedia. We are ready to leave incubator. We have even the first pages that are marked for deletion and are unsourced. With 6 active users we are an active community, I'm not planning to leave so a new wiki can be good. Grutu, Jordi (mi taki) 18:37, 19 February 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply]
