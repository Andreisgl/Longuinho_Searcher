Platonic Mimesis Revisited (Academia Verlag, 2021)Stephen  HalliwellThis paper argues that the semantics of mimesis and related terms in Plato’s dialogues are far less stable than orthodox accounts claim. After some preliminary remarks on the intricate implications of the Republic’s Cave allegory in this respect, I focus first on difficulties of interpretation raised by mimesis vocabulary in the Sophist, including the much-discussed dichotomy of eikastikê and phantastikê, whose complications make it a provisional and ultimately discarded attempt to distinguish between reliable and unreliable forms of representation. In the Republic, the semantics of mimesis expand and contract according to the needs of different stages of the argument, as well as shifting between negative and positive evaluations. Part of my analysis concerns the Republic’s series of comparisons between philosophers and painters, comparisons which are at odds with Socrates’ reductive treatment of painting in Book 10. The Sophist calls mimesis a ‘multifarious class’ of entities: no single argument in Plato supplies a definitive way of theorising its conceptual ramifications; we should abandon talk of ‘Plato’s doctrine’ of mimesis.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersEpoche: A Journal for the History of PhilosophyOn The Threefold Sense of Mimesis in Plato’s Republic2013 • James RisserThe traditional reading of Plato’s criticism of the poets and painters in Book 10 of the Republic is that they merely imitate. In light of Plato’s own image-making, the critique of imitation requires a more careful examination, especially in regards to painting. This paper argues that it is insufficient to view Plato’s critique of image-making by the painter solely in terms of the image replication that does not consider the eidos. In view of the context of Plato’s argument within Book 10 and elsewhere, other considerations, such as the ideas of measure and proportion, which pertain to the notion of the beautiful, are required for a complete understanding of the argument against the painter. In light of these further considerations I argue for a threefold distinction between mimesis as replication, mimesis as false resemblance, and mimesis as true resemblance. With respect to the third kind of mimesis, which directly pertains to Plato’s own image-making, one can see in Plato a different configuration of the relation between image and original portrayed in the image.Download Free PDFView PDFReview of Julia Pfefferkorn, Antonino Spinelli (eds.)

Mimesis plays a crucial and highly contested role in the dialogue as a whole, figuring centrally in Books II, III, and X. Socrates picks up his earlier discussion of it in the tenth and final book in the light the intervening discussion in books IV through IX of the role of justice in an ideal city and in the well-balanced individual psyche. I will discuss some of the complexities attendant upon the role of mimesis in the Republic; this will be followed by a treatment of the responses of René Girard and Eric Gans, both of whom, because of the central role played by mimesis in their work, of necessity comment on Plato’s founding role in relation to the...Download Free PDFView PDFRevisiting Mimesis in Plato: An Introduction.

The scene that the readers observe presents the speakers but, much more significantly, it presents the actual subject matter. This ability to use words to make something visible was an art that was studied intensively by theoreticians of language during antiquity.Download Free PDFView PDFAisthesis 1(1): 75-86Seeing through Plato's Looking Glass. Mythos and Mimesis from Republic to Poetics2017 • Andrea CapraThis paper revisits Plato's and Aristotle's views on mimesis with a special emphasis on mythos as an integral part of it. I argue that the Republic's notorious " mirror argument " is in fact ad hominem: first, Plato likely has in mind Agathon's mirror in Aristophanes' Thesmoforiazusae, where tragedy is construed as mimesis; second, the tongue-in-cheek claim that mirrors can reproduce invisible Hades, when read in combination with the following eschatological myth, suggests that Plato was not committed to a mirror-like view of art; third, the very omission of mythos shows that the argument is a self-consciously one-sided one, designed to caricature the artists' own pretensions of mirror-like realism. These points reinforce Stephen Halliwell's claim that Western aesthetics has been haunted by a «ghostly misapprehension» of Plato's mirror. Further evidence comes from Aristotle's " literary " (as opposed to Plato's " sociological ") discussion: rather than to the " mirror argument " , the beginning of the Poetics points to the Phaedo as the best source of information about Plato's views on poetry.Download Free PDFView PDFFrom the cave to the screen: Plato and the problem of mimesis [Keynote lecture, conference on 'Mimesis Now', University of Rochester, April 2012]2012 • Stephen  HalliwellDownload Free PDFView PDFPlatonic Mimesis RevisitedRevisiting Mimesis in Plato: An Introduction2021 • Antonino  SpinelliDownload Free PDFView PDFAnthology of Philosophical Studies, Athens Institute for Education and ResearchWhy has Plato written about Mimesis?2015 • María J. Ortega MáñezMimesis is one of the “most baffling words in the philosophical vocabulary”. Its importance in the history of Western Philosophy, especially in regards to its aesthetic declination, is never sufficiently highlighted. The word appears in the ancient Greek language as linked to certain theatrical performances from Sicily, but it is Plato who first gave it an enormous philosophical scope. The concept is present all along the Dialogues, with an evolving – or even changing – meaning and function which constitutes a fluctuant reflection. Among these different uses, we will first distinguish between two semantic poles. On the one hand, mimesis allows Plato to understand and to judge phenomena as sophistic discourses as well as poetry and arts. On the other hand, although linked to this aspect, he will make it the bridge point between the two worlds of his ontology. In this way mimesis becomes the main justification for excluding the imitative poet (i.e. the theater’s performer) from the Republic’s just city: imitation is untruthful (book III), and furthermore, it hides the reality (book X). It is nevertheless surprising that Plato builds his criticism around this concept when considering its semantic origin. Why would Plato use a theater-related word as such in order to develop a devastating criticism of theater? This paper tackles this variation of a classic philosophical paradox (why Plato employs the dialogic form of writing, which is theatrical itself, whereas he condemns theatre?) according to a new approach: the conceptual procedure applied by Plato to mimesis is at the very end his answer to a challenge proposed by theater. In order to demonstrate this, it will be necessary to analyze this conceptual procedure on its own, as well as to specify which kind of theater this challenge could possibly come from. This study thus aims to clarify the relationship between philosophy and theater which the concept of mimesis seems to bring to the front.
