From mediawiki.org
MediaWiki developers and users[1] rely on several upstream and/or 3rd party projects for their architecture or processes. At the same time, they develop software projects used by others, which are downstream to them. These links define our location in the free software map, our neighbor communities, and the flows of feedback, patches, and contributors.
Let's identify our upstream projects, our neighbor communities, and the contributors that connect us with them.
Motivation[edit]
This is a first step to improve our relations with other communities, to increase the contributions received, and our influence in the projects that matter to us.
Our mid-term goals include:
identify the projects where we want to see significant development, to the point of sending patches as well
identify the communities where Wikimedia should be regularly active and heard
identify the people in the Wikimedia and upstream communities that know each other and act as bridge
identify organizations and events we should get in touch and be part of
get involved in bigger development efforts regularly, become a regular FOSS player
Invented here[edit]
See Maintainers for all components, libraries, and extensions that we maintain and deploy with or around MediaWiki.
For a larger list of software projects that we publish see Wikimedia Open Source.
