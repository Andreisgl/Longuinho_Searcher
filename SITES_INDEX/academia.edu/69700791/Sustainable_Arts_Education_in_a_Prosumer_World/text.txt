Despite the prominent and indispensable role the Arts could play in the process of nation building in the 21st Century, it is quite unfortunate that it seems governments all over the world, curriculum planners, and other stake holders in the education sector do not consider the prominent role that the Arts could play in raising awareness of the fundamental problems that militates against the development of a nation, the solution to these problems and preparing them on how to tackle future challenges that concerns their immediate community at large.

Value, Challenge and PotentialCultural Sustainability and (Post-)digital Transformation(s) in the Context of Aesthetic, Arts, and Cultural Education2022 • Elke MöllerThis chapter discusses questions of digitalization in the context of aesthetics, arts, and cultural education, and cultural sustainability. We first outline in what respect (post-)digitalization becomes relevant with regards to the UNESCO Sustainable Development Goals. (Post-) digitalization, we argue, must be understood as an integral part of aesthetics, arts, and cultural education, because it has already brought forth (new) cultural techniques relevant in the understanding of and thus the participation in one’s own culture and on a global scale. After introducing the concept of post-digitalization, we present two case studies from research projects within this research area Digitalization & Arts and Cultural Education, analyzing creative coding in online “learning ecologies” (Post-Digital Art Practices in Cultural Education) and the virtual character Hatsune Miku (Post-Internet Art(s) Education Research) respectively. Following their preliminary findings, we focus on collective creative practices as (new) post-digital cultural techniques and on distributed production effects that arise in post-digital settings. Questions of structure, of implicit power relations and hierarchy, and of new processes of subjectivation are addressed in particular. We argue that it is precisely aesthetics, arts, and cultural education that have the potential to contribute to how we not only understand (post-)digitality but also shape it towards cultural sustainability.Download Free PDFView PDFThe Canadian Review of Art EducationEducation, Arts and Sustainability: Emerging Practice for a Changing World, by Mary Ann Hunter, Arnold Aprill, Allen Hill Sherridan EmeryKudrat-E-Khuda BabuBook Response: Education, Arts and Sustainability: Emerging Practice for a Changing World, by Mary Ann Hunter, Arnold Aprill, Allen Hill & Sherridan Emery.
