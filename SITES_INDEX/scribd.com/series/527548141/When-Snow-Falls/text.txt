There's no room in a schedule crammed with university, a full-time job, music, and his very committed relationship with overthinking. Hence the dating ban. Which is exactly when Ben Campbell shows up with his piercings, quirky knits, and indie rock fame. But maybe it's time for Charlie to trade caffeine for something hotter, blonder, and completely out of his comfort zone.Gorgeous, funny men don't happen to Charlie. Not like this. Even if it's ill-timed and too bloody complicated. But maybe a quick shag won't hurt . . .Sex might be easy, but being vulnerable isn't. Not for Charlie, his anxiety, or his precarious stack of responsibilities. It would be so easy to fall into Ben's world of cozy, snowy London where there's love and sex and possibilities. But Charlie already knows what happens when he goes off course. Not to mention the consequences. And when the snow melts, he'll have to put his heart back into a deep freeze . . .Contains mature themes.Read moreLanguageEnglishPublisherTantor AudioRelease dateApr 19, 2022View titles in seriesSave for laterDownload to appShareShare titleTitles in the series (2)An Unexpected Kind of LoveSave An Unexpected Kind of Love for laterAudiobook #1An Unexpected Kind of LoveHayden StoneRating: 4 out of 5 stars4/5 - 60 ratingsRating: 4 out of 5 stars4/5 - 60 ratingsBookstore owner Aubrey Barnes likes his quiet, orderly London life, thank you very much. His shop may be struggling, his only employee is a menace, and his plumbing is one creaky pipe away from disaster, but he can handle it. Maybe. He cannot, however, handle the film company that's thrown his Soho street into chaos.
And he definitely can't handle the charismatic American actor Blake Sinclair.
Which is why he's extremely reluctant to lease out his shop as a set for Blake's film, but it's his one opportunity to save his business. Now he can't get away from the distractingly hot actor.
Then Aubrey finds himself alone with Blake in a trailer, and what happens next turns London's heat wave into an inferno that leaves him breathless.
Aubrey is not cut out for the high-profile life of dating a celebrity, especially an American actor who's not even out yet. Good thing their tryst is absolutely not going anywhere.
Of course, when you expect nothing, that's exactly when it starts to mean everything.
