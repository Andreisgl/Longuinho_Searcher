Polish Archaeology in the Mediterranean PCMAUniversity of Warsaw,  Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology,  JournalArchaeology+114See the journal website: https://pcma.uw.edu.pl/en/pam-journal-2/     The open-access, peer-reviewed journal "Polish Archaeology in the Mediterranean" appears annually, in English,  presenting archaeological, geophysical, conservation & restoration fieldwork, as well as academic research, from a broadly considered Near East, including the Arabian Peninsula and the Caucasus, as well as northeastern and northern Africa.     The chronological scope is very broad, from prehistory and protohistory through all the historic periods in the Near East and Northeastern Africa, broadly understood Greco-Roman civilizations in the southern and eastern parts of the Mediterranean, as well as early Christianity, including the medieval Nubian kingdoms in Africa, and the Islamic Age in all of the regions in question.     The scope of the Journal, both territorial and chronological, is a derivative of the original founding editorial policy, which was the presentation of the full extent of work done by researchers and specialists under the aegis of the Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology (PCMA), a research unit of the University of Warsaw established in 1959.     The journal continues to host publications of current research with an emphasis on new excavations, conducted by teams either from or associated with the PCMA, but since 2008 it has become more study-oriented in an effort to provide a platform for presenting original research deriving from the reported discoveries.Supervisors: Chief Editor: Iwona ZychAddress: 00-497 Warsaw, ul.

The adjacent section of the outer wall, which also sustained heavy damage during modern construction works in 1964 before the theater was discovered, also called for immediate consolidation (Fig. 1). An inventory was made of the wall facing before the entire section was dismantled; the wall was then reassembled preserving as much of the ancient substance as could be retrieved; in many cases the original mortar in the joints was preserved, although several seriously damaged or crushed blocks had to be replaced with new ones (Fig. 2). The newly applied mortar was similar to the ancient one and composed of sand, lime, and powdered bricks with a 5% addition of white Portland cement.

This was coupled with a study of last year's assemblage. The excavations proper were a continuation of the 2002 effort in three sectors: Temenos A (court fronting the Roman temple), village E in the northern part north of thistemple, and streets E.XXV and room E.XXVI situated in the immediate vicinity of oil press E.II, on terraces above the church. Emphasis was placed on clarifying the chronology of particular buildings and on understanding the layout of the village through the discovery of further sections of the plan. Some limited testing was also undertaken.

Archaeological monitoring of the removal of dumps and the subsequent survey and documentation work were envisaged as the first and prerequisite stage of a site presentation project. The actual arranging of the prospected archaeological park was to proceed over the next couple of years with the ultimate objective of opening the site to the tourist industry as an important stop on the Mediterranean coastal itinerary – a veritable Egyptian “Pompeii” to be visited.The ARCE/EAP MASP project was carried out independently, taking advantage of a close association with the Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology, which holds the license for archaeological exploration and conservation of the site.The archaeological stage of the project took place over a period of eight weeks between January 25 and March 15, 2006, with an additional two weeks at the Polish Centre in Cairo for completing the documentation.1 Altogether an area of some 8850 m2 was surveyed archaeologically and recorded, and the offensive dumps were removed and landscaped in preparation for the next stages of the project.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

An analysis of this set of burials indicated that a new burial rite, characterized by strong family and clan ties, had been introduced about the beginning of the second millennium BC. Parallels for MBA burial practices have been recorded on neighboring sites in the Upper Khabur area and in southern Mesopotamia. Equid burial s accompanied some of the human graves and it seems that the custom saw a revival in this period once again after the EBA. Close parallels for this custom as well as other elements of the burial practices at sites in the eastern  Nile Delta and in the southern Levant are interesting to note. The spread of similar practices can be linked with high probability to the presence and growing political dominance of West Semites.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Huge foundations from the Akkadian period were discovered in its vicinity, confirming the prominence of the Tell Arbid citadel in the second half of the 3rd millennium BC. In Sector W-East explorations covered the surroundings of the Southern Temple of Ninevite 5 period date. The temple proved to be standing on a stepped terrace(?), of which two steps were discovered, confirming the idea that some sort of open space in front of the temple entrance stretched to the south. A large L-shaped courtyard was excavated to the northwest of the temple and more Ninevite 5 period architecture was investigated to the northeast of the building. A so-called Great Wall (14 m long and up to 4 m wide), found southeast of the temple, is believed to date to the ED II period; whatever its function, the wall ceased to be used by the Akkadian period, as it was covered by architectural remains of this date.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Moreover, SMQ 49 was one of just a few stone mounds from the As-Sabbiya area which could be dated, thus contributing data for a chronology of tumuli that are widespread in this part of Kuwait.

Further vestiges of this period in the form of architecture and an infant grave were found north and northeast of the temple. Investigations of a massive wall from the ED III period, pursued from the previous seasons, still failed to identify its function. In the course of work on this structure, an Akkadian house and street were excavated, and a Khabur Ware period chamber tomb was discovered. Keywords: temple, terrace, ramp, burial, Ninevite 5 period, ED III period, Khabur Ware period, Akkadian periodSave to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Animal husbandry proved to have been at the core of the animal economy at the site from the beginning of the 3rd millennium BC through modern times. The chief species at the start were small ruminants (50–80% of bones in the assemblage), supplemented later with pig (10–35%) and cattle (5–20%). Hunting and gathering mollusks were of minor importance. Equids were represented among bone remains from all periods. In the Khabur Ware period there was a shift in the animal economy from a stationary one based mainly on breeding pigs to pastoralism characterized by a growing share of small ruminants.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The results contributed to a better understanding of the street network in the quarter and the nature of the architecture. The quarter comprising the 21 newly uncovered rooms taken together with 80 from earlier fieldwork in 2008 and 2009 formed an extensive residential complex, approximately 40 m by 35 m. It is a unique example of private domestic architecture illustrating everyday life in Roman and Byzantine Phoenicia.

An assessment of the morphology and production technology of Ninevite 5 kitchen ware is undertaken in this article, based primarily on a collection of kitchen ware (some 80 diagnostic pieces) from Ninevite 5 levels excavated by a PCMA UW team on Tell Arbid. This collection was supplemented with material from a number of other sites in northeastern Syria. The discussion highlights the morphological variation of vessels (pots, jars, bowls and lids), considered in the light of their size, proportions and wall orientation. It also looks into technological pottery properties, such as raw material, temper, surface treatment and firing temperature. Intended use is discussed at length, special attention being given to functional requirements, such as thermal shock resistance and heating efficiency, and the morphological and technological factors that influenced them.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The report is a preliminary assessment  of the results of excavations carried out in 2010 and 2011, which uncovered the inside of the  structure as well as a continuous surface of melted gypsum anhydrite around it that was  proved to be at least in part a tumble of large wall ashlars. A provisional dating of the  remains suggests an early Roman origin for the structure, which may have been a sanctuary.  The findings indicate that it was already abandoned in the 4th–5th centuries when the  neighboring “Lotus Temple”, uncovered concurrently by the Polish–American team, was at  its peak. Finds included an inscribed altar dedicated to Domitian(?), discovered among the  tumble of a stone basin and unidentified installation, and some remains of bronze statuary,  oil lamps, glass beads and other finds.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

an... more Abstract: Berenike was a gateway to the distant lands of Africa and the Indian Ocean littoraland the archaeological record from the site testifies to the scope and rich array of goodspassing through this Red Sea port. However, investigation of the Hellenistic origins of thetown began in earnest only after a full magnetic survey was completed of the western fringesof the site where the Ptolemaic foundation was believed to have been established. Recentexcavations in 2010 and 2012 have contributed important new data about the architecture ofthis part of the town. Of particular interest were the remains of a presumed tetrapyrgionassociated with a huge defensive complex, roughly 150 m by 80 m in size, which may havebeen used, among other things, for bringing through wild elephants from Africa importedfor use by the Ptolemaic army. This contribution initiates a series of articles by the author onthe Hellenistic defenses now under excavation at Berenike, presenting an overview of thelocation and structure of the great fort/base of Berenike Trogodytika and its role in thenetwork of military harbors on the Red Sea coast, and the posts on the routes and fortifiedoutposts of the Eastern Desert.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

An examination of parallels from other sites in the Eastern Mediterranean wasneeded in order to determine the chronology and uses of these objects. Virtually all of theJiyeh vessels were thus dated to the early Byzantine period. Forms included utilitarianmortars and plates, as well as tentative liturgical tabletops. The repertoire represents standard exports of vessels of these shapes to Syro-Palestine from Greece and Asia Minor. Their distribution in Syro-Palestine was conditioned by geographical factors, as well as the affluence of settlements that imported such objects.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Our research encompasses all of the more than two 2000 personal ornaments retrieved from Hasanlu, from the Middle Bronze through the Iron Age, and from a wide range of contexts, including the cemetery on the Low Mound, and the bodies of victims of the destruction of the elite buildings on the citadel, and in storerooms in these buildings. These unusual contexts provide a unique opportunity to compare ornaments found in burials with those worn in daily life, and to assess the extent to which they were deemed valuable within this society. Michelle Marcus’s published work on issues of adornment and dress at Hasanlu has been criticized and indeed was limited by a site-wide publication approach that focused on specific materials and artifact classes in advance of a clear understanding of the complex archaeological contexts. Now that the final excavation reports are in preparation, the authors were able to integrate newer scientific research and ground their analysis of personal ornaments in a broader understanding of the site. Some conclusions reached in earlier scholarship have now been revised, but in other cases, the conclusions drawn by Marcus in her work on the women’s burial assemblages in particular have been corroborated, namely that at Hasanlu personal adornment played a role in the construction and communication of a gendered, militarized identity that emerged in Period IVb, and indeed have been extended to include adornment in men’s graves as well.Keywords: Hasanlu, ancient jewelry, gendered burials, lion pins, elite jewelry, militarizationSave to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The argument is put forward that this pendant forms a miniature replication of a vessel that was used in the production, storage, and supply of malachite body paint. Due to its correspondence in colour with vegetation, malachite may have been believed to have endowed its wearer with the positive qualities of life, growth, fertility, and healing. On this basis, it is contended that the pendant functioned as an amulet by providing its wearer with magical access to malachite paint and its associated properties. Since a palette pendant from the Naqada IID-IIIB period is argued to have functioned in a similar way as the Badarian pendant, this is taken to suggest that the people who lived during the Badarian and Naqadian periods ...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Traces of ancient repairs may be discerned in the distorted layers of limestone blocks and deformed relief. The nature of this restoration indicates that it took place once the sculpting of the reliefs had been completed but before the painting. The reasons for this can be related to the short building time of the temple.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Poor preservation resulted in some 10% of the bones not being identified to species. Bone remains were located likewise in chambers, shafts, tunnels and looters' trenches. They represented the following species: cattle, ovicaprines and dog. Marks recorded on the bones confirmed that the cuts of meat from cattle and ovicaprines were served as food offerings for the dead. The dog bones were probably connected to some form of ritual performed during the funeral.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The conservation and restoration program put finishing touches on the Raphaelion church in Banganarti and did substantial work o the remains of the earlier churches. The oldest church from Selib 1 was investigated and dated to the 6th– 7th century based on a study of a well stratified ceramic assemblage. Pottery from the northern and southern refuse dumps ranged in date from the 9th to the 12th/13th century. A group of liturgical vessels, containing mostly small juglets and chalices, was distinguished in this assemblage. Exploration of the earlier Northern Building revealed pottery contemporaneous with the earliest phase of the church on site.

Exploration started with the fill of the room, followed by the fill of structures belonging to an earlier building below it. A well dated sequence of layers from the 6th through 7th centuries was identified. The pottery assemblage proved to be very abundant, composed of table vessels, cooking pots, storage and transport containers; the lattermost group included imported examples, mainly from Egypt. Most of the finds represented Dongolan ceramic production from the period in question.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Nevertheless, the naive appearance of the sketch and an almost complete lack of sufficient parallels from either Nubia or the Eastern Mediterranean make a proper examination of this assumption unfeasible. A reassessment of the architectural drawing from the cathedral, however, draws a wider perspective for a discussion of originality in Nubian architecture. The following paper presents the rather modest evidence available for a study of the nature of Nubian architecture from the point of view of its builders.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Their main characteristics and cultural context are discussed, as well as the cross-pottery connections. The significance of these ceramic vessels for the Gulf population and their socioeconomic context are also considered in this paper, given the new evidence from Bahra 1.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

From Sacred to Everyday Common Wares and Amphorae from Chhim in the Sidon Hinterlandby Urszula Wicenciak, The Joint Expedition to Chhim and Jiyeh, Lebanon.

The two sites are only 10 km apart and are located in the territory of the town of Sidon. Porphyreon supplied Chhim with ceramic vessels during the Early Roman and Early Byzantine periods, both cooking utensils and wine amphorae, which may have been used for the locally produced olive oil at Chhim.  Translated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)This book is published open access. It can be downloaded:https://www.peeters-leuven.be/pdf/9789042945456.pdf  https://www.peeters-leuven.be/detail.php?search_key=9789042945449&series_number_str=4&lang=en   The volume is the outcome of intermittent studies on the archaeological pottery assemblage excavated from Chhim, an ancient village site in the mountains of central Lebanon. It is the first such comprehensive presentation of common wares and amphorae from the rural hinterland of Phoenicia in classical Antiquity and the Late Antique period.Unbecoming at first glance, these ceramics, which are the fabric of everyday life, as well as Hellenistic Phoenician tableware, have told their own story. Presented in the cultural and economic context of central Phoenicia, taking into consideration local and regional histories, as well as evolving pottery-making traditions over time, these relatively modest vessels have mirrored a dynamic transition of Chhim from an isolated, if hallowed, hilltop sanctuary to a pulsing production site, one of the biggest producers of olive oil in the Sidon hinterland, and subsequently to a deserted village sinking into oblivion.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
