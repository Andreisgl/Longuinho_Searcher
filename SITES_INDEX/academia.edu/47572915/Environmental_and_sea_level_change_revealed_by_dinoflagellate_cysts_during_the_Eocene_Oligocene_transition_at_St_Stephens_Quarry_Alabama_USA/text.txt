The EOT is recorded in deepsea benthic foraminiferal oxygen isotope (δ 18 O) records as two increasing steps, ∼200 kyr apart. However, the relative contribution of cooling and increasing ice-volume cannot be separated from such δ 18 O records. Independent temperature-and sea-level reconstructions are crucial for understanding the order of events enveloping the onset of Antarctic glaciation.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersGeologyMultiproxy record of abrupt sea-surface cooling across the Eocene-Oligocene transition in the Gulf of Mexico2012 • Henk BrinkhuisDownload Free PDFView PDFReview of Palaeobotany and PalynologyPentadinium alabamensis: A new, unusual dinoflagellate from the early Oligocene of the Gulf Coast, Alabama, USA2012 • Henk BrinkhuisDownload Free PDFView PDFPalaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, PalaeoecologyThe Eocene-Oligocene transition: Changes in sea level, temperature or both?2012 • Henk BrinkhuisDownload Free PDFView PDFGlobal and Planetary ChangeEocene to Oligocene high paleolatitude neritic record of Oi-1 glaciation in the Otway Basin southeast Australia2020 • Stephen GallagherMultiple stable isotope investigations from upper Eocene to lower Oligocene deep-water marine sequences record the transition from global greenhouse to the icehouse conditions (Oi-1 glacial). While Southern Ocean high latitude deep sea records of this transition are well known, their shallow marine equivalents are rare and have the potential to record the eustatic and oceanic consequences of Paleogene glacial variability. The well-known high paleolatitude (~55°S) neritic carbonate sequence at Browns Creek and Castle Cove in the Otway Basin in southeast Australia spans the Eocene-Oligocene boundary. During this time the area lay on the northeastern margin of the Australo-Antarctic Gulf facing the evolving Southern Ocean. The importance of this record has been hampered by a lack of a consistent stratigraphy and contradictory microfossil interpretations. To reconcile these issues we combine new bio-, chemo-and lithostratigraphic analyses of the outcrops and a new core (Colac-2) with pre-existing data to revise the stratigraphy. This confirms the middle/upper Eocene boundary is near the base of the section. The overlying upper Eocene siliciclastic strata are truncated by an unconformity (of~0.8 Ma in duration) and overlain by glauconitic sand (the Notrostrea greensand) deposited after~35.9 Ma. Subsequently deepening to middle to outer neritic depths deposited cyclic carbonates. Shallowing after~35 Ma deposited laterally variable calcareous siliciclastic facies. These strata were tilted and eroded prior to 34 Ma leading to shallow water facies that may have been subaerially exposed during uplift. Brachiopod strontium isotope dates and an 0.5‰ carbon isotope excursion above this unconformity suggests the top of the Browns Creek and the base of the Castle Cove section correlate to Eocene-Oligocene transition (EOT-1) at~34 Ma. The subsequent persistence of positive C/O isotope values above this level records the transition to the Oi-1 glaciation at 33.7 Ma. Strong cyclicity in the inner shelf Castle Cove limestone is interpreted to record the commencement of obliquity dominated glacio-eustacy during the Oi-1 glacial phase. The shallowing from outer to inner shelf palaeodepths from the late Eocene to the early Oligocene is likely related to the onset of cryosphere expansion, however, palaeodepth estimates are complicated by the onset of regional compressional tectonism at the Eocene/Oligocene boundary that caused localized tilting and an unconformity with possible antisiphoning effects in this near-field site.Download Free PDFView PDFScientific ReportsClimate- and gateway-driven cooling of Late Eocene to earliest Oligocene sea surface temperatures in the North Sea BasinPetra SchoonDownload Free PDFView PDFShallow-marine ostracode turnover during the Eocene-Oligocene transition in Mississippi, the Gulf Coast Plain, USA2014 • Tatsuhiko YamaguchiThe Eocene-Oligocene transition (EOT) is associated with a major eustatic sea-level fall, sea surface cooling, change in ocean stratification, and enhanced seasonality. While these changes are well known to have significantly restructured open ocean ecosystems, comparatively little is known about how these multiple environmental changes affected coastal biotas. Here we describe ostracode faunas in shelf deposits in the Gulf Coast of Mexico through the Late Eocene to Early Oligocene, analyzing the biostratigraphy and paleoecology of ostracodes from the Mossy Grove Core, Mississippi. Mossy Grove ostracode faunas suffered gradual extinction and diversity loss in the 150 kyr between 33.96 to 33.81 Ma. During the turnover, 10 of 21 species disappeared. Seven of the 12 disappearing species became extinct, while others are Lazarus taxa that later re-appear in the Vicksburgian (~33.7 Ma). During the sea-level fall associated with the Eocene/Oligocene (E/O) boundary (33.90 Ma), six of seven outer-shelf taxa disappeared, while three of four inner-shelf taxa increased in abundance. The major changes in ostracode assemblages occur during the EOT-1 and EOT-2 events prior to the Oi1 isotope excursion and appear to reflect a combination of impacts from eustatic sea-level fall and local enhanced surface ocean seasonality shown in stable isotope records from the St Stephen’s Quarry core, Alabama.Download Free PDFView PDFGeological Society of America BulletinEocene-Oligocene global climate and sea-level changes: St. Stephens Quarry, Alabama2008 • James WrightDownload Free PDFView PDFDeep water temperature, carbonate ion, and ice volume changes across the Eocene‐Oligocene climate transitionRobert ThunellDownload Free PDFView PDFGeological Society of America Special PapersIntegrated stratigraphic and astrochronologic calibration of the Eocene-Oligocene transition in the Monte Cagnero section (northeastern Apennines, Italy): A potential parastratotype for the Massignano global stratotype section and point (GSSP)2009 • Henk BrinkhuisDownload Free PDFView PDFThe late Eocene  …Integrated stratigraphic and astrochronologic calibration of the Eocene-Oligocene transition in the Monte Cagnero section (northeastern Apennines, Italy): A potential  …2009 • Brandon MurphyDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
