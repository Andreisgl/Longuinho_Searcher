Tradurre il Discours sur la poésie dramatique.Request PDFTradurre il Discours sur la poésie dramatique.in Historia Philosophica, vol. 12, 2014 M. GranatellaAbstractThis paper deals with a new italian translation of Diderot’s Discours sur la poésie dramatique. The importance of this Diderot’s work in the context of his thought, has constituted the starting point of this study. The aim of my argument is to demonstrate that a materialistic perspective lies at the core of theory and practice in Diderot's theater. This point of view will be explain using an analysis of identifying mechanisms as a philosophically relevant knowledge.
