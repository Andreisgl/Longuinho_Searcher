The first chapter contains a description of the pilot projects, which brought together care workers from the Blankenberg Foundation and Dynamo for early intervention aimed at preventing threatened evictions. In these interventions, they tried to stay a step ahead of a crisis by getting involved early on the basis of information housing corporations had about their residents’ payment problems. Chapter 2 is a report of a later investigation of the long-term effects of these interventions. The third chapter describes the pilot projects developed by Dynamo and PuurZuid, which made use of the expertise available in the general public, specifically the network of family, friends and neighbours surrounding people with rent payment debts. The expectation was that care workers would be able to provide more effective help using the decisionmaking mode...Save to Libraryby Paulina Sedney•Werken met ervaringsdeskundigen vereist cultuuromslagZorg- en hulpverleningsorganisaties moeten een cultuuromslag maken om ervaringsdeskundigheid en herstelondersteuning met succes te kunnen inzetten.

Dat kost tijd, vergt inspanning en vereist helderheid over rollen, taken en verantwoordelijkheden, zonder daarbij de eigenheid van ervaringsdeskundigen uit het oog te verliezen.Save to Libraryby Paulina Sedney•Zelfregie van mensen in kwetsbare positiesZelfregie, zelfredzaam zijn en eigen kracht; mensen worden steeds vaker geacht zelf het heft in handen te nemen en zich minder afhankelijk op te stellen, zowel richting overheid als richting professionele hulp- en dienstverlening.Save to Libraryby Paulina Sedney•Begrippenkader : ervaringsdeskundigheid en aanverwante begrippenDeze publicatie maakt deel uit van het RAAK project Who Knows?!

Under the name &quot;Krachtwerk on tour&quot; they traveled three weeks through the USA, covering about 7000 km from Boston to San Francisco and Berkeley, through New york, Chicago, Kansas and Los. They visited 25 projects, organizations and research groups and spoke with over 115 professionals. The study trip was inspired by reorganizations in the welfare state of the Netherlands. The Dutch model was moving towards a more American model of individual responsibility. By meeting the frontrunners in the field, the authors gathered experiences and ideas they could can use in their research, education, and practice. In their concluding chapter, they describe their general and personal impressions. Because peer run organizations have been applied in The States for many years, visiting these organizations was a source of inspiration for simi...Save to LibraryDownloadby Paulina Sedney•EngineeringEindrapportage 'Meer herstel in ZuidSave to Libraryby Paulina Sedney•Tandems van ervaringsdeskundigen en docenten zoeken, herkennen en overbruggen kloven tijdens het TandemontwikkeltrajectSave to LibraryDownloadby Paulina Sedney•Institutionele reproductie van salafistische jongeren in NederlandSave to Libraryby Mohammad Nazar Soroush•Social SciencesInjuries associated with landmines and unexploded ordnance in IranSave to LibraryDownloadby Mohammad Nazar Soroush•  4  Medicine, Clinical Sciences, Unexploded Ordnance, Medical and Health SciencesDoes team building lead to better performing teams?

These steps are applied to the experiment conducted in this paper. In this experiment the impact of giving a newly formed team a ‘LSD mini lecture’ on ‘return of investment’ is investigated. The experiment has an experimental condition in which participants do get the ‘LSD mini lecture’ manipulation and a control condition in which they do not get this manipulation. In both conditions the independent variables ‘communication’ and ‘cohesion’ are respectively measured by adapted versions of the ACP-360 and GCQ-23 questionnaire. The dependent variable ‘return of investment’ is measured as the costs per centimeter of height of a tower that the teams are asked to build. The final sample consisted of 49 teams (23 control condition, 26 experimental condition) with 3 participants per team. Results showed no difference in communication and cohesion per condition and no relation between communication, cohesion and return of investment. In conclusion we can say that our specific team building activity did not influence team communication, cohesion and task performance.Save to LibraryDownloadby Maarten Heidenrath•TeambuildingExternal designers in product design processes of small manufacturing firmsSave to LibraryDownloadby Murk Peutz•  7  Information Systems, Product Design, Case Studies, Collaborative DesignLarge-scale involvement of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises not participating in Innovation NetworksCurrent public innovation stimulating activities often fail to activate a significant group of SMEs.

They often lack skills, resources or networks to reach their full innovative potential. They therefore catch the eye of public policy makers. However, SMEs form a heterogeneous and opaque group, and are hard to address by current public innovation stimulating activities. Not-for-profit intermediary Syntens implemented " FuturizedBusinesses " in cooperation with Regional partners to improve participation of a 'middle group' of SMEs. Since 2008 the campaign committed nearly 2000 non-participating SMEs in innovation networks. The data indicate that they, notwithstanding their many weaknesses, show a considerable ambition to innovate in new markets, products, processes and organization. Data are presented in a cluster analysis indicating three emerging profiles of SMEs, with different ambition levels and capabilities to innovate.

Labour shortages and longevity stress the need for motivated and healthy workers. Workplace innovation can provide the tools for a needed overhaul in existing systems and processes. Small and Medium sized Enterprises (SMEs) are only slowly committing to workplace innovation, although the link between productivity and sustainable employability is well established. To enhance their efforts, SMEs have increasingly been targeted by intermediaries and policy makers. This paper presents the results of a specific project in this field. Over 300 SMEs have been consulted, and their progress with the topic is reported. Holistic tools like a growth scan have been combined with case-by-case consulting. An evaluation was conducted by means of analysis of web survey data. SMEs main incentive to join is improving employee satisfaction, i.e. the 'happy worker'. Innovations are sparked in organization, empowerment, development and appraisal systems, but less so in employee health related areas. The combination of scanning and consulting drives changes in attitudes and behaviour, as well as interventions and results. Professionals and policymakers can use these insights to help enhance sustainable employability in SMEs. .Save to LibraryDownloadby Murk Peutz and +1Willo Eurlings•  5  Employability, SME, Sustainable Development, Social InnovationEnhancing innovation in Small and Medium-sized Enterprises through short-term placement of Innovation OfficersSmall and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are an important source of innovation.

To enhance their innovation efforts, SMEs have increasingly been targeted by innovation intermediaries and policy makers. This paper presents one such intervention, called " Innovation Officer " , implemented by Syntens, a not-for-profit Dutch innovation intermediary. This intervention aims at stimulating innovation in SMEs by overcoming their lack of time and qualified personnel. An evaluation was conducted by means of an internet questionnaire and in-depth interviews of three cases. Results show that innovation officers influence a large number of topics, enhance actual innovation outcomes, and assist in overcoming the time bottleneck of SMEs. Their roles are highly diverse, but often emphasize the importance of external contacts for innovation.Save to LibraryDownloadby Murk Peutz•Stimulating Sustainability in SMEsSmall and Medium sized Enterprises (SMEs) are only slowly committing to sustainability in their products, processes and organisations.

To enhance their efforts, SMEs have increasingly been targeted by intermediaries and policy makers. This paper presents one such intervention, called " the Sustainability Quick Scan " , implemented by Syntens, a not-for-profit Dutch innovation intermediary. This intervention aims at stimulating awareness and uptake of sustainability in SMEs. Over 1000 SMEs carried out the quick scan. An evaluation was conducted by means of analysis of the quick scan data. Results show drivers for sustainability in SMEs. It is shown that SMEs are more sustainable once they have started addressing these drivers. A framework is established with a SME typology on the basis of these drivers. Professionals and policymakers can use this framework to help " greening " SMEs.Save to LibraryDownloadby Murk Peutz•SustainabilityLarge-scale involvement of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises not participating in Innovation NetworksCurrent public innovation stimulating activities often fail to activate a significant group of SMEs.

Key element is the active involvement of users. This case presents the needsfinding phase of an infrastructure project within the context of cycling. Since effectuation costs are high (roads and buildings are capital intensive), the need for focus (tackling the right user needs) is essential for funding of the lab. The needsfinding phase aims to generate user needs and wants, which is researched by investigating bicycle commuting intention. This is tested by use of the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). The results show convincingly that bicycle commuting intention can be explained by the variables of the TPB model (R 2 =.808). Within the context of a Living Lab, this model can be used as a very effective tool to stimulate behavioral change. These insights can be inspiring for innovation experts outside the area of cycling.Save to LibraryDownloadby Louise Savelkoul and +1Murk Peutz•  7  Theory of Planned Behaviour, Theory of Planned Behavior, Living Labs, AttitudesFinanciering van innovatie in MKB zelf aan invoering toeSave to Libraryby Murk Peutz•
