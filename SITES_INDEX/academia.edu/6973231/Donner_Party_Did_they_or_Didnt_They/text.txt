In truth, we know remarkably little about what actually happened to the starving travelers stranded in the Sierra Nevada in the winter of 1846–47. Combining the approaches of history, ethnohistory, archaeology, bioarchaeology, and social anthropology, this innovative look at the Donner Party’s experience at the Alder Creek Camp offers insights into many long-unsolved mysteries. Centered on archaeological investigations in the summers of 2003 and 2004 near Truckee, California, the book includes detailed analyses of artifacts and bones that suggest what life was like in this survival camp. Microscopic investigations of tiny bone fragments reveal butchery scars and microstructure that illuminate what the Donner families may have eaten before the final days of desperation, how they prepared what served as food, and whether they actually butchered and ate their deceased companions. The contributors reassess old data with new analytic techniques and, by examining both physical evidence and oral testimony from observers and survivors, add new dimensions to the historical narrative. The authors’ integration of a variety of approaches—including narratives of the Washoe Indians who observed the Donner Party—destroys some myths, deconstructs much of the folklore about the stranded party, and demonstrates that novel approaches can shed new light on events we thought we understood."Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of Anthropological ArchaeologyPerimortem Mutilation of Human Remains in an Early Village in the American Southwest: A Case For Ethnic Violence2010 • James M. PotterRecent excavations at the Sacred Ridge Site, just south of the town of Durango, Colorado, have uncovered the single largest deposit (to date) of mutilated and processed human remains in the American Southwest. This deposit dates to the very late eighth or very early ninth century A.D. and therefore represents an incidence of large-scale violence and perimortem mutilation dating to the Pueblo I period (A.D. 700– 900), when initial village formation occurred in the northern San Juan Region of the Southwest. Expectations for various interpretations for the Sacred Ridge assemblage are generated based on previous research and cross-cultural data on cannibalism, warfare, and human bone processing. Based on a lack of fit with previous models developed to account for extreme processing (EP) events, including starvation cannibalism, warfare and social intimidation, and witch-craft accusations, it is proposed that the Sacred Ridge massacre was the result of ethnic conflict during the Pueblo I period.Download Free PDFView PDFJoan Didion's California: Literary Representations of History, Melancholy and TransgressionsKatarzyna Nowak-McNeiceThis paper analyzes the representations of California's history, its peculiar brand of melancholy and transgressions of the official historical discourse in the oeuvre of Joan Didion.Download Free PDFView PDFHaving an old friend for dinner: cannibalism goes to the moviesDes  BellamyWhat (or whom) would you be willing to eat? My research examines anthropophagy (human cannibalism) in the movies: is it gratuitous and included for shock value, or does it cast light onto our most profound cultural and moral assumptions and taboos? Eating choices are determined by social and cultural identities, and normative gustatory practices vary widely between cultures, but reification or commodification of our proposed prey is standard. When applied to humans, it is shocking, because of our assumed, largely unexamined singularity. I examine how this is culturally inculcated in a selection of English-language feature films by looking at different iterations of anthropophagy – survivalism (necessitated by catastrophe or dystopian social collapse), the primitive savage of colonial discourses, the inhuman psychopath and the opportunistist. Incorporation of humans is abject, and disturbs our deepest social and cultural agreements. My research is driven by my animal activism and a desire to define and challenge the humanist, Cartesian, belief that humans are ontologically non-animal. Anthropophagy is, at its most basic, about treating humans as meat. I am using a critical paradigm, where assumed dualisms (e.g. human/animal, civilised/savage, sane/psychopathic) are deconstructed and examined through the plots and production techniques of selected films and the ways they’re received and interpreted. Interdisciplinary methodologies of film studies and cultural studies are used to examine how incidents are intensified or trivialised. Anthropophagy points to the need to limit voraciousness of appetite in a world reaching environmental resource saturation. I argue that the abjection experienced by viewers comes from abhorrence of the objectification of humans, and that the anthropophagous film unconsciously aids in deconstructing the human/animal binary and deobjectifying the sentient “other”, and thus recognising the damage done to the environment, our fellow creatures and each other through the use of the rhetoric of animality.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
