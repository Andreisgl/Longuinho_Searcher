Bangladesh experienced its largest dengue epidemic in 2019. Our objective was to investigate the epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory characteristics of the hospital-admitted dengue patients during this epidemic. Methods. This cross-sectional study was conducted among 369 adult dengue patients admitted to two tertiary care hospitals in Dhaka, Bangladesh, from June to September 2019. The disease severity was determined according to the WHO’s 2009 classification. Results. The average age of the patients was 33.3 (SD 14) years with a predominance of men. Almost 10% developed severe dengue (plasma leakage 67%, clinical bleeding 25%, and organ involvement 25%). Fever, headache, retro-orbital pain, diarrhea, and warning signs such as abdominal pain, clinical fluid accumulation, and persistent vomiting were the most common clinical presentations. Thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, elevated HCT levels, and ALT/AST were common laboratory findings. Conclusions. Severe dengue was...See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersBangladesh Journal of MedicineDengue Fever, Expanded Dengue Syndrome and Dengue Shock Syndrome: Clinical Profile, Management and Outcome of Patients at a Tertiary Hospital, Dhaka, Bangladesh2020 • Anowar  HossainBackground: Dengue fever is endemic in Bangladesh. Its incidence has been increasing and spreadingfrom urban Dhaka to rural areas. In 2019, over 100,000 cases reported with deaths over 250.Clinical profiles varied from classical signs and symptoms to alarming severity and complications,such as, Expanded Dengue Syndrome (EDS), Dengue Shock Syndrome (DSS) along with coinfectionsand comorbidities. No detail study on EDS & DSS carried out yet over 2019 outbreak. This reporthighlights the features, management and the outcome of EDS & DSS cases of 2018-19 admitted in aspecialized tertiary private hospital in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Methods: This cross sectional observational study was performed at Square Hospital, Dhaka,exclusively over 62 adult dengue patients with complications who fulfilled the admission criteria inICU and HDU and managed as per national guidelines and diagnosed by positive NS1 Ag, DengueRT PCR , Anti-dengue IgM, hematological and biochemical tests.

However, very few studies have reported atypical clinical features of dengue among children. Because an understanding of various spectrums of presentation of dengue is necessary for timely diagnosis and management, we aimed to document the typical and atypical clinical features along with predictors of severity among children with dengue during the largest outbreak in Bangladesh in 2019. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study between August 15 and September 30, 2019. in eight tertiary level hospitals in Dhaka city. Children (aged &lt; 15 years) with serologically confirmed dengue were conveniently selected for data collection through a structured questionnaire. Descriptive, inferential statistics, and multivariable logistic regression were used to analyze data. Results Among the 190 children (mean age 8.8 years, and male-female ratio 1.22:1) included in the analysis, respectively ...Download Free PDFView PDFCh-5.15 Dengue illnesses IAP TBP 7th EditionCh-5.15 Dengue illnesses IAP TBP 7th Edition2019 • Ashok  KapseNo abstractDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Dhaka Medical CollegePattern of Presentation and Organ Involvement in Dengue Fever at Dhaka Medical College HospitalImtiaz FaruqDengue fever first identified as ‘Dhaka Fever’ in 1964 & became endemic around 2000. The most recent spreading of dengue in 2019 was also notable for change in the presenting features of the patients attributed by some to the fact that causative virus might be of different serotype. Our study aims to assess the current pattern of presentation of dengue virus infection, done in inpatient of Department of Medicine of Dhaka Medical College Hospital Dhaka. This was a crosssectional, observational, descriptive study conducted between 1st August and 30th September 2019. A total 70 subjects, age &gt;12 years were included in this study. Among them 55 were male & 15 were female, with a mean age of 28.33(±12.15) years. Comorbidities noticed in few cases such as DM (2, 2.90%), HTN (3, 4.35%), IHD (1,1.45%), CKD & COPD (1,1.45%). The most common presentation were fever (64, 91.43%), headache (62, 88.57%) anorexia (59, 85.51%), generalised pain (51, 73.91%), nausea (49, 71.01%).

An alarming rise of dengue has also been seen in India during the recent years. Majority of dengue viral infections are self-limiting, but complications may cause high morbidity and mortality. Present study was undertaken with an objective of describing various clinical presentations as noted in our cohort of dengue patients and to evaluate the outcome of dengue fever.Methods: This retrospective study included all confirmed dengue cases below 18 years age admitted to Paediatric department of KIMS, Bengaluru over a period of 1 year in 2019. Medical records were reviewed and analysed. Those diagnosed to be positive for dengue serology (NS1 or IgM) were included in our study. Dengue was classified according to the WHO guidelines into 2 groups, Dengue fever (without/with warning signs) and Severe Dengue.

Dengue causes a wide spectrum of disease. This can range from subclinical disease (people may not know they are even infected) to severe flu-like symptoms in those infected. Although less common, some people develop severe dengue, which can be any number of complications associated with severe bleeding, organ impairment and/or plasma leakage. Severe dengue has a higher risk of death when not managed appropriately.Once infected, humans are the main carriers and multipliers of the virus, serving as a source of virus for the uninfected mosquitoes.In Nepal, monsoon season occurs during June – August every year. The dengue season closely follows this period with seasonal cases occurring between September and November. Given the presence of a largely susceptible human population, human movement, the presence of both Aedes vectors and all four dengue serotypes, this trend is unlikely to reverse over the coming decades. Indeed, the burden may continue to increase likely resulting in an increasing number of severeDownload Free PDFView PDFBangladesh Medical Research Council BulletinUltrasonographic assessment of dengue fever and its correlation with platelet countMahmood JahanBackground: Dengue virus infections are a significant threat to human populations particularly in the tropical and subtropical regions. This is mainly transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquito from humans to humans. The main pathological mechanisms associated include thrombocytopenia, haemorrhagic diathesis with haemoconcentration. Ultrasonography is used because of its ability to detect plasma leakage signs and prediction of disease severity. Objective: To evaluate the usefulness of ultrasonographic findings of dengue fever and its correlation with platelet count. Methods: It was a prospective observational study, carried out in Bangladesh Medical College Hospital, Dhaka from May 2019 to August 2019. A total of 213 patients of suspected dengue fever during the epidemic were included in this study. All the cases were serologically diagnosed and evaluated with ultrasonographic findings.
