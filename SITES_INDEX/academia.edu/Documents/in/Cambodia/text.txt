This policy brief discusses the readiness of Khemarak Phumin city in Koh Kong province and provides policy recommendations to better cope with impacts of climate change and natural disasters. Our assessment finds that the city might not be ready should a big hazard such as a storm or flood strikes. This vulnerability is caused by an absence of an early warning system, a responsible specialized agency at the city level, an evacuation route and safe areas for an emergency, and a reserve emergency fund. It is thus important that the city invests in these critical mechanisms.Save to LibraryDownloadby Soriya Yin•  10  Geography, Climate Change, Cambodia, Disaster PreparednessFour human Plasmodium species quantification using droplet digital PCRSave to LibraryDownloadby Laurent Rénia•  20  Genetics, Cambodia, Biology, AdolescentHome of Lord Vishnu on Earth BhoologaReclining Vishnu from Prasat Western Mebon, Angkor.

Made of Bronze, statue is from 11th century and currently on display at the National Museum of Cambodia. Vaikuntham or Vaikuntha is not just a name it is a description of the home of Lord Vishnu the patron Saint or Giod of Angkorean temples specifically Angkor Wat. Angkor Wat is one of the largest monuments in the world in northern Cambodia. Angkor Wat's temple is located in the city of Karong CM Reap in Cambodia. Ankorwat Temple used to be a temple of Hinduism, later it was made a place of pilgrimage for Budhist religion. Angkor Wat, temple complex at Angkor, near Siĕmréab, Cambodia, that was built in the 12th century by King Suryavarman II (reigned 1113-c. 1150). The vast religious complex of Angkor Wat comprises more than a thousand buildings, and it is one of the great cultural wonders of the world.Save to LibraryDownloadby Dr. Uday Dokras•VaikunthaDietary Iron Intake and Availability in Hill Tribe and Urban Women, Chiang Rai Province, Northern ThailandSave to LibraryDownloadby Carol Hutchinson•  6  Geography, Nutrition and Dietetics, Medicine, TribePositive deviance as a novel tool in malaria control and elimination: methodology, qualitative assessment and future potentialPositive deviance (PD) is an asset-based, community-driven approach to behaviour change that has successfully been applied to address many health and social problems.

It is yet to have been assessed for malaria control but may represent a promising tool for malaria elimination given its suitability in targeting small and remote population groups, apparent sustainability and ability to instil a high amount of community mobilisation. Here, the PD methodology as applied to malaria is explained, with focus upon and qualitative assessment of a proof of concept study in Cambodia. Three villages in Battambang, northwestern Cambodia were selected for the intervention, with an estimated population of 5036 including both residents and migrant workers. In August 2010, field teams conducted a 1 week PD process to sensitise and mobilise the community, establish normative behaviours in relation to malaria control and prevention, identify positive deviant behaviours from within the community, and ...Save to LibraryDownloadby Myo Min•  13  Focus Groups, Cambodia, Medical Microbiology, MalariaRegional Conflict Management: Challenges of the Border Disputes of Cambodia, Laos, and VietnamThis study analyzes the border disputes of Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam, respectively.

Building on the “powers of exclusion” framework developed by Hall, Hirsch and Li, we show how irrigation reshapes socio-spatial configurations locally and reinforces the dynamics of social differentiation between smallholder farmers. We argue that the uneven geography of water and the transformation of land ownership structures to which the irrigation project in question contributes run in the opposite direction of a pathway that would support the development of inclusive pro-smallholder irrigation.Save to LibraryDownloadby Try Thuon•  5  Irrigation, Cambodia, Exclusion, Land MarketReview of Rice Policies in China, Thailand and VietnamChina, Thailand, and Vietnam are key players in world rice market in terms of production and trade.

In the past few decades, rice policies in these three countries have changed significantly resulted in changes in production, exports and influences in the world market. This paper reviews major rice policy reforms in China, Thailand and Vietnam during past five decades. It is observed that although each country has practiced different policies at different periods, with the economic development, individuals and market forces have played more important roles in domestic market while government interventions still exist and it is important for the government to invest in rice breeding technology and infrastructure construction. It was found that China and Vietnam have benefited from farm system reforms, the adoption of hybrid rice and the investment in irrigation while liberalization of rice export premium and provision of credits in 1980s have helped Thailand to become the largest ric...Save to LibraryDownloadby Mai Phương Bùi•  6  Business, China, Production economics, RiceSocial Media and Proselytizing of Islam: A Study of Muslim Students in Selected Higher Institutions of Learning in Northern NigeriaSave to LibraryDownloadby Muhammad Maga Sule•  2  Political Science, IslamViolence: A ReaderSave to LibraryDownloadby Catherine Besteman•A STUDY ON THE STATUS, PROBLEMS AND COUNTERMEASURES OF SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED ENTERPRISES (SMEs) IN CAMBODIASMEs play a crucial role in the economic development of the country, contributing significantly to employment generation and poverty reduction.

This study aims to investigate the current status, problems, and potential countermeasures of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Cambodia by providing an in-depth analysis of their current status and challenges. The proposed countermeasures offer valuable insights for policymakers, industry associations, and development agencies to design effective strategies and programs that can foster the growth and development of SMEs in the country. SMEs in Cambodia face challenges such as limited access to finance, lack of comprehensive databases, low levels of R&D expenditures, insufficient use of information technology, inadequate institutional support, bureaucratic hurdles, and skills gaps among the workforce. These challenges hinder their ability to scale up, innovate, and compete in both domestic and international markets. To address these challenges and promote SMEs growth, several policy recommendations are suggested. Improving access to finance can be achieved through innovative financing solutions like credit guarantee schemes and microfinance. Comprehensive databases on SMEs should be established to better understand their needs and design targeted support measures. Incentives for R&D and innovation, as well as the promotion of information technology adoption, should be provided. The business environment can be strengthened by reducing bureaucratic red tape, enhancing the legal framework, and promoting fair competition. Skills training programs for entrepreneurs and employees, investing in infrastructure, fighting corruption, strengthening institutional support, and enhancing human capital development are also important strategies. Promoting innovation and technology adoption through access to digital tools, innovation hubs, and R&D support, as well as fostering collaboration between SMEs, universities, and research institutions, are crucial for SMEs success in Cambodia. It is hoped that this research will contribute to the overall economic development of Cambodia and create a favorable business environment for SMEs to thrive.Save to LibraryDownloadby Meng Kheang Sorn•“Digital Health Diplomacy” in Global Digital Health?

The COVID-reinforced need for accelerated digital health progress will require political structures and processes to build a foundation for Global Digital Health. Simultaneously, Global Health Diplomacy uses digital technologies in its enactment. Both phenomena have driven interest in the term “Digital Health Diplomacy.” A review of the literature revealed 2 emerging but distinct definitions that have been published very recently, each with its associated discourse and practice. This multiplicity of ideas demonstrates the myriad ways in which global digital and political systems are becoming increasingly entangled. Untangling these, this paper proposes and discusses 3 dimensions of Digital Health Diplomacy: “Diplomacy for digital health,” “Digital health for diplomacy,” and “Digital health in diplomacy.” It calls upon digital health professionals, diplomats, political and social...Save to LibraryDownloadby Siaw-Teng Liaw•  9  Engineering, Computer Science, Political Science, Public RelationsHTTP://OJS.WPRO.WHO.INT/OJS/INDEX.PHP/WPSAR/ARTICLE/VIEW/328/616Save to LibraryDownloadby Huong Ngo•  9  Biology, Virology, Vietnam, PhylogenyEpidemiology of forest malaria in central Vietnam: a large scale cross-sectional surveyIn Vietnam, a large proportion of all malaria cases and deaths occurs in the central mountainous and forested part of the country.

Indeed, forest malaria, despite intensive control activities, is still a major problem which raises several questions about its dynamics.A large-scale malaria morbidity survey to measure malaria endemicity and identify important risk factors was carried out in 43 villages situated in a forested area of Ninh Thuan province, south central Vietnam. Four thousand three hundred and six randomly selected individuals, aged 10-60 years, participated in the survey. Rag Lays (86%), traditionally living in the forest and practising &quot;slash and burn&quot; cultivation represented the most common ethnic group. The overall parasite rate was 13.3% (range [0-42.3] while Plasmodium falciparum seroprevalence was 25.5% (range [2.1-75.6]).

However, differences in severity between these pathogens have been noted, suggesting the degree of illness may vary in different populations. Moreover, a potential association between hMPV and asthma also suggests that hMPV may preferentially affect asthmatic subjects. Methods In a population-based surveillance study in children aged &lt;2 years admitted for severe LRTI in Argentina, nasopharyngeal aspirates were tested by RT-PCR for hMPV, RSV, influenza A, and human rhinovirus. Results Of 3947 children, 383 (10%) were infected with hMPV. The hospitalization rate for hMPV LRTI was 2.26 per 1000 children (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.04–2.49). Thirty-nine (10.2%) patients infected with hMPV experienced life-threatening disease (LTD; 0.23 per 1000 children; 95% CI, .16–.31/1000), and 2 died (mortality rate 0.024 per 1000;...Save to LibraryDownloadby Eduardo Bergel•  15  Asthma, Infectious Diseases, Medicine, Biological SciencesSupporting stakeholders to anticipate and respond to risks in a Mekong River water-energy-food nexusSave to LibraryDownloadby andrea betancourt•  12  Business, Participatory Research, Resilience, CambodiaOverlapping zones of exclusion: carbon markets, corporate hydropower enclaves and timber extraction in CambodiaSave to LibraryDownloadby Try Thuon•  16  Business, Sociology, Anthropology, Political EcologyThe framing and governance of climate change adaptation projects in Lao PDR and CambodiaSave to LibraryDownloadby Try Thuon•  5  Law, Climate Change, Climate Change Adaptation, Corporate GovernanceWhat is a Green Economy?

Yet, internationally, there is very little empirically based research on how the “green development” agenda translates into natural resource management policies in the least developed countries. This paper examines the implementation of green economy policies at the national level in the energy and forestry sectors in the Lao PDR and Cambodia. Both countries have adopted green growth targets; however, in terms of natural resources management, two contradictory processes have taken place during the past decade. While there have been some initiatives to decentralize natural resource management by enhancing the role of local communities role, such as community-based forest or fishery management, the far greater trend has been the opening up of the economies of the Lao PDR and Cambodia to lar...Save to LibraryDownloadby Try Thuon•  15  Business, Forestry, Sustainable Development, EnergyPrevalence and Predictors of Tobacco Use Among Asian Americans in the Delaware Valley RegionObjectives.

A cross-sectional survey design was used. The sample consisted of 1174 Chinese, Koreans, Vietnamese, and Cambodians. Results. Findings indicated that the mean age at initiation of tobacco use was 18.3 years. Among the respondents, 40.2% had a history of tobacco use, and 29.6% were current users. Men were more likely than women to smoke. There were significant differences between never smokers, current smokers, and ex-smokers in sex, ethnicity, educational attainment, and marital and employment status. Conclusions. The findings suggest that tobacco use is still a serious public health problem among Asian Americans, especially men.Save to LibraryDownloadby Shikha Jain•  20  Demography, Health Behavior, Cambodia, ChinaReview of O.

Indonesia is a prime example. But while poverty has declined in Indonesia, one of its worst impacts-nutritional insecurity-remains high, particularly in rural areas. Patterns of food poverty persist across Indonesia, despite a fall in poverty rates. What explains this troubling paradox? How does it relate to Indonesia's enthusiastic embrace of the 'entitlements revolution', the use of direct cash transfers as a tool for reducing poverty and building social inclusion?This book analyses the nature and social consequences of economic development and agrarian change processes in rural Indonesia in relation to the scope and effectiveness of Indonesia's social protection programs. The findings are based on a series of extensive 'ground-up' case studies in Indonesian communities in a variety of eco-agrarian settings, seeking to understand the drivers of insecurity and vulnerability at a household level. The results show that while high value farming, diversification and migration may offer a means of economic progress for poor households, economic growth also creates the conditions for increasing inequality, nutritional insecurity and ecological decline.This is due to the way class, gender and power work in remote local contexts, and the fact that much surplus income is used for enhanced consumption and changing lifestyles. To understand why nutritional  insecurity and stunting patterns persist, we need to appreciate how rural change occurs. In many cases there are few signs of the classical structural transformation of the countryside which is considered the most decisive pathway out of rural poverty.The authors conclude that, while social assistance softens the experience of poverty, they generate targeting problems, produce new patterns of inclusion and exclusion and provoke a contentious politics of distribution. New strategies are required to address food poverty and nutritional insecurity and provide acceptable ways of assisting the poor.Save to LibraryDownloadby John F McCarthy•Mexican Psychiatric Trainees’ Attitudes Towards People with Mental Illness: A Qualitative StudyDespite their training, psychiatrists have been found to have negative attitudes towards people with mental illness, including the patients they treat.

Similarly, studies focused on service users have identified psychiatrists as a source of stigma. Even though negative attitudes in psychiatrists have been identified in different countries and settings, in Mexico the attitudes of these professionals have never been assessed. Because of this, we invited psychiatric trainees from a hospital in Mexico to participate in individual interviews to describe their opinions regarding mental health-related stigma, to evaluate their attitudes towards people with mental illness and to identify factors that could be influencing their attitudes. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed and analysed using thematic analysis. A total of 29 trainees participated in the study.

Human rights aspects remain critical either to liberate or to abolish sex trafficking. Radical feminist perspective defends the argument to eliminate sex trafficking due to the existence of physical abuses and sexual harassment within the sex industry and the cycle of sex trafficking. Contrastingly, liberal feminist also making efforts in liberating the rights of women to seek a job to be sex workers due to women’s autonomy and rational choice as well as the influence of global capitalist system. Such debates, furthermore, cannot be distinguished from the influence of the rooted theories, for instance, postcolonial feminism which argue that sex trafficking is inevitable notably for the colonised countries since the women are triggered to seek for decent income through migrating to another country.

In Australia, 1983 was a big year in many ways – the Ash Wednesday fires ripped through Victoria and South Australia killing 71 people, the Hawke Government was elected in March, Australia II won the ‘Auld Mug’ from the Yanks, the nation’s first case of AIDS was reported and if one could afford a new car, it was often a Holden Kingswood. Perhaps more profound than many realised at the time, was the decision in December 1983 to float the Australian dollar by Treasurer, Paul Keating.Coincidentally, 2013 also marks the 20th anniversary of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (HREOC) Inquiry into The Human Rights of People with a Mental Illness. 1993 was the year Paul Keating won the unwinnable Federal election, Sydney was announced as host city for the 2000 Olympic Games, two great Australians, Edward ‘Weary’ Dunlop and Fred Hollows, passed away, unemployment was nearly at 11% over the full year and again, more fundamental for the nation in many respects, the Native Title Act came into law following the High Court’s Mabo decision.When the Human Rights Commissioner, Brian Burdekin, commenced his Inquiry in 1990, there was no national approach or strategy in relation to mental health. By the time Burdekin had finished, all Australian Governments had signed off on a National Mental Health Statement of Rights and Responsibilities (1991), a National Mental Health Policy (1992) and a 5-year National Mental Health Plan (January 1993).The rationale for this Report is simple. The move to deinstitutionalisation is arguably one of the most important public policy ‘decisions’ 1 of the post-war era in Australia. It has had profound impacts on our society and most particularly those affected by mental illness and their families and the mental health workforce. The Richmond and Burdekin reports did not signal the end of mental health reform. They were more likely to start the reform. The aim of this report is to examine what has followed. There have been dozens of inquiries, reports, plans, policies and strategies since 1993, some national, some by the states and territories. Despite all these plans and even the more recent high level engagement of the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) since 2006, this Report asks “How different things really are from when they were originally reported by Richmond and Burdekin, a generation ago?”While some positive changes are clear, there are still far too many reports of service issues and failures when it comes to mental health – “Too many people falling through the cracks”. Despite unequivocal commitments by all State governments in 1992 and reaffirmed in 1998, there are still hundreds of people nationally in every state jurisdiction except Victoria, languishing in institutional settings. We estimate this to be costing taxpayers more than $10 million a week. The life expectancy of people with mental illness has not improved. People with schizophrenia have the same life expectancy as remote Indigenous Australians, but there is no ‘Closing the Gap’ strategy for schizophrenia.As we now reflect on what has changed since Richmond and Burdekin, Australia’s failure to lift the life expectancy of people with a mental illness is arguably the starkest indictment of our public policy failure in relation to mental health care.Save to LibraryDownloadby John Mendoza•  3  Mental Health, Public Health Policy, Mental health reformSoil Carbon Stock in Cambodian Monsoon ForestsSave to LibraryDownloadby Mamoru Kanzaki•  5  Environmental Science, Evergreen Forest, Deciduous, EvergreenNote sur la piété filiale en Asie du Sud-Est theravādin : La notion de « guṇ »Save to LibraryDownloadby Gregory Kourilsky•  3  Sociology, Philosophy, HumanitiesThe rock temples of CambodiaThe rock temples of CambodiaSave to LibraryDownloadby Dr. Uday Dokras•  2  Harem, Angkor WatStructural Basis For HIV-1 DNA Integration in the Human GenomeSave to LibraryDownloadby Denis Moras•  9  Biophysical Chemistry, Biological Sciences, DNA, Physical sciencesA qualitative exploration of the sexual and reproductive health knowledge of adolescent mothers from indigenous populations in Ratanak Kiri Province, CambodiaSave to LibraryDownloadby Elizabeth Hoban•  17  Psychology, Nursing, Sexual and Reproductive Health, Indigenous HealthA longitudinal study on the prevalence of iron deficiency anemia in the multiethnic communities of Jhargram, West BengalAnemia is a significant public health concern in India, with an esti-mated prevalence of 38% to 82% in non-pregnant females and 18% to 59% in males.

Population growth, technological advancements in communication systems, hyper-commercialization, interdependent financial networks, near constant transportation improvements, corporate consolidation via mergers and acquisitions and the adoption of English as the lingua franca have all led to an increase in cross border employment realities. Essentially, the world has become one giant marketplace and Asia, with the largest global population, is preparing for the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC). The economic integration is not limited to capital goods, information or technology.

Results were compared to spectrophotometry (Procedure 345, Trinity Biotech, Ireland). Sensitivity and specificity were calculated for each test with cut-off activities of 10%, 20%, 30% and 60% of the adjusted male median. The adjusted male median was 270.5 IU/1012 RBC.

At 30% G6PD activity, sensitivity for the FST was between 87.7% (95%CI: 76.8% to 93.9%) and ...Save to LibraryDownloadby Benedikt Ley•  17  Malaria, Philippines, Adolescent, MedicineThe challenges of introducing routine G6PD testing into radical cure: a workshop reportThe only currently available drug that effectively removes malaria hypnozoites from the human host is primaquine.

The use of 8-aminoquinolines is hampered by haemolytic side effects in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficient individuals. Recently a number of qualitative and a quantitative rapid diagnostic test (RDT) format have been developed that provide an alternative to the current standard G6PD activity assays. The WHO has recently recommended routine testing of G6PD status prior to primaquine radical cure whenever possible. A workshop was held in the Philippines in early 2015 to discuss key challenges and knowledge gaps that hinder the introduction of routine G6PD testing. Two point-of-care (PoC) test formats for the measurement of G6PD activity are currently available: qualitative tests comparable to malaria RDT as well as biosensors that provide a quantitative reading. Qualitative G6PD PoC tests provide a binomial test result, are easy to use and some products are ...Save to LibraryDownloadby Benedikt Ley•  13  Medical Microbiology, Malaria, Medicine, HumansRendering land investible: Five notes on timeIn this comment, I want to further probe the temporality of rendering land investible.

Temporality is implicit in the analytic of assemblage I deployed in my essay "What is Land" to expose land's provisional quality (Li 2014). If land becomes a resource available for global investment through the assemblage of heterogenous elements (material substances, technologies, discourses and practices), the arrangement of these elements cannot but shape-shift over time. More obviously, time is key to the future orientation of investment. My essay explored how this orientation was produced through graphs of "yield gaps,"  maps of  "underutilized land," diagrams of impending food crisis, and charts comparing risk and encouraging investors to act fast. Stimulated in part by reading the articles in this special issue, I offer some more explicit reflections on land-and-time in the form of five brief notes.Save to LibraryDownloadby Tania Li•  4  Land tenure, Temporality, Investment, Land GrabbingA Unique Śaṅkhalipi (Shell-script) Inscription from Si Thep, Thailand; with Richard SalomonInscriptions in the highly calligraphic and still undeciphered śaṅkhalipi or 'shell script' have been found by the hundreds in most parts of India except the far south, typically in conjunction with sites and monuments dating from around... moreInscriptions in the highly calligraphic and still undeciphered śaṅkhalipi or 'shell script' have been found by the hundreds in most parts of India except the far south, typically in conjunction with sites and monuments dating from around the Gupta period and succeeding centuries. To date, four specimens have also been discovered in the Indonesian archipelago, in West Java and West Kalimantan (Borneo). Another specimen of śaṅkhalipi inscription, engraved on a pillar and exceptionally ornate, was recently discovered in Thailand at the site of Si Thep, a moated early settlement in Phetchabun Province. The article reviews the historical and cultural contexts of shell-script inscriptions in India and discusses the significance of this remarkable first specimen found in mainland Southeast Asia.Save to LibraryDownloadby Nicolas Revire•  5  Archaeology, Southeast Asian Studies, Thailand, EpigraphyBergayuh Agar Tak Lumpuh: Proyeksi Peran ASEAN dalam Penyelesaian Isu Semenanjung KoreaAs a regional organization, ASEAN has responsibility to solve the problem in Korean Peninsula.

ASEAN’s involvement in effort to solve the problem in Korean Peninsula can be seen by the existence of ARF. Besides ARF, ASEAN also has many cooperations with other parties-involved that can be exploited as an instrument to solve the problem. However, ASEAN’s involvement only limited to the providing forum (ARF) for the parties involved in the problem. The limitation of ASEAN is interesting to discuss since it proved to be fail to provide concrete outcome. This writtings try to find the reasons behind the inability of ASEAN to solve the problem. Specifically, this writtings use the concept of bandwagon to analyse the cause of the limitation. The main argument of this writing is the inability of ASEAN is caused by bandwagon behavior of ASEAN countries to great power that involved in this problem.Keywords: ASEAN, Korean Peninsula, bandwagonSave to LibraryDownloadby Rizki Ananda•  3  Political Science, Shandong Peninsula, peninsulaNextLast »Related TopicsSoutheast Asian StudiesFollowFollowingCambodian HistoryFollowFollowingLaos (Lao PDR)FollowFollowingSoutheast AsiaFollowFollowingKhmer StudiesFollowFollowingCambodian ArchaeologyFollowFollowingSoutheast Asian historyFollowFollowingThailandFollowFollowingLaos and CambodiaFollowFollowingPolitical Violence in Cambodia & the Khmer RougeFollowFollowing 71.6 million researchers use this site every month.
