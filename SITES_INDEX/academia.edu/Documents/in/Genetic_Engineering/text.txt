Çünkü tıp teknolojisinin yeni icatları, bu sorudaki ümidi besliyor. Hayata ve ölüme dair anlayışımız da değişiyor. Artık “ölme hakkı”ndan, “yaşama hakkı”ndan bahsediyoruz. Halbuki ölmek ya da yaşamak bir kaderdir, bir kaçınılmazlıktır. Bütün kadim anlayışlarda bu böyledir. Günümüzde biyoteknoloji hayatın ve ölümün sınırlarında geziniyor. Bu kaçınılmazlıkları aşma hırsıyla. O yüzden hem “ölümde iyi”yi (ötenazi) hem de “doğumda iyi”yi (öjenik) tartışıyoruz.On dokuzuncu yüzyılda evrimci biyoloji, insan-hayvan arasındaki farkı ortadan kaldırmıştı. Günümüzdeyse biyo-teknik ve gen mühendisliği makine-insan arasındaki sınırı belirsiz hale getirdi. Biyonikler, yapay zeka, genetik kopyalama gibi metotlar nedeniyle artık insanın sınırları tartışmalı hale geldi.Eğer insanın bir kutsiyeti ve doğası yoksa, onu biteviye değiştirmemize, yapay organlarla takviye etmemize, embriyoya müdahale ederek üstün nitelikli insan ya da insan-hayvan-makine arası bir varlık inşa etmemize ne engel olabilir?Bilim kendi amacını tayin edebilir mi? “Bilimsel” tavır, ölü bedenlere ya da embriyolara sadece birer hücre yığınıymışçasına muamele edilmesini meşrulaştırabilir mi?Bu kitap, kader ile tasarım arasında salınan “yeni insan”ı bu sorular eşliğinde tartışmaya açıyor.Save to LibraryDownloadby Nazife Şişman•  15  Life Sciences, Sociology of the Body, Sociology of Technology, Genetic EngineeringProspects of vitamin d in the treatment of covid-19 patient and improving maternal and child health during pandemicThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is supposed to cause vitamin D deficiency in many people by a direct effect of home quarantine in the affected countries.

Generally, vitamin D provides human body with significant health benefits including bone development, specific gene regulation and protection against different diseases. However, deficiency of optimal amount of vitamin D inside human body may result in susceptibility to multiple infectious diseases. Therefore, with vitamin D levels gravely decreased by reduced movement and activity, a number of possible negative outcomes are expected in COVID-19 patients, pregnant women and children during this ongoing pandemic. Vitamin D has a direct inhibitory effect on post infection through a number of mechanisms that promises to make vitamin D a future adjunctive therapy for COVID-19 treatment. Besides, clinical evidence also supports its role in preventing pregnancy complications and improving pregnancy outcomes.

The difficulty in studying Chlamydia spp., Coxiella spp., Rickettsia spp., Anaplasma spp., Ehrlichia spp. and Orientia spp. is, in part, due to their genetic intractability. Recently, genetic tools have been developed; however, optimizing the genomic manipulation of obligate intracellular bacteria remains challenging. In this Review, we describe the progress in, as well as the constraints that hinder, the systematic development of a genetic toolbox for obligate intracellular bacteria. We highlight how the use of genetically manipulated pathogens has facilitated a better understanding of microbial pathogenesis and immunity, and how the engineering of obligate intracellular bacteria could enable the discovery of novel signalling circuits in host-pathogen interactions.Save to LibraryDownloadby Raphael Valdivia•  7  Microbiology, Medical Microbiology, Genetic Engineering, HumansEU regulation concerning genetically modified products: an issue of food security or a measure of disguised protectionism?Save to LibraryDownloadby José  Caetano•  13  European Union, Food Security, Genetic Engineering, LegislationHigh-level expression of bioactive recombinant human lysozyme in the milk of transgenic mice using a modified human lactoferrin BACSave to LibraryDownloadby Marcelo Foti•  19  Engineering, Technology, Biotechnology, Western blottingL’ingénierie des génomes par les TALENSave to LibraryDownloadby Barbara Dupret•  6  DNA repair, Genetic Engineering, DNA, HumansPrecision genome editing: a small revolution for glycobiologyPrecise and stable gene editing in mammalian cell lines has until recently been hampered by the lack of efficient targeting methods.

While different gene silencing strategies have had tremendous impact on many biological fields, they have generally not been applied with wide success in the field of glycobiology, primarily due to their low efficiencies, with resultant failure to impose substantial phenotypic consequences upon the final glycosylation products. Here, we review novel nuclease-based precision genome editing techniques enabling efficient and stable gene editing, including gene disruption, insertion, repair, modification and deletion. The nuclease-based techniques comprised of homing endonucleases, zinc finger nucleases, transcription activator-like effector nucleases, as well as the RNA-guided clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat/Cas nuclease system, all function by introducing single or double-stranded breaks at a defined genomic sequence.

The recent characterization of different lignification genes has stimulated research programmes aimed at modifying the lignin profiles of plants through genetic engineering (antisense and sense suppression of gene expression). The first transgenic plants with a modification of monomeric composition of lignins and lignin content have been recently obtained. Down regulation of the OMT gene induces dramatic reduction of syringyl units. CAD down regulated plants exhibit a unusual red phenotype associated with the developing xylem and several chemical modifications of their lignins including an increase in cinnamaldehydes in the polymer structure. Interestingly this novel lignin is removed more easily during the pulping process. In both OMT and CAD down regulated plants no changes in phenotypic characteristics such as growth architecture and morphology were observed. More recent experiments have shown that a reduction of CCR activity determines specific changes in the coloration of the xylem area suggesting significant chemical modifications which are currently being studied. These different results show that it is possible to manipulate lignins through targeted genetic transformation of plants and that lignins exhibit a relative flexibility of their chemical structure. Future developments should probe the impact of down regulating the expression of other recently characterized lignification genes such as F5H and CCoAOMT and also of a combination of genes in order to tailor lignins more adapted to specific purposes. In addition to biotechnological applications which should provide important economical benefits for utilization of wood in the pulp industry, genetic engineering of lignins offer very promising perspectives for the understanding of lignin synthesis, structure and properties.Save to LibraryDownloadby jacqueline Grima-Pettenati•  8  Plant Biology, Molecular Breeding, Gene expression, Genetic EngineeringRecombinant DNA Approaches to Feline Leukemia Virus ImmunizationWe have utilized 2 recombinant DNA strategies for immunization against FeLV in cats: (a) modified live virus was attenuated by mutation and recombination, and (b) an immunogen, consisting of subunit envelope protein, was prepared in... moreWe have utilized 2 recombinant DNA strategies for immunization against FeLV in cats: (a) modified live virus was attenuated by mutation and recombination, and (b) an immunogen, consisting of subunit envelope protein, was prepared in genetically engineered yeast. Results indicated that the genetically manipulated live virus preparations were not protective against FeLV challenge because they were either not attenuated in virulence or were not sufficiently antigenic. Immunization with yeast-synthesized FeLV envelope protein followed by the modified live virus gave protective immunity in cats under experimental conditions. Future immunization attempts will concentrate on enhancing the immunogenic potency of the yeast- synthesized FeLV envelope protein.Save to Libraryby Paul Luciw•  7  Leukemia, Recombinant DNA Technology, Cats, Genetic EngineeringAssembly of Nanomaterials Through Highly Ordered Self-Assembled Monolayers and Peptide-Organic Hybrid Conjugates as TemplatesSave to LibraryDownloadby Hadi Zareie•  20  Engineering, Organic Chemistry, Technology, ElectronicsNextLast »Related TopicsMolecular BiologyFollowFollowingImmunologyFollowFollowingBiotechnologyFollowFollowingBioinformaticsFollowFollowingMolecular GeneticsFollowFollowingGeneticsFollowFollowingPlant biotechnologyFollowFollowingGenomicsFollowFollowingPlant Molecular BiologyFollowFollowingPlant breeding and geneticsFollowFollowing 71.6 million researchers use this site every month.
