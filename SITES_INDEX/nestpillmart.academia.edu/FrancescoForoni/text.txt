Le recenti ricerche di neuroscienze cognitive hanno dimostrato che il cibo è in grado di attivare i circuiti cerebrali associati alla ricompensa e al desiderio, agendo quindi come una ricompensa naturale per il nostro cervello. Inoltre, sono state individuate similitudini tra dipendenza da cibo e dipendenza da altre sostanze d’abuso: in entrambi i casi, il funzionamento del circuito cerebrale della ricompensa risulta alterato. Un’altra capacità che risulta essere alterata nei disturbi alimentari è il controllo inibitorio. Infatti, in un ambiente come quello odierno, ricco di cibi ad alto contenuto calorico, è importante riuscire ad inibire la spinta verso la gratificazione generata dal consumo di questi cibi particolarmente appetitosi. Le persone che presentano buone capacità di autocontrollo mostrano attivazioni cerebrali diverse dalle persone con scarso autocontrollo, e queste differenze si ripercuotono sulle scelte alimentari. La dipendenza da cibo però è da considerarsi un caso speciale nello studio delle dipendenze, in quanto, come la dipendenza da altre sostanze d’abuso, presenta alterazioni dei circuiti cerebrali della ricompensa e dell’inibizione ma, a differenza delle altre sostanze, il cibo rappresenta un elemento necessario alla sopravvivenza.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This effect has been suggested to apply to different domains beyond human faces and evaluative dimensions beyond attractiveness. The current review will answer to the subsequent questions. Is there evidence of the Cheerleader Effect? What are the moderating factors of the Cheerleader Effect? What is the effect size? Has the Cheerleader Effect been tested on different types of stimuli (e.g., object: houses) other than faces? Does the cheerleader effect emerge only when rating attractiveness? Are there any consistent moderating factors? To date, there has been no reviews on the Cheerleader Effect. As this will be the first review on the Cheerleader Effect, we want to investigate this emerging concept and synthesise all the available information. The current review is interested in identifying studies that examine how the presentation of an object (e.g., faces) impacts an individual&#39;s perception and evaluation of it (e.g., in terms of attractiveness). Specifically, these studies must have the following paradigm: participants must evaluate an object when presented in a group setting vs when presented in isolation. The current review will obtain a meta analytic estimate of the effect size of this effect and test for moderators of the effect such as: Stimulus type (face vs other), evaluative dimension (attractiveness vs other), presentation modalities (stimulus present vs no longer present at the time of judgement)Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

They were tested in a satiated state before surgery in on medication, and after surgery in on medication/off stimulation and on medication/on stimulation. All participants were asked to complete a self-report questionnaire about impulsiveness, a go-no-go experiment measuring the response inhibition to food items and finally, a task that evaluates hedonic and motivational aspects of food processing (liking and wanting, respectively). The preoperative and postoperative body weights were recorded. The mean body weight of patients increased postoperatively. Both reward sensitivity and impulsivity increased after surgery. The weight changes correlated positively with hedonic ratings of food items and salience/motivation towards foods in on medication/on stimulation, in particular for non-sweet foods (both high and low calorie foods).

We hypothesized and showed that subliminally presented happy expressions lead to more positive judgments of cartoons compared to angry expressions only when facial muscles were not blocked. These results reveal the influence of socially driven embodied processes on affective judgments and have also potential implications for phenomena such as emotional contagion.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The present study analysed this almost unexplored phenomenon and tested whether intergroup threat enhances the tendency to generalise the members of a negatively-valued outgroup (i.e., Roma) onto another larger (partially) inclusive outgroup (i.e., Romanians). Evidence showed that Roma are generalised to Romanians to a higher extent under realistic and symbolic threat conditions.

Food Perception and Categorization: From Food/No-Food to Different Types of FoodThe ability to categorize food and nonfood correctly and to distinguish between different foods i... more The ability to categorize food and nonfood correctly and to distinguish between different foods is essential for our survival. Because of our omnivore nature and because of the food-rich environment in which we live, categorization processes involving food are particularly complex. The extent of the literature on this subject is an indication of our limited understanding of the mental processes underlying food perception, categorization, and choice. The ability to categorize food requires integration of multisensory information and semantic memory with varying contextual information and is modulated by numerous factors. On the one hand, food features (e.g., energy content, level of transformation) modulate our perceptual and categorization processes; on the other hand, categorization processes are also modulated by the perceiver’s temporary states (e.g., internal states such as hunger) and more lasting characteristics (e.g., body mass index, gender).

Yet, the underlying neural processes implicated in these daily food choices are still poorly understood. A spontaneous preference for cooked food compared to raw in hominids has been hypothesized based on animal models [2]. Indeed both mice [3] and great apes [4] showed preferences towards processed food. In particular, the control of fire for cooking food has been relevant for human evolution as transformed food generally contains more calories and therefore provides greater energy. In addition, some food can be dangerous if eaten raw, and cooking reduces the risk of infections. The present study comprises two experiments that aimed at testing the nature of implicit and explicit evaluations towards natural and transformed food in young normal-weight individuals. Implicit preferences were assessed using the Implicit Association Test (IAT; [5]). This is a response latency task providing a measure of strengths of automatic associations between target concepts and attributes. The concept dimension was represented by food/utensils and the attribute dimension by positive/negative. Participants were then asked to explicitly rate the general valence and wanting of the food images of the IAT task. Results of both experiments showed how at the implicit level participants had strong positive associations towards food items compared to tools. At the explicit level participants prefer natural food and foods containing low calories. Gender differences as expected emerged and hunger level of participants correlated positively solely with the wanting of transformed food. This study sheds light on an unexplored dimension of food categorization in humans to date.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

However, overconsumption of heavily-processed foods leads to imbalanced calorie intakes as well as negative health consequences and environmental impacts. In the present study, normal-weight healthy individuals were recruited in order to test whether associative learning (Evaluative Conditioning, EC) could strengthen the association between food-types (minimally-processed and heavily-processed foods) and concepts (e.g., healthiness), and whether these changes would be reflected at the implicit associations, at the explicit ratings and in behavioral choices. A semantic congruency task with Electroencephalography recordings was used to examine the neural signature of newly acquired food. The accuracy after EC towards minimally-processed food (MP-food) in the SC task significantly increased, indicating strengthened associations between MP-food and the concept of healthiness through EC.

LABELING AND CATEGORIZATION: EVIDENCE FOR A MERE LABELING EFFECT, ITS MODULATING FACTORS, AND CHARACTERISTICSThis research investigates how category labels influence the perception of within and between-cat... more This research investigates how category labels influence the perception of within and between-category differences. The basic paradigm consists of two phases: first, participants are presented with objective information about members of a group distributed along a familiar continuum and asked to express simple judgments (i.e., similarity between pair of members and absolute estimates). In the second phase, the continuum is manipulated across participants and associated with labels that describe different sections of the distribution without changing the objective information. Participants are asked to again express their judgments in the presence of labels. In Experiment 1, the presence/absence of category boundaries and labels were experimentally manipulated, as was the source of the labels (student-peers or the participant him/herself). Regardless of their source, labels increased within-category similarity (assimilation), but did not consistently reduce across-category similarity (contrast). In Experiment 2, the source of labels (peers vs. experts) and the extremity or "strength" of labels (emotionally strong vs. weak labels) were independently manipulated and showed consistently only assimilation effects. Experiment 3 tested the independent effect of the strength and consequences of labels and replicated the results from Experiments 1 and 2 (i.e., assimilation) and showed that label extremity (i.e., “strength”) independently influences perception. Experiment 4 investigated the perseverance of the labeling effects. The basic paradigm was modified, adding a third phase in which participants were presented again with the original continuum after the labels are no longer present and their validity has been challenged. The effect of the labels persists even in their absence. Across four experiments and two different types of judgments, labels consistently produced assimilation. The simple and mere labeling process appears to have an effect independent of the source and consequences of the labels. Strength of the labels is the only consistent moderating factor, with stronger labels producing greater bias. These findings are remarkably potent since the continuum is familiar, the stimuli clear and present while judging, and the judgments are simple and familiar.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

A possible role of reward sensitivity and impulsivity in weight gain after deep brain stimulation.by Francesco  Foroni and Giulio PergolaA possible role of reward sensitivity and impulsivity in weight gain after deep brain stimulation... more A possible role of reward sensitivity and impulsivity in weight gain after deep brain stimulation. Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS) is safe procedure to treat Parkinson's disease (PD) that however may expose patients to non-motor effects [1]. In particular it has been shown that after the implant patients suddenly increase in weight. However, the exact mechanism of this weight gain has not yet been identified [2,3]. Since these changes seem to be modulated by STN-DBS [4-6], we aimed at evaluating the role of reward sensitivity and impulsivity in weight gain after DBS. Patients with PD scheduled for STN-DBS were recruited. They were tested in a satiated state before surgery in on medication, and after surgery in on medication/off stimulation and on medication/on stimulation. All participants were asked to complete a self-report questionnaire about impulsiveness, a go-no-go experiment measuring the response inhibition to food items and finally, a task that evaluates hedonic and motivational aspects of food processing (liking and wanting, respectively). The preoperative and postoperative body weights were recorded. The mean body weight of patients increased postoperatively. Both reward sensitivity and impulsivity increased after surgery. The weight changes correlated positively with hedonic ratings of food items and salience/motivation towards foods in on medication/on stimulation, in particular for non-sweet foods (both high and low calorie foods). Moreover, weight changes correlated positively with false alarms for food items in the go no-go task in on medication/on stimulation. Finally, weight changes correlated negatively with motor impulsiveness in the pre surgical condition and positively with changes in motor impulsiveness after surgery. Our results confirm that STN-DBS expose patients to the risk of weight gain. Moreover, they suggest that postoperative weight gain may be related to changes in food reward sensitivity and in inhibitory control. Both these aspects have been recognized to play an important role in eating behaviors.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
