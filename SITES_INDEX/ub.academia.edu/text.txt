Puede plantearse, por consiguiente, que existen patrones (o estilos) de construcción empática característicos y particulares para cada tipo de interacción. En el presente estudio, examinamos las estrategias empáticas desplegadas en dos grupos de apoyo en línea: un foro de recuperación de un trastorno de la conducta alimentaria (TCA) y otro dedicado a la gestión y manejo de la diabetes. La muestra extraída del foro de TCA contiene 40 hilos, con un total 82.562 palabras. Para el foro de diabetes, se han seleccionado 18 hilos con un total de 40.932 palabras. Los resultados indican que en el foro de TCA abundan las muestras de empatía primaria y las correspondientes a la adopción de la perspectiva del otro (empatía cognitiva), mientras que en el foro de diabetes la estrategia más recurrente es compartir las propias prácticas de gestión de la enfermedad como prueba de afiliación con el interlocutor. Este contraste en el tipo de movimientos empáticos empleados en una y otra comunidad se pone en relación con la distinta experiencia de la diabetes y los TCA.Palabras clave: empatía, diabetes, trastornos de la conducta alimentaria, foros en línea, movimientos empáticos, estrategias discursivasSave to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

However, differences regarding the experience of the illness might escalate into social conflict. The aim of this study is to explore acts of conflict resolution in an online Spanish mental health forum for recovery from an ED. Focusing on a specific long dispute between one regular member and several other insiders, I perform a micro-analysis of the discursive strategies deployed by those who act as informal mediators to mitigate negative emotions, to rephrase participants’ perspectives and to promote relational empathy. The goal of mediation in the forum is to reinstate the social order of recovery practices and discourses.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The concept is so mainstream that it is often used without critical consideration of its impact, and the role this plays in eating disorder discourse. In this position paper we explore and discuss our positions on the use of control-related terminology for EDs, and interrogate the concept of 'control'. The authors include academic researchers, individuals with lived experience and clinicians. We identify 3 key areas for future improvement for clinicians and researchers, wider society, and policy makers: 1. Critical awareness of language, 2. Avoidance of oversimplification, and 3. Implementing responsible reporting guidelines. In sharing our experiences and observations, we discuss numerous impacts of control framing on ED perceptions, treatment, recovery and lived experience. This paper challenges the mainstream discourse.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The analysis revealed that the discursive construction of expertise concerning both conditions differs in relation to the weight and the nature of the personal experience claimed by the peer expert. The linguistic material deployed in each forum to index inclusion and shared understanding concerns the use of person reference, the use of cognitive verbs, as well as certain strategies that might question the experiences and shared understandings negotiated by members of both patient communities.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Storytelling and Advice: Constructing the Lived Experience of Eating Disorders OnlineStudia Linguistica Universitatis Iagellonicae Cracoviensis Linguistica,  2023Online peer support groups encourage individuals to tell their stories and to find validation and... more Online peer support groups encourage individuals to tell their stories and to find validation and emotional comfort when reading about others’. Coincidently, lived experiences are the kind of knowledge applied to solicit and to deliver peer advice. The aim of the present chapter is to delve into the relationship between storytelling and advice in online mental health communities. The corpus for this research comprised 80 threads (91,484 words), posted between March and August of 2021, from an English speaking online forum that provides support for people with an eating disorder (ED). I performed a qualitative study combining the digital conversational analysis (CA) approach with the framework of small stories research. The results revealed an array of different types of narratives in the data, from more elaborate testimonials of the ED and the process of recovery to brief personal passages responding to the first poster’s request. Thus, whereas the Labovian narrative structure could be identified in first stories, two main configurations, contingent on the kind of response offered, emerged in second stories: parallel assessments (or snapshots) and success stories. Parallel assessments constituted self-centered stories and did not include any advice provision. Success stories, instead, became an essential component of the advice-giving act since they were remedial. The solution proposed by responders to the problem posed by the first poster was organized either to offer tips (that is, a series of practical recommendations to address a specific ED or recovery issue) or to deliver thoughtful advice through a resolutive story that introduced the state of being recovered as a real possibility.  Both parallel assessments and resolutive stories showed contrasting resonances in relation to the first story. Resolutive stories contained resonating elements whose meanings were transformed and resignified from the positioning of a subject moving along in recovery. To the contrary, snapshots echoed specific key expressions from the initiating post. The goal was to display alignment with the first teller by describing a similar I-perspective experience. Taken together, the individual small stories contributed to the co-construction of a multiple-lived story of the ED in the online community.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The focus of the present contribution is how empathy is conversationally managed in two mental health online communities: a chat room and a forum for recovery from an eating disorder (ED). The analysis revealed that in the ED chat room participants resorted to primal responses, formulations of understanding, and parallel assessments to claim understanding and display emotional empathy when responding to a troubles-telling. In contrast, ED forum members tended to produce complex discursive operations to persuade recipients to modify their ED thoughts, feelings and behaviors. This goal called for cognitive empathy displays, such as echoic formulations and resolutive second stories, by which the empathizer echoed the other person's mental representations and offered alternative epistemic and emotional stances.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Mitigation is understood as a psychological category to cope with one or more stressors in communication. The mitigating apparatus is instantiated in discourse with the goal of managing interactants' vulnerabilities. This conceptual framework is applied to examine the mitigation strategies devised by participants in an online mental health forum dedicated to recovery from an eating disorder. The analysis reveals that participants in the site resort to different mitigation patterns to perform the acts of advice solicitation and advice provision. Advice seekers use mitigation devices and discursive moves to tune the illocutionary force of their requests to the audience, to modulate their self-presentation agenda to the forum normative requirements (facework) and to cope with the stressor of the illness. Advice providers, in contrast, produce a comprehensive body of mitigating strategies related to the notions of empathy and perspective-taking, two cognitive constructs that are negotiated, represented and managed interactionally. Mitigation, therefore, constitutes an instrumental and motivational category that shapes the ways of dealing with multiple stressors and multidimensional vulnerabilities in discourse.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
