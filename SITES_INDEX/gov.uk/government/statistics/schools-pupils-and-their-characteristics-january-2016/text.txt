This version corrects the figure on page 13 in section 7 of the main text which previously stated that there ‘are now 1.22 million pupils with special educational needs in state-funded schools in England’. The figure was incorrectly rounded to 1.22 million and now reads 1.23 million. It also relates to all schools, including independent schools, and so no longer refers to ‘state-funded’ schools only in this sentence.
