This new association will facilitate greater understanding and improved management of invasive alien species (IAS) and biological invasions globally, by developing a sustainable network of networks for effective knowledge exchange. In addition to their inclusion in the CBD Strategic Plan for Biodiversity, the increasing ecological, social, cultural and economic impacts associated with IAS have driven the development of multiple legal instruments and policies. This increases the need for greater coordination , cooperation , and information exchange among scientists, management, the community of practice and the public. INVASIVESNET will be formed by linking new and existing networks of interested stakeholders including international and national expert working groups and initiatives, individual scientists, database managers, thematic open access journals, environmental agencies, practitioners, managers, industry, non-government organisations, citizens and educational bodies. The association will develop technical tools and cyberinfrastructure for the collection, management and dissemination of data and information on IAS; create an effective communication platform for global stakeholders; and promote coordination and collaboration through international meetings, workshops, education, training and outreach. To date, the sustainability of many strategic national and international initiatives on IAS have unfortunately been hampered by time-limited grants or funding cycles. Recognising that IAS initiatives need to be globally coordinated and ongoing , we aim to develop a sustainable knowledge sharing association to connect the outputs of IAS research and to inform the consequential management and societal challenges arising from IAS introductions. INVASIVESNET will provide a dynamic and enduring network of networks to ensure the continuity of connections among the IAS community of practice, science and management.Save to LibraryDownloadby David Bruce  Conn•  22  Exotic Species, Invasive species ecology, Invasive Species, Biological invasionsRisk Assessment of Aquatic Invasive Species Introductions via European Inland WaterwaysIntroduction European inland waterways have provid-ed opportunities for the spread of inva-sive alien aquatic (IAS) species for many centuries.

Despite this, there have so far not been any reported cases of their establishment elsewhere in the world. Here, we document the ocellate river stingray, Potamotrygon motoro, as having established itself in Singapore. This represents the first alien record of a South American freshwater stingray outside the Neotropics.Save to LibraryDownloadby Heok Hui Tan•  4  Biological invasions, Biological Sciences, Environmental Sciences, Aquatic Invasive SpeciesEradication of colonizing populations of zebra mussels ( Dreissena polymorpha ) by early detection and SCUBA removal: Lake George, NYSave to LibraryDownloadby Marc E Frischer and +1Joseph Zarzynski•  17  Invasive Species, Biological Sciences, Environmental Sciences, Population SizeAquatic Invasive Species Transport via Trailered Boats: What is Being Moved, Who is Moving it, and What Can Be DoneSave to LibraryDownloadby William Chadderton•  3  Fisheries, Fisheries Sciences, Aquatic Invasive SpeciesAquatic Invasive Species Transport via Trailered Boats: What Is Being Moved, Who Is Moving It, and What Can Be DoneSave to LibraryDownloadby John Rothlisberger•  3  Fisheries, Fisheries Sciences, Aquatic Invasive SpeciesLa diatomea Didymosphenia geminata (Lyngbye) Schmidt nel F.Po e nel T.Varaita.

These constraints comprise intensive navigation and habitat modification by hydraulic engineering. Improving water quality while these constraints remain in place has led to increased colonization by aquatic invasive species. This tendency has been accelerated by the construction of canals connecting river basins.

Our study applies the Drivers-Pressures-State-Impacts-Responses model (DPSIR) to identify social-ecological linkages in the spread of pathogens and AIS by anglers, boaters, and bait dealers in the Great Lakes. We developed a conceptual DPSIR model based on input by staff members in governmental agencies and non-governmental organizations that have been involved in the management of pathogens and AIS. The integration of managers&#39; input to develop the model is a novel approach for understanding fisheries. Most previous studies using the DPSIR framework did not account for natural resource man-agers&#39; input even though the DPSIR framework is frequently applied to provide information to these groups.
