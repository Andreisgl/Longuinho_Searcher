This expression commonly denotes mental medicine that draws from psychotherapeutic practices and psychological theories to improve our understanding of mental diseases and to cure them. Although still used today, usually in juxtaposition to 19th century alienism or to biological psychiatry, the origin and meaning of this expression are unclear. An unpublished lecture (1956) by Ellenberger on this subject, accompanied by an explanatory introduction, is reproduced here to shed light on Ellenberger's interpretation of that term. This article additionally aims to draw certain parallels and distinctions between Ellenberger, Michel Foucault and George Devereux's teaching in the 1950s. Considering that the history of psychiatry is now a well-established speciality in the academic world, Ellenberger's lecture is also an original document which enables us to trace the professionalization of psychiatric historiography as an academic discipline back to its beginnings after World War II.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersJournal of the History of the Behavioral SciencesA quarter century of the history of psychiatry1999 • Andrew ScullDownload Free PDFView PDFHistory and Philosophy of Psychiatry1995 • Aaron Mishara, Michael A SchwartzPhilosophical approaches to psychiatry have their own history, and historical approaches have their own philosophical assumptions. History and philosophy are often in a complementary relationship, a theme suggested by this year's reviews. Historical investigations of the assumptions of the discipline can raise questions of ethics, knowledge and truth, while the questioning of the philosophical assumptions of a discipline points to their historical nature, without necessarily resulting in historical relativism.Download Free PDFView PDFGerman-French Dialogue in the Building of Classical Psychiatry, Berlin 2017 World Congress, Symposium Section History of Psychiatry, World Psychiatric AssociationGerman-French Dialogue in the Building of Classical Psychiatry, Berlin 2017 World Congress, Symposium Section History of Psychiatry, World Psychiatric Association2017 • Jeremie Sinzelle, Patrice CharbitAuthors: SINZELLE J, SUCH G, CRAUS Y, CHARBIT P, PETERS UH, BERRIOS GE.

INTRODUCTION Professor German E. Berrios (United Kingdom) (1) (2) (1) Section Chair, History of Psychiatry, WPA. (2) Emeritus Chair of the Epistemology of Psychiatry, Life-Fellow Robinson College, University of Cambridge, UK During the 19th century the construction of Psychiatry (a term of German origin) was due to an interesting combination of French and German views. This dovetailing was made possible by the cultural ferment going on in Europe at the time. Often presented as synonyms, concepts such as discordance, dissociation, Spaltung, splitting, etc. had different conceptual provenance and each Psychiatric culture used differently to explain dissimilar phenomena. For example, there were horizontal and vertical dissociations, functional and structural forms of splitting, etc. etc. This explains their different explanatory functionality as in the case of Freud’s ego theories or Bleuler’s Schizophrenia. The concept of Schizophrenia itself was a major conceptual departure from the Kraepelinian concept of Dementia praecox whose roots can be traced back to both Morel and Pick. The concept of paranoia also underwent conceptual transformation in both German and French psychiatry and the resulting definitional dissimilarities became unresolvable by the 1920s. In the event the concept was replaced by the inane diagnosis of delusional disorder. The four speakers are young French clinicians who carefully studied French and German psychiatry by reading the ancient sources in the original texts. FOREWORD Pr Dr Uwe Henrik Peters, MD, PhD, hc (Germany) (1) (2) (1) Emeritus Chair, Klinik für Psychiatrie, Psychotherapie. Medical College. Universität zu Köln. Germany. (2) Former President. DGPPN, Deutsche Gesellschaft für Psychiatrie und Psychotherapie, Psychosomatik und Nervenheilkunde. Sektion Geschichte der Psychiatrie. This symposium is about classical psychopathology, what means about the pathology of psyche. French as well as German psychiatrists in the past had built up a doctrine how to observe illness signs and structures in a given patient, how to interpret the observations, how to give names to it and how to use it for diagnosing. In our times, when psychiatric brain researchers try to find technical, chemical and physical, possibilities for diagnosing and treating illnesses of the psyche, psychopathology seems to be unnecessary. However for philosophical reasons it is even impossible to reach such a goal of a technological psychiatry, as Thomas Fuchs in Heidelberg has evidenced. In this situation it is necessary to return to classical psychiatry and psychopathology. History in general and history of psychiatry does not repeat itself. Therefore Psychopathology in the future will have to incorporate histories, history of an illness, life history of the person, history of the time and history of the past. Neither American nor British psychiatry own the premises, the preconditions for working out the future psychopathology, but French and German psychiatries do. Since DSM III-V and ICD-10 or -11 in this respect are completely unsatisfying, it will be necessary to build up a new continental European system of mental disturbances. For this it is a good Aristotelian manner of human sciences to in the first step recapitulate the classical past. The papers of this symposium deal exactly with that. The only but important problem, which I see, concerns language. As Harald Weinrich, the only German Professor with chair at the Collège de France, has pointed out, the French-German friendship is a friendship without language. In spite of the fact that this symposium has to be in globalesic English language, it will demonstrate at the same time a new beginning, away from monolingualism but towards plurilingualism.Download Free PDFView PDFHenderson and Meyer in correspondence: a transatlantic history of dynamic psychiatry, 1908-29Hazel MorrisonCharting a transatlantic movement of so-called 'dynamic psychiatry' during the early twentieth century, this paper reads against the grain of established historiographies. Comparing biographical and autobiographical sources with contemporary correspondence, a history is told which considers the evolution of psychiatric knowledge and clinical practices 'from below'. Revealing a period and place when a 'dynamic' counter-culture challenged the established materialist views of Scottish psychiatry, the longevity of this challenge is considered in the concluding paragraphs.Download Free PDFView PDFPsychosomaticsThe Emergence of Medical Psychiatry1988 • Barry FogelDownload Free PDFView PDFAn Intellectual History of Psychiatry.docxstanley wilkinThis paper is the last one in this short project, an addition to An Unusual Power, and looks at how psychiatrists developed their views, seeing their clients/patients as objects, relying on poor science, driven, I suggest by ideology not evidence based analysis. This paper describes the evolution of different strains of psychiatry-Proprietor, Asylum, Dynamic, and Biological, or as I have identified it, Laboratory. It will describe a professional group, often from the same demographic, driven by a search for status, defining itself through dogma and power, and expressing limited insight into the human condition. I will, apart from looking at and analysing the historical evidence, employ personal anecdotes, using client witness to treatments, and attempt to understand the significance of psychiatric case-studies, what they say about the profession, considering also an economic understanding of medicine and medical care. In the process, I will look at child prostitution in Victorian London, asylums in the UK and America, Freud, principal Victorian psychiatrists, Proprietor, Asylum, Dynamic and Biological-Laboratory Psychiatry and the economics related to psychiatric ideas and practices. This paper holds that the history of Asylum Psychiatry, the now dominant form, was and remains a search for legitimacy, not the history of a science.Download Free PDFView PDFReadings in the History of Psychiatry2013 • Anthony LarmeThe profession of psychiatry is, has always been, and will likely continue to be a much enjoyed subject among filmmakers and their audiences, as it tends to provide exciting and emotionally compelling opportunities to portray personal struggles feared by most of humanity. Following a literature based overview of pre-1985 portrayals of psychiatry in film, this paper fills a notable contemporary literature gap by detailing ten prominent trends in the portrayal of psychiatry in recent film- from increased creativity in storylines to the reflection of new psychiatric theories- and drawing some conclusions regarding the historical and other forms of accuracy of these increasingly more critically and commercially acclaimed portrayals. It shows that film is still primarily a creative and entertainment rather than a totally serious educational medium and, as such, accuracy of any degree is usually subordinated to the interests of simply ensuring that the audience has a good time and / or re...Download Free PDFView PDFHistory of PsychologyINTRODUCTION Psychology and Psychiatry in the Global World: Historical Perspectives2019 • Harry Yi-Jui WuDownload Free PDFView PDFHistory of PsychiatryBook Review: Edward Shorter.

The 'critical epistemology' of Georges Lantéri-Laura, History of Psychiatry, 28, 2 (2017), pp. 182-194Elisabetta BassoThis paper analyses the historical and epistemological work of the French psychiatrist Georges Lantéri-Laura (1930–2004) within the context of the French 'tradition' of history and philosophy of sciences, with special reference to Georges Canguilhem and Michel Foucault. After an introduction devoted to a critical survey of the most recent works on the history and historiography of psychiatry in French, the paper outlines Lantéri-Laura's approach by focusing especially on the role played by the methodological concept of 'semiology' as regards the relation between medicine and psychiatry. The last part of the paper draws attention to the relation between history and philosophy of psychiatry in light of Lantéri-Laura's 'critical epistemology'. http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0957154X17690099Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
