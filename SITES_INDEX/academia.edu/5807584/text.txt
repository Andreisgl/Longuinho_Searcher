This study assessed psychosocial correlates of PA among Nigerian university students. Methods: This cross-sectional study recruited 1600 students of the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile – Ife, Nigeria. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) was used to assess PA at 7-day recall (MET-min/week) while psychosocial variables of Exercise Self-Efficacy (ESE), Perceived Barriers to PA (PBPA) and parental Socio-economic Status (SES) were assessed using ESE, PBPA and SES questionnaires respectively. However, 1399 completed the study yielding a response rate of 87.4%. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Alpha level was at p &lt; 0.05. Results: A majority of the respondents, 89.4% reported sufficient PA. High self-efficacy was twice more likely in male (OR = 2.19, C.I. = 1.16 – 4.12) than female count...Download Free PDFView PDFBMC public healthInvestigating the effect of a 3-month workplace-based pedometer-driven walking programme on health-related quality of life in meat processing workers: a feasibility study within a randomized controlled trial2015 • Suliman MansiIn New Zealand, meat processing populations face many health problems as a result of the nature of work in meat processing industries. The primary aim of this study was to examine the feasibility of using a pedometer-based intervention to increase physical activity and improve health-related outcomes in a population of meat processing workers. A single-blinded randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted. A convenience sample of meat workers (n = 58; mean age 41.0 years; range: 18-65) participated in the trial. Participants were randomly allocated into two groups. Intervention participants (n = 29) utilized a pedometer to self monitor their activity, whilst undertaking a brief intervention, and educational material. Control participants (n = 29) received educational material only. The primary outcomes of ambulatory activity, and health-related quality of life, were evaluated at baseline, immediately following the 12-week intervention and three months post-intervention.

Methods: Overweight women aged 40 or older who self-identified as lesbian, bisexual, or " something else " participated in five pilot interventions of 12 or 16 weeks' duration. These tailored interventions took place at lesbian and bisexual community partner locations and incorporated weekly group meetings, nutrition education, and physical activity. Three sites had non-intervention comparison groups. Standardized questionnaires assessed consumption of fruits and vegetables , sugar-sweetened beverages, alcohol, physical activity, and quality of life. Weight and waist-to-height ratio were obtained through direct measurement or self-report. Analytical Plan: Within-person changes from pre-intervention to post-intervention were measured using paired comparisons. Participant characteristics that influenced the achievement of nine health objectives were analyzed. Achievement of health objectives across three program components (mindfulness approach, gym membership, and pedometer use) was compared with the comparison group using generalized linear models. Results: Of the 266 intervention participants, 95% achieved at least one of the health objectives, with 58% achieving three or more. Participants in the pedometer (n ¼ 43) and mindfulness (n ¼ 160) programs were more likely to increase total physical activity minutes (relative risk [RR], 1.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.18–2.36; p ¼ .004; RR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.01– 1.89; p ¼ .042, respectively) and those in the gym program (n ¼ 63) were more likely to decrease their waist-to-height ratio (RR, 1.89; 95% CI, 0.97–3.68, p ¼ .06) compared with the comparison group (n ¼ 67). Conclusion: This effective multisite intervention improved several healthy behaviors in lesbian and bisexual women and showed that tailored approaches can work for this population.Download Free PDFView PDFCancersEffect of Exercise Training on Quality of Life after Colorectal and Lung Cancer Surgery: A Meta-AnalysisBárbara OliveirosSurgical treatment affects health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and increases fatigue symptoms in patients with lung cancer (LC) and colorectal cancer (CRC). We aimed to systematically review the effect of exercise training on HRQoL and fatigue after LC and CRC surgery. Randomized controlled trials published before 21 March 2021, were searched in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, SPORTDiscus and PEDro. Eligible trials compared the effect of exercise interventions initiated preoperatively or in the first 3 months after surgery versus usual care on postoperative HRQoL and fatigue. Standardized mean differences (SMD) were pooled using random-effects models. Twelve studies with a total of 777 patients were included. In LC patients (10 studies, n = 651), exercise training in general led to a moderate improvement in the physical domain of HRQoL (0.68: 95% CI: [0.47; 0.89]) and a small reduction in fatigue levels after surgery (SMD = 0.28: 95% CI: [0.02; 0.53]), while no effects were found...Download Free PDFView PDFWalking in the high-rise city: a HEPA program2014 • Dove Medical PressAbstract: Due to the lack of good infrastructure in the public estates, many older adults in urban areas are sedentary.
