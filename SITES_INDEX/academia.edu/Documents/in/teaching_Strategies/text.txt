Funded in part by the Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program of the National Science Foundation (NSF), these projects have prepared middle and high school teachers, college faculty and career counselors from more than 100 New England institutions to introduce fiber optics, telecommunications and photonics technology education. Four of these projects will be discussed here: (1) The New England Board of Higher Education's (NEBHE) Fiber Optics Technology Education Project, (FOTEP) was designed to teach fiber optics theory and to provide laboratory experiences at the secondary and postsecondary levels. (2) Springfield Technical Community College's Northeast Center for Telecommunications Technologies (NCTT) is developing curricula and instructional materials in lightwave, networking and wireless telecommunications technologies. (3) The Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics project ComTech developed a 12-week, hands-on curriculum and teaching strategies for middle and high school science and technology teachers in telecommunications and focused on optical communication (fiber optics). (4) NEBHE's project PHOTON is preparing middle, secondary and postsecondary instructors to introduce theory and laboratory experiences in photonics, including geometric and wave optics as well as principles of lasers and photonics applications.Save to LibraryDownloadby Nicholas Massa•  18  Optics, Curriculum Design, Fiber Optics, TelecommunicationsTHE INTERSECTION BETWEEN VOCAL MUSIC AND LANGUAGE ARTS INSTRUCTION: A REVIEW OF THE LITERATUREThis paper discusses the interaction of vocal music skill development with phonemic awareness (the ability to hear and manipulate phonemes, the smallest units of language) and fluency training in kindergarten and grade one language arts... moreThis paper discusses the interaction of vocal music skill development with phonemic awareness (the abilityto hear and manipulate phonemes, the smallest units of language) and fluency training in kindergarten andgrade one language arts instruction. The phonemic awareness and fluency activities provided in languagearts curricula are often music related: songs, chants and rhymes. Research is discussed regarding auditoryprocessing related to vocal production; developmentally appropriate singing, prosody (the intentionalgrouping of words into phrases), and music perception as it relates to reading achievement. Thepedagogical strategies necessary for developmentally appropriate modeling in both music and language artsinstruction are discussed.Save to LibraryDownloadby Patricia O'Herron•  10  Music Education, Languages and Linguistics, Natural Language Processing, Teacher EducationMaintaining connections: An investigation of the factors that influence student participation in health science classesSave to LibraryDownloadby Sharron King•  6  Learning Community, Health Science, teaching Strategies, Path AnalysisChanging teaching techniques and adapting new technologies to improve student learning in an introductory meteorology and climate courseSave to LibraryDownloadby David Rudge•  10  Earth Sciences, Science Education, Inquiry Based Learning, New TechnologyTeachers' goals regarding social competenceSave to LibraryDownloadby Monique Volman•  3  Secondary Education, Social Competence, teaching StrategiesFostering evidence-based care in clinical teachingSave to LibraryDownloadby Debra Erickson-Owens•  14  Nursing, Evidence Based Medicine, Health Care, Midwifery(with Judy Ling, Aaron Paul and Suhaimi Afandi) All About History, Unit 2.

Multimedia projectors have become one of the teaching tools the teacher cannot bear without it. The concept of making this tool to be interactive and easier to use was far conceived by the researcher. The researcher's objective was to develop such tool and evaluate it according to its portability, simplicity, robustness, user-friendliness, effectiveness and efficiency. The respondents of the project were both the students and teachers of Batangas State University ARASOF-Nasugbu. The researcher has developed different prototypes for the interactive pen and tested in different environment and demonstrated the "know-how" of the project. The project was built using a simple infrared light emitting diode (IR LED), infrared tracker, and software which computes, detects and interact with the application program. Evaluation of the project followed the demonstration. The project got a high acceptance according to its portability, simplicity, robustness, user-friendliness, effectiveness and efficiency. The researcher is recommending the full implementation of the project in the Batangas State University ARASOF-Nasugbu and for better enhancement of the project by eliminating the pen.Save to LibraryDownloadby Research and Statistics Center•  5  Classroom, teaching Strategies, Interactive, PENDesarrollo de la competencia lectora en secundariaSave to LibraryDownloadby Juan Carlos Silas Casillas•  8  Reading Comprehension, Comprensión de lectura, teaching Strategies, Estrategias Para La Enseñanza Y Aprendizaje De Valores HumanosMozart in Us: How the Brain processes MusicSave to LibraryDownloadby Wilfried Gruhn•  7  Brain Imaging, Music Perception, Neuronal Network, teaching StrategiesDiscrepant Events: A Challenge to Students' IntuitionSave to LibraryDownloadby Wilson Gonzalez-Espada•  17  Science Education, Conceptual change, Physics Education, Higher Order ThinkingEffective Teaching Strategies and Methods of Delivery for Patient Education: A Systematic Review and Practice Guideline RecommendationsSave to LibraryDownloadby Roxanne Cosby and +1Susan  Boyko•  10  Communication, Cancer, Teaching, Patient educationThe effect of computer-assisted learning versus conventional teaching methods on the acquisition and retention of handwashing theory and skills in pre-qualification nursing students: a randomised controlled trialSave to LibraryDownloadby Alison While•  28  Program Evaluation, Nursing, Nonparametric Statistics, Educational MeasurementNurse Educator's Affective Teaching StrategiesTeaching is highly charged with feeling, aroused by and directed towards not just people, but also values and ideals (Garritz, 2010).

Emotions and feelings greatly affect the way the students learn and acquire knowledge. There must be a balance between the three domains of learning because once one domain is left behind, the other domains will be affected. The purpose of this study is to determine nurse educators' affective teaching strategies. Specifically, it assessed the strategies of nurse educators on how to develop the affective domain of student nurses. In addition, the study assessed the values of student nurses in terms of God-centeredness, Leadership, Integrity, and Nationalism. Lastly, the researchers proposed innovative teaching methodologies to enhance the attitudes of nursing students. This study used descriptive research design. The respondents of the study were the nursing students and clinical instructors of Lyceum of the Philippines University-Batangas. 190 student nurses were chosen through stratified random sampling while 10 clinical instructors were chosen based on the number of times they handled the students both in lecture and clinical area. The instruments were self-made and standardized questionnaire and interview guide to obtain the data needed for the study. The data gathered are compiled, organized and tabulated for statistical treatment. Weighted mean was utilized to compute the quantitative data whereas the interview was used to form the qualitative analysis. Role modelling is the most common strategy of nurse educators to enhance the affective domain of student nurses. Their actions consciously and unconsciously affecting the attitude of the students. Hence, confidence among the students needs most attention in developing affective domain as it produce change in other values presented in the study. The proposed teaching strategies aim to enhance the affective domain of nursing students in line with the institutional core values.Save to LibraryDownloadby Research and Statistics Center•  3  teaching Strategies, Affective Domain, Nurse EducatorsDon't do this-Pitfalls in using anti-patterns in teaching human-computer interaction principlesSave to LibraryDownloadby Paula  Kotze•  16  Computer Science, Software Engineering, Human Computer Interaction, Software DevelopmentONE PROFESSOR'S FACE-TO-FACE TEA CHING STRA TEGIES WHILE BECOMING AN ONLINE INSTRUCTORSave to LibraryDownloadby Trey  Martindale•  10  Higher Education, Case Studies, Computer Mediated Communication, Face to FaceRotation in secondary school: teaching the effects of frictional forceSave to LibraryDownloadby Adriano Sampaio•  6  Physics Education, Problem Solving, teaching Strategies, Meaningful LearningNurse Educator's Affective Teaching StrategiesTeaching is highly charged with feeling, aroused by and directed towards not just people, but also values and ideals (Garritz, 2010).

The study employed a survey research design. The total sample size for the study was two hundred and twenty-five (225) respondents. Data was analyzed and presented using mean statistic and standard deviation. Hypothesis for the study was analyzed using t-test with a p≤0.05 level of significance. Students in the study to a low extent (=1.97) agreed that vodcast and podcast increase productivity, promote creativity and facilitate academic learning. Respondents are of the view that the University of Nigeria, Nsukka postgraduate program is not yet advanced enough to use vodcast and podcast technologies for teaching students (=2.88). Unavailability of technologies had a significant influence on barriers that hinder students from using vodcast and podcast. Based on the findings and conclusion, it is recommended among others, that the University of Nigeria, Nsukka organize a capacity building workshop hinged on the use of top-notch technology for 21st century education; that departments in the university should motivate lecturers to employ technological tools in teaching through incentives as these will encourage every lecturer to key into the move.Save to LibraryDownloadby Patrick S .

This lack of clarity stems in part from the fact that there are four distinctly different reasons for using sources, and each carries its own implications for classroom practice. These purposes are 1) illustration and motivation; 2) evidence for historical inquiry; 3) visual or textual interpretation; 4) source analysis. By reflecting on how each of these purposes can play a role in the classroom, which kinds of sources are appropriate for each, and where they fit into an overall sequence of instruction, teachers can ensure that their use of sources deepens and extends students’ historical understanding.Save to LibraryDownloadby Keith Barton•  7  Social Studies Education, History Education, Teaching History, History TeachingTeaching during clinical practice: strategies and techniques used by preceptors in nursing educationSave to LibraryDownloadby Elisabeth Carlson•  17  Nursing, Focus Groups, Cultural Anthropology, TeachingOnline Teaching Experience: A Qualitative Metasynthesis (QMS)Qualitative studies of educators who teach online are crucial to provide direction for practice and research as they offer an emic perspective.

Dada su gran variedad, el objetivo delestudio es identificar qué estrategias metodológicas se usan con los alumnos con TEA en el aula regular, y si difieren de las usadas enel aula SIEI. Se desarrolló un estudio cualitativo y descriptivo a partir de la observación en las aulas y entrevistas con una muestrade dos escuelas de educación primaria. Los resultados muestran que ambas escuelas utilizan múltiples estrategias, aunque algunasno se contemplan, por ejemplo, la generalización. Además, cuando hay un aula SIEI, se tiende a situar al alumno con TEA fuera delaula regular, donde el maestro de apoyo mantiene el rol de tutor. En cambio, dentro del aula regular, el maestro de apoyo destinasu tiempo al alumno con TEA de bajo funcionamiento; mientras que los alumnos con TEA de alto funcionamiento reciben apoyopor parte de los iguales.

The six phases of the project included study acquisition, study coding, determination of intercoder objectivity, establishing criteria for inclusion of studies, computation of effect sizes for statistical analysis, and conducting the analyses. Studies were required to have been carried out in the United States, been experimental or quasi-experimental, and must have included effect size or the statistics necessary to calculate effect size. Sixty-one studies met the criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis. The following eight categories of teaching strategies were revealed during analysis of the studies (effect sizes in parentheses): Questioning Strategies (0.74); Manipulation Strategies (0.57); Enhanced Material Strategies (0.29); Assessment Strategies (0.51); Inquiry Strategies (0.65); Enhanced Context Strategies (1.48); Instructional Technology (IT) Strategies (0.48); and Collaborative Learning Strategies (0.95). All these effect sizes were judged to be significant. Regression analysis revealed that internal validity was influenced by Publication Type, Type of Study, and Test Type. External validity was not influenced by Publication Year, Grade Level, Test Content, or Treatment Categories. The major implication of this research is that we have generated empirical evidence supporting the effectiveness of alternative teaching strategies in science. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In many language teaching situations, much of the materials fail to meet the instructors' expectations, and the materials are criticized for their isolation, irrelevance on taking into account of personal and local contexts and inadequate coverage of the essential aspects of language learning/teaching. Moreover, the existing materials are almost all developed and flourish in the western context, which pose some difficulties both for the teachers and for the learners to bridge them into various local contexts. This paper explores some of the strategies for ESL/EFL teachers that they might incorporate to enhance the use of textbooks in the classroom. For this, we examine some of the popular textbooks that are commonly used by different English Language teachers at the tertiary level and we pilot some of the strategies in the classrooms in a controlled situation to observe the outcome of the implementation of these strategies. It is found that in almost all cases learner-centred work with a course book and extension of text-based tasks with real life experience have produced positive results .Save to LibraryDownloadby Mohammad Moniruzzaman Akhand and +1Md Kamrul Hasan•  3  teaching Strategies, Task-based language teaching, University Teaching in focus: A learner-centredStudents' conceptual knowledge of mechanical waves across different backgrounds and culturesSave to LibraryDownloadby Apisit Tongchai and +1Manjula Sharma•  10  Physics Education, High School, Research Paper, teaching StrategiesA comparison of early childhood and elementary education students' beliefs about primary classroom teaching practicesSave to LibraryDownloadby Dominic Gullo•  16  Psychology, Early Childhood Education, Beliefs, Early ChildhoodOCTR: A Model of Learning StagesThis paper describes a model of learning stages called OCTR.

A qualitative research design used in-depth interviews and classroom observations with 7 African American women teachers in technical schools and community colleges. The results were that the teachers&#39; positionality affected their experiences by (a) producing a teaching philosophy based on a history of marginalization, (b) raising issues of credibility with students because of the teachers&#39; race and gender, and (c) directly affecting their classroom interactions and teaching strategies.

Correlational analysis was utilized to treat data concerning the teachers’ preferences regarding needs analysis and teaching strategies. An independent sample T-test was used to identify the difference in the teachers’ responses on determining the respondents’ perception about the needs assessment used for Junior and Senior High school students and the relationships between the perceived grammatical skills of English teachers. Findings revealed that the teachers’ grammar needs analysis on speaking skill was classified as the most critical assessment, while the least essential was the viewing skill. English teachers agreed that the usual English grammar challenge is when they expect the teachers to present grammar points explicitly. However, they disagree that they do not find grammatical terminologies useful. Reading was the regularly used teaching approach in grammar, whereas the less-used was the speaking strategy. Moreover, a significant difference occurred between the grammar skills and needs analysis used when grouped according to grade levels. Senior high school teachers had greater assessments on teaching grammar through vocabulary, speaking, and writing. Furthermore, senior high school teachers considered grammar needs on speaking and writing as more important. There was no significant relationship between teaching strategies, and grammar needs to the students’ English grammatical challenges. Therefore, a strategy enhancement program for both the Junior and Senior high school levels has been proposed.Save to LibraryDownloadby Joshua Apolonio•  20  Teaching English as a Second Language, Second Language Acquisition, Languages and Linguistics, Learning and TeachingEvidence-based practice-focused interactive teaching strategy: a controlled studySave to LibraryDownloadby Jaynelle Stichler•  17  Program Evaluation, Nursing, Evidence Based Practice, Evidence Based NursingNarrative Study of Teaching Strategies and Challenges Encountered by Teachers in Synchronous Online ClassesThe COVID-19 pandemic urged a dramatic shift in the educational landscape, whereby digital platforms are utilized in teaching and learning.

This new setup has posed challenges in teaching mathematics; hence, this study was conceptualized to explore the different teaching strategies and challenges math teachers encountered in their synchronous online classes (SOC). It aimed to draw analysis and increased understanding of the experiences related to teaching strategies and challenges, focusing on two essential aspects of teaching and learning: content and student engagement. Online in-depth interviews involving nine (9) Junior High School mathematics teachers of a private academic institution in Southern Luzon were conducted for data gathering. Results depict two significant themes as the participants' strategies in their SOC: teacher-directed instruction and motivational strategies.Meanwhile, three major themes emerged as challenges encountered by the participants: the role of the teacher, time constraints, and students' responsiveness. Findings suggest that some of the difficulties in synchronous online teaching may have resulted from the tendency to replicate face-to-face teaching in a virtual classroom and lack of technological proficiency. Hence, opportunities to enhance teachers" knowledge and skills in digital pedagogies and more studentcentered online teaching approaches can be a gateway to address the challenges posed.Save to LibraryDownloadby International Journal of Social Learning•  6  Instructional Design, Educational Technology, Distance Education, teaching StrategiesTheories-based Inclusive Education PracticesThe article reviews the literature related to the foundations of the theoretical perspective of behaviourism, cognitivism, constructivism, and humanism for supporting inclusive education, and to suggest applications of theories-based... moreThe article reviews the literature related to the foundations of the theoretical perspective of behaviourism, cognitivism, constructivism, and humanism for supporting inclusive education, and to suggest applications of theories-based inclusive education practices. It is a review article which provides a perspective on the theories of behaviourism, cognitivism, constructivism and humanism that are considered to underpin the theory and practice of inclusive education. The article argues that education practices for the inclusion of students with special educational needs can be derived from each of the four theoretical perspectives. By adopting such an eclectic approach to the use of theories-driven inclusive education, this article suggests that inclusive education practices will best serve the needs of all students, including those with special needs.Save to LibraryDownloadby paula  faulkner•  13  Sociology, Teaching and Learning, Education, Special EducationTeaching Experience and ReflectionThe standard of education can be improved if educators actively assess themselves or have someone else evaluate their teaching skills.

However, this study aims to investigate the impact of self-directed learning on learners' reading comprehension proficiency and the measurements that teachers can do to encourage self-direction among adult learners. This is done by introducing self-direction strategies of reading comprehension, to the learners to be able to monitor their own learning. To this end, they ap plied more of the metacognitive strategies that are believed to be at the heart of self-directed activity (Grow, 2010). 92 upper-intermediate and advanced female Iranian EFL learners, studying English in IELTS & TOEFL Center of Arian in Gorgan, Iran, randomly selected and divided into two groups: experimental and control that the same syllabus and assessment procedures followed. The instrument includes an IELTS reading test. Finally, the data gathered by the experiment of the study was analyzed through SPSS software, using Independent Samples t-test.

They may spend much time to make students pay attention and concentrate on managing classroom activities. In Indonesia, many classrooms still go beyond thirty students, and it is common to be more than forty students in a class. As a result, the students are halfhearted and reluctant to participate actively in classroom activities. Promoting interactive activities such as forcing students' engagement in group discussion and presentation seem to be alternative ways to aid students to learn English in a meaningful way and make them communicate effectively in English during teaching and learning process. Thus, the aim of this paper is to highlight some interactive activities for effective learning which can motivate and engage students with learning activities and create their interest in learning English in overcrowded classrooms.Save to LibraryDownloadby Mutiara Ayu•  5  Teaching English as a Second Language, Applied Linguistics, Teaching English As A Foreign Language, teaching StrategiesImpact of Whole Brain Teaching Based Instruction on Academic Performance of Grade 8 Students in Algebra: Compendium of WBT-Based Lesson PlansSave to LibraryDownloadby RAISA SONTILLANO•  20  Teaching and Learning, Education, Teacher Education, Philosophy Of MathematicsAprendizaje Basado en Problemas: Validación de un Instrumento de EvaluaciónSave to LibraryDownloadby Adrián  Martínez González•  4  Interdisciplinary research, Team work, teaching Strategies, Aprendizaje Basado en ProblemasINTERNATIONAL CENTRE FOR SCIENCE, HUMANITIES AND EDUCATION RESEARCH JOURNAL (ICSHERJ)Save to LibraryDownloadby Emmanuel Achor•  5  Science Education, Arts Education, Classroom Practices, teaching StrategiesNextLast »Related TopicsActive TeachingFollowFollowingTeaching Strategies and StylesFollowFollowingEarth and Space science educationFollowFollowingContentFollowFollowingScience Process SkillsFollowFollowingTeaching Thinking SkillsFollowFollowingClassroom ObservationFollowFollowingClassroom ManagementFollowFollowingTeacher EducationFollowFollowingQuality in EducationFollowFollowing 71.6 million researchers use this site every month.
