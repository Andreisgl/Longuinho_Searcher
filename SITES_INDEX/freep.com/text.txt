Gov. Whitmer discloses cost of Florida trip and how it was paid forNews Sports Autos Entertainment Advertise Obituaries eNewspaper Legals Subscribe ELECTIONSGov. Whitmer discloses cost of trip to visit her father and how it was paid for Paul EganDetroit Free PressView Comments LANSING — A nonprofit corporation paid most of the $27,521 cost of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's contentious private plane trip to visit her father, her office said Friday.Whitmer used her personal funds to pay the $855 cost of her seat, according to a report Whitmer's office released. That was calculated as the comparable cost of a first-class ticket, spokeswoman Tiffany Brown told the Free Press.Friday's disclosures followed weeks of criticism of Whitmer for refusing to say when she left the state to visit her father, Richard Whitmer, during the coronavirus pandemic, at a time Michigan residents were being cautioned about travel.The disclosures also follow a Thursday report in the Free Press in which Democratic and Republican communications experts who have worked for public officials were critical of how the governor's office handled the story, saying the lack of transparency extended a one-day story into one that continued for weeks.Whitmer had refused to say how the trip was paid for, except to say that it had not been charged to taxpayers and it was not a gift.The Associated Press had reported that the Gulfstream 280 business jet was registered to Air Eagle, whose agent is John Nicholson, executive vice president of Detroit-based PVS Chemicals, according to state records. The Moroun family, which owns the Ambassador Bridge, said it is a partner in Air Eagle. The Detroit News and Crain's Detroit Business reported that the Cotton family, which sold Meridian Health in 2018, also has a stake."Given the extraordinary and ongoing threats to the life and safety of the governor and her family, we do not generally comment on the governor's personal schedule," Whitmer Chief of Staff JoAnne Huls  said in a memo to Whitmer's team that was first reported by Michigan Information & Research Service Inc. and released to the news media."However, I fully expect Republican party officials will continue to make political attacks against the governor and her family, so I wanted you to have the facts."Whitmer flew out of Lansing on Friday, March 12, and returned on Monday, March 15, Huls said in the memo.More:Public relations experts explain why stories about governor's Florida trip won't go awayMore:Whitmer won't discuss trip after reported use of private jetThe memo did not disclose Whitmer's destination, but Whitmer's office has not denied she flew to Florida, where her father has a home."As some of you know, the governor's father has been battling a severe chronic illness for several years, and the governor has publicly acknowledged that she flew during a time when Michigan had some of the lowest COVID numbers in the region," Huls said."While she was there, she continued to carry out her duties as governor while she assisted her father with household duties like cooking and cleaning." Whitmer was not fully vaccinated at the time of the trip but "throughout the pandemic and during  the trip, the governor has followed COVID-19 protocols," and Michigan has not had any ordered limitations on travel for nearly a year, she said."Due to ongoing security and public health concerns, we made a decision to use a chartered flight for this trip.  The governor's flight was not a gift, not paid for at taxpayer expense and was done in compliance with the law."Huls said the charter flight was paid for by Michigan Transition 2019, doing business as the Executive Office Account, which publicly discloses donors and expenses online at michigantransition.org/sunshine/.Michigan Transition 2019 was incorporated in 2018 under Section 501c4 of the Internal Revenue Code, state records show. Such "social welfare" nonprofit funds are commonly used by state and local officeholders but have been the source of past controversies, notably for former Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick and for former Republican Gov. Rick Snyder, whose NERD (New Energy to Reinvent and Diversify) Fund was the subject of criticism for not disclosing its corporate donors and for paying the salary of a top Snyder aide, Richard Baird.Michigan Transition 2019 was initially set up to pay expenses related to Whitmer's inauguration but has since been used for other officeholder expenses, such as consulting, records show.It was not immediately clear why the cost of the plane and Whitmer's $855 contribution were listed as May expenditures and revenues for the fund, rather than being recorded in March, when the plane was hired."The flight was paid immediately upon receiving receipt of the cost," said Brown, without providing further explanation.A conservative group with close connections to the Republican Party, Michigan Rising Action, said Whitmer should not have used the nonprofit fund to hire a plane for a personal trip, since the fund is related to her officeholder position.Tori Sachs, the group's executive director, said the disclosures demonstrate why Whitmer "tried to hide the trip and cover up who paid." Sachs called for an investigation of whether the transaction meets IRS requirements.Huls said that after Whitmer returned to Michigan, "her father's health deteriorated, and his physicians at the University of Michigan asked him to return home early to be re-evaluated. On Monday of this week, the governor personally took her father to Ann Arbor, where Mr. Whitmer underwent a medical procedure to start intravenous antibiotics. Mr. Whitmer's procedure was successful, and we are hopeful that his condition improves."Huls said Whitmer's office "could have done a better job of answering questions about this trip with more clarity while also balancing the need to protect the governor’s security, and for that I take responsibility."She said Whitmer's office on Friday also posted a copy of the governor's federal tax return, personal financial statement, and travel and time report for 2020 at www.michigan.gov/sunshine ahead of the new tax deadline next week."This is a practice that began when the governor was a candidate, and Gov. Whitmer is the first sitting governor to voluntarily disclose personal financial information online," Huls said. "We are hopeful that the Michigan Legislature will soon pass bipartisan legislation that requires elected officials to share similar financial information with the public."Contact Paul Egan: 517-372-8660 or pegan@freepress.com. Follow him on Twitter @paulegan4.  Read more on Michigan politics and sign up for our elections newsletter. Become a subscriber.View Comments Staff Directory Careers Accessibility Support Site Map Legals Our Ethical Principles Subscription Terms & Conditions Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your California Privacy Rights / Privacy PolicyDo Not Sell / Share / Target My InfoCookie SettingsContact Us Support Local Businesses Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Buy and Sell Licensing & Reprints Help Center Subscriber Guide My Account Give FeedbackSubscribe Today Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook Twitter eNewspaper Storytellers ArchivesJobs Cars Classifieds Education Renvy.com Michigan.com Reviewed 10Best LocaliQ Digital Marketing Solutions© 2023 www.freep.com.
