Subject:
      Government o' the Tongue (Draft Review)      
        Irish histories have typically confined their focus to events in Ireland, often at the expense of their larger Atlantic context, a weakness surely?. 
Irish history books, at least the ones used in many schools in the south of Ireland, have tended to skirt around the uncomfortable fact that Ireland, to mention but two, found itself on the 'wrong' side of the Reformation and on the wrong side of the English Civil War, or the War of the Three Kingdoms as it is now known. 'Wrong' in the sense that predominantly Ireland was neither Protestant nor Puritan.
And while it is understandable that a new country, the Irish Free State of 1921, would prefer not to cast its history in terms of either religion or its opposition to English rule, religion and England have largely defined Irish history since the 16th Century where this wonderful study begins, representing a more comprehensive and a more inclusive approach.   
The more I read this book and attempt to absorb its contents the more I realise that highlighting this or that feature probably only has the effect of weakening the overall impact of a book well able to speak for itself; beautifully written, well argued and, quite apart from the detailed research and the well of information (see the detailed bibliography) the author has at his disposal, even handed in its depiction of events on a landscape that remains to some extent tribal, which is to say factional (...the fish being often the last one to discover water.).
Readers already familiar with Ireland and its history can skip down to the Book Review which follows a summary update on the extent to which Ireland retains its British connection today.
A. Background information. (Acts, Facts, Elections, Etc.).
B. Book Review. 
C. Some observations about Edmund Spenser.
Background
To what extent is Ireland British today? -Well, because a person can be declared a British (or an 'American' or 'Indian' or 'Chinese') citizen without that person necessarily changing their 'religious, linguistic or cultural' sympathies or affiliations (to borrow the author's definition) some background information may help untangle this complex knot so far as it relates to Ireland.
Exactly one hundred years ago, in 1920, the entire island of Ireland was officially British. The Government of Ireland Act in 1920, also known as the Fourth Home Rule Act saw the country divided with six of the northern province of Ulster's counties maintaining the link with Great Britain.
-------The island of Ireland, geographically, is part of the British Isles and the 'Great' in Great Britain refers to the larger island comprising England, Scotland, Wales (as well as a number of smaller islands). Ireland George Bernard Shaw described as 'John Bull's Other Island'.
----The British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act was passed in 1914, defining citizenship and creating official passports. In 1920, the League of Nations held its first conference on passports-----
So, 1921-22 saw the establishment of the Irish Free State when the predominantly Nationalist and Catholic south (representing roughly 3/4 of the island or 26 of 32 counties) ceased to be officially British. 
--------Ireland left the Commonwealth in 1952, having remaining officially neutral in WWII (1939-45). Many Irish soldiers also served in WWI (1914-19). The declaration of the Irish Free State of December 1922 followed the 1914 (3rd) Home Rule Act. Catholic Emancipation (achieved 1829) and Home Rule for Ireland dominated British parliamentary politics for much of the 19th Century.   |  In the wake of the French Revolution (1789) and the American War of Independence (1777-1783) the kingdoms of Ireland and Great Britain were merged in 1800 with the Act of Union------
Fifty six years ago, in 1964, over 63% of voters in the independent (since 1921) state of Northern Ireland declared for Unionist candidates (UUP) who occupied all twelve allocated seats at Westminster. 
In the 1919 election, that figure was just over 32% with Unionist candidates (mainly DUP) holding one seat more than their Nationalist counterparts abstentionist Sinn Fein ('We Ourselves', who refuse to take their seats at Westminster as they refuse to swear an oath of allegiance, just as they wouldn't in Dublin in 1921/22). This change reflects demographic change where there are today more Nationalists than there were previously, though care should be exercised in drawing conclusions. Both Nationalist (-6.7%) and Unionist (-5.4%) candidates lost ground in the 1919 Northern Ireland election as moderate centrist parties (Alliance Party, SDLP, UUP) gained ground. 
------------This suggests that the sectarian gulf is narrowing but as DUP voters might have once support the UUP, it may amount to an insifgnificant lateral shift just as Fianna Fail voters in the South voted Sinn Fein in the 2020 election. see below). 
------That a party (UUP) can gain over 11% of the popular vote but win no seats while 30% of the popular vote can win 10 seats is an anomaly of the voting system and one which clearly needs addressing as that 11% represents 93,000 voters in a province that remains volatile--------
In the 2020 election in southern Ireland, known as the Irish Republic, Nationalist Sinn Fein, long in hibernation in the south, narrowly missed becoming the biggest political party and while many pundits reminded readers about Sinn Fein's role in the armed struggle as the anti-Treaty party, the entire history of the island (and that of Europe) is the story of often violent struggle.
Book Review
When Karl Marx summarily dismissed Edmund Spenser as Queen Elizabeth I's 'arse-kissing poet', he wasn't short-changing Spenser so much as he was the interested Reader. Spenser (like Shakespeare) was so much more than a humble born poet in need of patronage, and this wonderful study explains how he set the agenda. 
When John Pope-Hennessy (...if I recall correctly) likewise likened Spenser's epic poem 'the Faerie Queene' as 'a hymn to purity sung from the depths of a brothel', in effect he too was usurping the need to investigate the poet/administrator's actual role and influence in Ireland. This book does not attempt to rehabilitate Spenser but helps us to understand his influence on policy makers, those who would see Ireland become British. 
------------That a truly great critic like Frank Kermode can write a whole study on Spenser without mentioning Ireland should give the reader a sense of how Spenser needs to be understood not simply as the author of a long epic about Knights doing chivalrous things. The same can be said for Northrop Frye and any number of others. Distinguished as they were, like Spenser they too were a product of their age and training. Until the advent of New Historicism, works of imaginative literature tended not to be related to their larger cultural context.
-----Whatever about his need for patronage (a consequence surely of his being born without title or property), love him or loath him, he had a very clear understanding of the problem successive English administrations faced in their efforts to make Ireland British. Not until Sir John Davies (1569-1626) later book detailing why England failed to impose its stamp on Ireland do we such a clear minded critique of 'what needs to be done' (as Vladimir Lenin put it). While Davies book is in many respects an elaborate  and dispassionate post-mortem, Spenser's 'View' represents a chilling prognosis.
In a European context, broadly speaking, England saw itself as defending its sovereignty by extending it to Ireland which (at least until 1985 with the Anglo-Irish agreement) it regarded as falling within its immediate strategic interest.
So, Spenser's epic supplied the proscenium arch, the narrative frame for an epic struggle of two competing ideologies or belief systems which are still working themselves out on the island of Ireland. As the author  of this history reminds the reader, the history of Ireland since Spenser's time in Ireland (the late 16th Century) is in so many ways a playing-out of the Faerie Queene, the story of an epic struggle by chivalrous knights attempting to impose the, as they see it, correct moral order on barbarous Others. And, as so often happens, the prescribed cure is much worse than the malady.
--------Spenser made the naive mistake in his epic of 'Othering' (demonising) the departed Stuart dynasty, (notably the Catholic Mary Queen of Scots, Duessa, a type of moth) which was returned to power with the death of a childless Elizabeth Tudor in 1603.
The events detailed in this book, covering 70 years to 1650, permanently shaped Ireland and, as historiographers have latterly come to realise with not a little object-relational irony, that of England also as it was in Ireland that England first encountered the question how an occupying force might not just physically subdue people with a different cultural and legal tradition but how, or if indeed, they could be made British. 
So, at the beginning of the so called 'Age of Discovery', administrators in England considered not just the manner and the means of geographic expansion but also, crucially, whether it could export its language, its culture, and ultimately its mode of government to less developed (certainly in terms of technology and formal institutions) parts of the globe.
In examining events in Ireland it is well to bear in mind that Ireland was only one site in a large theatre of war. The two Desmond Rebellions (Munster 1569, 1579) for example occurred between the French Wars of Religion (1562) and the Anglo-Spanish War of 1585. This, not to mention the lingering effects of the Reformation, the counter-Reformation, the English Civil War, the Commonwealth or the Restoration. 
To highlight just how intertwined the history of these two islands are (as this study emphasises), no sooner had England under Cromwell finally conquered Ireland, the English Commonwealth gave way to the Restoration when Charles II restored much of the property confiscated from Irish leaders in the Irish phase of the War of the Three Kingdoms (the English Civil War). 
So many fine works of history are marred because historians quite understandably haven't been able to muster or harness the requisite literary-critical acumen, what I think Frederic Jamison referred to as 'the mastery of perplexing idiolects'. -Not so here. 
If the reader imagines that the events featured in these pages are of no relevance to their own lives and surroundings, he can be reminded that though the action is centered in the British Isles, the plot, whereby at least two cultures come into fierce contact, can be read as a critique of every other conflict where languages and traditions clash, whether Columbus or Cortes in the Americas, Russia in the Ukraine, China in Tibet, Germany's 1930s claim for more living space, or the Eastern Europe of today as it resists EU rubrics, to mention but a few.
End.
A few observations about Edmund Spenser.
This study begins with Edmund Spenser, recently rusticated to Ireland still in in his twenties, a beneficiary of Gaelic land dispossession, whose new found wealth and position gave him a real stake in ensuring that England spread the new gospel of secular self sufficiency (albeit with a Protestant face) as he mulled over how best to bring those he saw as barbarous to sense. Spenser, keenly aware of the threats to his new found status, wrote to influence government policy. 
What differentiates Spenser as a government official and perhaps explains why he clearly identified the challenges for England in Ireland was the fact that he had a personal stake (his only stake as he was born without title or influence) in the success of the English government's new venture in Ireland in the form of a confiscated estate in County Cork.
So many books on Edmund Spenser's main work are marred because such is the length of the Faerie Queene (six books, twelve originally planned) and such are their contents that the typical reader quickly becomes snowed in under all the detail, the cast of characters exceeding that of Richard III, the reader's energy dissipates under the weight of events. -Not so here. 
For fifty years, some critics have been trying to rescue Spenser from a different type of critic who seemingly abjuring the rise of Historicism have preferred a focus on allegory and archetype in Spenser to what might be called surface or pragmatic readings of the poem.
Frank Kermode, borrowing a quote from Joyce criticism explains that "The mistake in short is to 'be led away into exploring the possible significance the myths used [sic] may be thought to possess in themselves, into infinite speculations regarding archetypal patterns and analogies, instead of the realized meaning of the work itself' ".
So, getting a little ahead of ourselves here, what has an epic poem, the allegorical depiction of chivalrous knights enforcing what they or their creator saw as the correct moral order, written in Ireland around 1580 by an inventive poet and junior government official, got to do with the signing of the Atlantic Charter in 1941 'to guarantee the right to self determination of small nations' and 'to restore self government to those to whom it had been denied'?
The short answer is absolutely everything and this persuasive study, without straying beyond 1650 (or mentioning the Atlantic Charter) rescues Spenser from the allegorists by tracing the role of imaginative literature in formulating official government policy, the word made flesh. 
This book furnishes the reader with passages from the imaginative writing of the period, detailing how works of literature were in fact the sites of the geo-political imagination. Irish language accounts of the Cromwellian conquest (as mentioned previously) fortify the accounts that have been handed down to us from posterity. Edward Said's study 'Culture & Imperialism' will sit very comfortably next to this work.
I may be wrong but I imagine this book owes something to the rise of New Historicism. Prior to about 1970 at least within the discipline of Literature, literary theorists on both sides of the Atlantic rigidly proscribed any examination of the background to works of imaginative literature. I cannot speak to orthodoxies in the discipline of History except to cite EL Carr's wonderful study which probes the unavoidable ideology of the historian. (I cannot detect any ideology at work in this wonderful study).
Previously dominated by New Criticism, texts began to be studied in other contexts which lead theorists, for example, Edward Said to examine the relationship between Jane Austen's 'Mansfield Park' and the institution of slavery. Likewise, Jane Eyre was re-examined, quite contrary to its traditional literary reception, for what it said about domestic incarceration, madness, and the laws pertaining to divorce, inheritance, remarriage, and so on.
Perhaps to demonstrate that a man's fortunes could be determined by a diligent application of his talents, that his fortunes lay not in his stars but in his self, Spenser's heroes in the Faerie Queene are portrayed as having a civilising effect on their environment, the implicit message or at least the hope being that an exemplary presence alone would eventually win the day over perceived ignorance and adversity. After 1580, Spenser was not so sure particularly as some of the villains who he had nonchalantly maligned in his epic had returned to power in the guise of the Stuarts as the Tudor line ended with a childless Elizabeth, the eponymous heroine of his Arthurian epic.
So, the reader learns the point of the Faerie Queene, which is to say we learn its purpose within the larger scheme of things, what Spenser sought to achieve. We learn why he wrote his epic as an allegory, we learn what it aimed to portray, why he did not finish the work and why, a little dissatisfied with what his Epic had managed to achieve, he subsequently wrote 'the View of the Present State of Ireland', a prose dialogue and a more controversial work whose contents, intimations of genocide and what would today be called ethnic cleansing,  were not lost on Oliver Cromwell who later subdued Ireland in a series of routs which are still remembered with bitterness. 
Reading about Spenser in traditional works, the reader often comes away informed but unsatisfied with that dread feeling that an opportunity has been missed, to present the work as part of a larger socio-political and cultural landscape. This study provides that context. Sir John Davies (much later) masterful summary on why England repeatedly failed to bring Ireland to heel finds ample expression in chapter two of this book as the political theories of chapter one come face to face with the realities on the ground. Easy to invade but difficult to hold, much harder to rule or coerce the native population to enjoy the 'sweetness of subjection', the scene is set for a series of Plantations which were expected to bring about a final solution to at least England's woes in Ireland after a number of other strategies had exhausted themselves. 
The subject of this book is as topical today as it was in the time of Edmund Spenser. The shadow of William Penn (1644-1718) and his decision to leave his Munster estate and instead move to America looms large as does the decision of Oliver Cromwell (1599-1658) to subdue Ireland during the Irish phase of the War of the Three Kingdoms when Gaelic Ireland supported the Royalist faction of Charles I.
