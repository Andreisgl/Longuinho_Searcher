One set of texts to which such an argument has been applied is that in which Jesus exercises authority over the seas (Mark 4:35–41; 6:45–52). Our study uses the portrayal of the idealized Davidic king in Ps 88:26 as one whose “hand is set to the sea” to call this specific argument into question. In the psalm, the human king participates in God’s rule over the sea without being represented as God. Ancillary support for the plausibility of a human ruling the waters comes from (1) other Judean stories of people exercising control over waters, (2) the coherence of Ps 88 with the manner Jesus is depicted more broadly in Mark, and (3) evidence that other early readers of Judean ("Jewish") scripture interpreted Psalm 88’s language about the Davidic king eschatologically.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersJournal of Biblical LiteratureThe Messiah is “the Holy One”: ὁ ἅγιος τοῦ θεοῦ as a Messianic Title in Mark 1:24, JBL 136.2 (2017): 417-332017 • Max BotnerThe christological title ὁ ἅγιος τοῦ θεοῦ (“the Holy One of God”) appears a total of three times in the New Testament (Mark 1:24; Luke 4:34; John 6:69), and is unattested in other Jewish and Christian literature. While scholars offer a wide range of proposals concerning the background and significance of this title, no one has demonstrated the possibility of a link with messianic traditions. This article fills this lacuna in two ways. First, I examine four texts (Ps 88:19 LXX; LAB 59:2; Pss 152, 153) that explicitly refer to the anointed David as God’s “holy one,” and two additional sources that indicate awareness of the archaic tradition that the oil used to anoint Israel’s kings was holy (Ps 89:21 [88:21]; 11QPsa XXVIII, 11; Josephus, Ant. 6.157). Second, I explore how the underlying logical connection between “messiah” and “holy one” within these texts illuminates certain features of Mark’s Gospel: (1) Jesus’s baptism as messianic anointing and his ensuing wilderness temptation (Mark 1:9–13), (2) the logical connection between the baptism-temptation sequence (1:9–13) and Jesus’s first act of public ministry (1:21–28), and (3) the exorcistic connotations surrounding the “son of David” title.Download Free PDFView PDFReconfiguring the Akedah and Recasting God: Lament and Divine Abandonment in MarkMatthew RindgeDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Biblical Literature "Jesus as the Davidic Temple Builder and Peter's Priestly Role in Matthew 16:16-19"2013 • Michael P BarberIt is widely accepted that Matthew presents Jesus as fulfilling Jewish eschatological expectations, particularly, Davidic hopes. However, although Jesus frequently speaks positively about his disciples’ participation in the cult in Matthew’s narrative (e.g., Matt 5:23-24), little attention has been paid to Matthew’s interest in Christ’s fulfillment of the cultic dimensions of future hopes. In fact, ancient Jewish sources repeatedly express not only the belief in an eschatological temple but also expectations of a reformed and/or new priesthood. This paper argues that such hopes inform Matthew 16:17–19. It begins by arguing that Jesus’ building of the church is best understood in light of Matthew’s Davidic Christology, an aspect of the evangelist’s portrait of Jesus that many scholars have noted. Specifically, building on the work of others, it argues that Jesus’ response to Peter’s confession involves allusions to Davidic traditions of temple-building (cf. 2 Sam 7:12–13; 1 Chron 17:7–10)(e.g., Ådna, Meyer, Wright). Going on, this article demonstrates that Jesus’ description of Peter’s role in the following verses seems to portray him as one holding a priestly role. In particular, as many scholars have noted, Jesus’ words to Peter appear echo the description of Eliakim in Isaiah 22 (e.g., Davies and Allison, Hagner, Willis). What is frequently overlooked is that this passage describes Eliakim as wearing garments usually associated with the high priest (cf. Isa 22:21 with Exod 28:4), an aspect of the passage not lost on Jewish readers (e.g., Tg. on Isaiah; b. Ta’an. 29a). “Binding” and “loosing” also seem linked to responsibilities typically associated with the priesthood (teaching, judging, mediating divine forgiveness). In light of this we shall argue that this passage provides Jesus with the perfect quarry: if the church is a temple, its leadership is naturally described in terms of priestly responsibilities.Download Free PDFView PDFMatthew's Titulus and Psalm 2's King on Mount Zion_JBL 133Tucker FerdaDownload Free PDFView PDFAudience Inclusion and Exclusion as Rhetorical Technique in the Gospel of MarkSteve  Ahearne-KrollDownload Free PDFView PDF“Foreshadowing, Echoes and the Blasphemy at the Cross (Mark 15:29).” Journal of Biblical Literature 132 (2013): 911-31.Joel F WilliamsDarrell Bock has proposed that Mark’s Gospel includes an alternating pattern of accusations concerning blasphemy, with the final step in this pattern taking place when Mark characterizes the mocking at the cross as blasphemy (15:29–32). This final accusation, typically obscured by translators and commentators alike, is the subject of this article. The contention that Mark considered the mocking at the cross to be an expression of blasphemy and that this accusation of blasphemy reflects back on earlier accusations in the narrative can be supported by carefully examining Mark’s narrative rhetoric, especially his use of foreshadowing and echoes. Mark’s passion narrative often uses verbal links to the preceding narrative to communicate Mark’s perspective on the events surrounding Jesus’ death and resurrection. Therefore, this article examines the pervasive, patterned, and concentrated use of echoes in Mark’s passion narrative to demonstrate that Mark used his reference to blasphemy in 15:29 to reflect back on earlier accusations of blasphemy in the narrative. Through this final reference to blasphemy, Mark communicates that it is ultimately dishonoring to God and God’s work in the world to suggest that God would send a messiah who would choose to save himself rather than others.Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of Biblical LiteratureThe Christology of Early Christian Practice2008 • Thomas KazenDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Biblical LiteratureA Collective Anointed? David and the People in Psalm 892020 • Marcel  KruscheIt has been suggested by Timo Veijola and several other exegetes that the anointed one dealt with in Ps 89 does not mean an individual Judean king or the Davidic dynasty but the whole people of Israel. Psalm 89 thus witnesses to a collectivization of the divine promises given to David. In the present article, I critique this thesis of collectivization. To be sure, David and the people are closely related to each other in the psalm but at the same time clearly distinguished from each other. In the whole Hebrew Bible, there is no unequivocal evidence for a collective meaning of the title ‫משיח‬ ("anointed"). The textual and reception history of Ps 89 suggests that the collectivization of the Davidic figure is a phenomenon of reception rather than conforming to the original meaning of the psalm.Download Free PDFView PDFThe Biblical Odes and the Text of the Christian Bible: A Reconsideration of the Impact of Liturgical Singing on the Transmission of the Gospel of LukeJennifer Knust, Tommy  WassermanSung in Christian liturgies from the earliest period, biblical Odes—a set of songs excerpted from the biblical and apocryphal books—were central to emerging Christian practices and texts, yet their significance as textual witnesses has rarely been studied. Overlooked by text critics and editors, the Odes have largely been omitted from contemporary critical editions of the biblical books, including the very recent twenty-eighth edition of the Nestle-Aland Novum Testamentum Graece. This analysis suggests, however, that the liturgical setting of the Odes had a double impact: whereas some of the readings possibly reflect liturgical adaptation , public performance could also set limits on how much these texts could change. Comparison of the biblical Odes as they appear in the great fifth-century majuscule Codex Alexandrinus, both in their place among the Odes and within their appropriate biblical book, demonstrates that these songs are in fact a valuable textual resource, a conclusion that is further confirmed by an examination of the textual and paratextual features of early Odes manuscripts. A more focused study of the Song of Mary offers additional support to the hypothesis: this song remained remarkably fixed even as Odes traditions and collections remained unsettled. As this study shows, interactions between oral and written forms of transmission are complex, and thus no textual witness can be dismissed solely on the basis of its liturgical setting.Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of Biblical LiteratureCannibalistic Language in the Fourth Gospel and Greco-Roman Polemics of Factionalism (John 6: 52-66)2008 • J.
