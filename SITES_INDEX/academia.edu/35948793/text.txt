(REVISED VERSION)See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersThe Leeuwengroten of the Wittmund Hoard (1858)Paul Torongo, Raymond van OosterhoutThere are three German coin hoards that are of great importance to the study of the leeuwengroten of all regions: Wittmund (1858), Byvanck (1860), and Schoo (1927), which we lovingly call “the big three”. It is our intention to report on these three important hoards separately, followed by a report on their relationship to one another. The contents of these hoards are similar to one another, all of them containing significant numbers of rare leeuwengroten struck in small regions such as Horne and Fauquemont (Valkenburg), as well as large numbers of gros tournois. Previous reports on these hoards were written by Dannenberg; Berghaus, (and Meyer) (Wittmund); von Frauendorfer (Byvanck); and Suhle, Berghaus (Schoo). None of these previous reports are without errors or problems, however. In the case of the Wittmund Hoard, for example, no one ever reported the total number of coins that the find contained, Dannenberg and Berghaus both list coins not listed by the other, Meyers’ illustrations of the coins are hopelessly inaccurate, and so on. We also provide, for the first time, photographs of the known Wittmund Hoard leeuwengroten (previously unpublished).Download Free PDFView PDFFive Extremely Important Leeuwengroten You Have Never Seen Before: Coevorden, Rekem, Namur and GueldersPaul TorongoThe title says it all.Download Free PDFView PDFThe Extremely Important Leeuwengroten of the Schoo Hoard (1927)Paul Torongo, Raymond van OosterhoutThe hoard was discovered in a crop field on February 9, 1927, during routine plowing. The coins had been buried in a wooden chest, and were fused together into a solid mass. After separation and cleaning, the hoard was found to contain 2 gold and 267 silver coins, as well as 317 silver coin fragments (or broken coins). A number of the lower-fineness coins had broken into smaller pieces; in total, some 71.7 grams of unidentifiable material were left over, along with the whole coins and identifiable fragments [25]. Most of the coins (about ¾ of the total) in the hoard were silver leeuwengroten, similar to the coins pictured on p. 1 above. The remaining ¼ were gros tournois from several regions, as well as a small number of other types of coins (including 2 gold pieces). Our primary interest in the Schoo Hoard is the leeuwengroten. Other than our own recent publications, no photographs of the Schoo Hoard leeuwengroten have been published before.Download Free PDFView PDFA Preliminary Look at the Rare Leeuwengroten of Valkenburg (Fauquemont)Paul Torongo, Raymond van OosterhoutLeeuwengroten with legends reading MONETA FALCN and MONETA FALEN (and "William" reverse legends) have traditionally been attributed to Valkenburg (Fauquemont), in the modern Netherlands province of Limburg. These attributions are based for the most part on the upon the legends themselves (and the lack of any other place names that 'match'). There is a third 'William' legend, MONETA FAUC'N, that has gone completely unreported by previous authors.Download Free PDFView PDFPreviously Unpublished Fractional Leeuwengroten Struck For the Bishop of Utrecht at Vollenhove (and Zwolle ?)Paul Torongo, Raymond van OosterhoutFor this article, we turn our attention to the fractional coins struck at Vollenhove, which in the 14 th century was in the Oversticht, the northwestern lands held by the Bishops of Utrecht. (At certain times, the town was in the hands of the Dukes of Guelders.) The town is now in the modern province of Overijssel in The Netherlands. Four types of fractional, Vollenhove leeuwengroten are known to exist, and another type reported (but unconfirmed). The diameter of these coins is approximately 17 mm. Whether or not these fractionals can be associated with any full groten is uncertain at this time (but several places appear to have minted fractionals without ever minting the full groten). The Bishops of Utrecht of the period generally minted coins with a bishop's head as a type, not a lion. The five fractional leeuwengroot types are known from only six specimens.Download Free PDFView PDFThe Leeuwengroten of the Lordship of Rummen: A Preliminary OverviewPaul Torongo, Raymond van OosterhoutThe two main types of Rummen leeuwengroot (gros au lion) have been known to numismatists for some 180 years (RUMEN and FRAND). The numerous sub-types, however, have never before been cataloged.Download Free PDFView PDFThe Leeuwengroten of the Lordship of Horne: A Preliminary OverviewPaul Torongo, Raymond van OosterhoutLike most small realms of the Middle Ages, Horne is not well represented in the history books nor in the available medieval records, making information about the region difficult to come by. The leeuwengroot (gros au lion, gros compagnon, gezel, socius) was struck in the Lordship of Horne at the mints of Weert and Wessem. There are 3 main types and a number of sub-types known, all of which were struck for "Dirk of Horne" who is likely to be Dirk-Loef, self-styled Lord of Horne (1357-1368) (See Appendix A: Who was Dirk of Horne?, below for details). The 3 types are referred to by the word after MONETA on the obverse (and the name on the reverse), as follows: cat. I VESMN cat. II VIERD / DIRIC cat. III VIERD / THEO (The VESMN coins have the name DEDERIC on the reverse, but since there is only one Wessem type, we dispense with the "/ DEDERIC" for the sake of convenience.)Download Free PDFView PDFA Unique, Unpublished Leeuwengroot Struck For the Bishop of UtrechtPaul Torongo, Raymond van OosterhoutFound in 1991, this unique and important coin has never been described in any numismatic or archeological publication.Download Free PDFView PDFA Preliminary Overview of the Leeuwengroten of Brabant Part One: BrusselsPaul Torongo, Raymond van OosterhoutLeeuwengroten were stuck in Brabant under John III (1312-1355). Minting of Brabançon leeuwengroten began while Louis of Nevers was Count of Flanders, and continued on and off into the reign of Louis of Mâle in Flanders. There are three basic, “main” types: two rare sorts with a MONETA BRVXELL(EN) obverse legend and either DVX BRABANTIE or IO DVX BRABAN on the reverse (respectively), and the third type, the relatively common MONETA BRABAN / IO DVX LOT BRAB coins. Leeuwengroten were also struck in Brabant for John III’s daughter Jeanne (Johanna) (1355-1406) and her husband Wenceslas (1355-1383), who was also Duke of Luxembourg.Download Free PDFView PDFPreviously Unpublished Fractional Leeuwengroten of John II of Kuinre (1337 -c. 1360Paul Torongo, Raymond van OosterhoutTo date, 1 type of John of Kuinre, fractional leeuwengroot has been published.
