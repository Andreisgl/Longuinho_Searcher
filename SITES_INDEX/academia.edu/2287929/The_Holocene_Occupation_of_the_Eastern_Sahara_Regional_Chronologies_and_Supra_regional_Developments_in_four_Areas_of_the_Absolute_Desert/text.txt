Contributions to the Archaeology and Environmental History of Africa in Honour of Rudolph Kuper. Africa Praehistorica 14. Köln 2002, 85-116Abstract The following paper examines the climatic and cultural changes that occurred in the Eastern Sahara during the Holocene. The evidence is given from different areas of the absolute desert located on the Abu Muhariq Plateau (Djara), in the Abu Ballas scarp-land (Eastpans) in the Great Sand Sea (Regenfeld) and in the Gilf Kebir (Wadi el Bakht, Wadi el Akhdar). Each area has also yielded an independent sequence of occupation patterns during the Holocene wet phase based on numerous 14C-dates from archaeological sites. Although the wider frame of climatic and environmental settings as well as the predominant cultural innovations was similar in all studied regions, the archaeological phenomena and thereby identified cultural processes were often quite different. Pottery played an important role during the entire period of occupation in the Gilf Kebir and is therefore the most important cultural marker in this area. The Regenfeld area yielded only a small amount of ceramic finds from the later occupation phase, whereas the Djara region showed 'aceramic' settlement units. Plant utilisation apparently increased in all areas during the mid-Holocene period. Up to now, we have not observed the introduction of livestock before the 6th millennium BC (calibrated), while at the inner Great Sand Sea remains of domesticated animals are lacking.

Kröpelin (2004) Wadi Bakht revisited: Holocene climate change and prehistoric occupation in the Gilf Kebir region of the Eastern Sahara, SW Egypt. Jörg LinstädterGeoarchaeological and chronological evidence from the remote Gilf Kebir Plateau in southwestEgypt suggests a new model for the influence of early and mid-Holocene precipitation regimeson land-use strategies of prehistoric settlers in what is now the center of the largest hyperaridarea on earth. We hypothesize that the quantitatively higher, daytime, monsoon summer rain-fall characteristic of the early Holocene (9300–5400) 14C yr B.P./8400–4300 yr B.C.) resulted inless grass growth on the plateau compared to the winter rains that presumably fell in the coolnights during the terminal phase of the Holocene pluvial (5400–4500 yr B.P./4300–3300 yr B.C.).The unparalleled climatic transition at 5400 yr B.P. (4300 yr B.C.) caused a fundamental envi-ronmental change that resulted in different patterns of human behavior, economy, and land usein the canyon-like valleys and on the plains surrounding the plateau. The model emphasizesthe crucial impact of seasonal rainfall distribution on cultural landscapes in arid regions andthe lower significance of annual precipitation rates, with implications for future numeric cli-mate models. It also serves as an example of how past climate changes have affected humansocieties.Download Free PDFView PDFQuaternary Science Reviews 25Palaeoenvironment and Holocene land use of Djara, Western Desert of Egypt.2006 • Karin KindermannThe results of the interdisciplinary project ACACIA support the assumption of a more humid climate at Djara, on the Egyptian Limestone Plateau, which is a hyper-arid desert today, during the early and mid-Holocene. The ancient plant and animal inventories give new impetus for the suggestion of an interfingering of two climatic regimes, the winter rains from the north and west and the summer monsoonal rains from the south, on the latitude of Djara. A playa sediment sequence, the composition of plant and animal taxa as well as the reconstructed settlement patterns indicate a semi-arid climate with alternating more humid and drier conditions.The concentration of prehistoric sites in the Djara depression points to locally favourable conditions in contrast to the surrounding plateau surface. The widespread catchment and a distinct system of palaeochannels offered fresh water over a period of time due to the run-off from the plateau surface after rain events. Although the ecological conditions were better during the Holocene humid phase than they are today, a sedentary way of life was improbable. The hydrological constraints require altogether highly mobile subsistence strategies. Shells of the Nile bivalve Aspatharia sp. (Spathopsis sp.) give evidence for contacts between Djara and the Nile Valley, which remains beside the Egyptian oases an important retreat area with perennially available water. The decrease of radiocarbon dates and related archaeological sites around 6300 BP (c. 5300 cal BC) indicate the depopulation of the Djara region as a consequence of the drying trend. While the drop off of the 14C-dates can also be observed in other desert research areas of the ACACIA-project, we date the end of the Holocene humid phase about 300 years earlier than previously suggested.Download Free PDFView PDFin: Tides of the Desert – Gezeiten der WüsteMenschliche Skelettreste aus dem Wadi Howar (Sudan) – vorläufige anthropologische Befunde2002 • Michael StangEven though the skeletal remains from Wadi Howar, with which this contribution is concerned, displayed a rather poor state of preservation, some interesting conclusions could be drawn from their preliminary study. The material seemed to be divided into two morphologically distinct groups. The first of these two groups consisted of the individuals S 95/4 and S 95/2-3. Both skeletons displayed certain characteristics also found among palaeolithic human remains from Nubia. The second of these groups was formed by the archaeologically associated individuals S 96/1-1, S 96/1-2, and S 96/4 on the one hand, and the likewise associated individuals S 96/120-3, S 96/120-4, and S 96/120-5 on the other. The members of this second group were considerably less robust than S 95/4 and S 95/2-3 and exhibited traits normally associated with negroid populations. Regrettably, the question whether the former of the two groups (which contains the older and more robust skeletal remains) could be considered ancestral to the latter (which is younger and gracile) could not be answered conclusively on the basis of this osteological analysis.

It stresses to systematise the discussion about possible similarities in cultural traits, and points out the contact patterns and their mechanisms. As the environmental conditions played an important role forthe contact patterns, the climatic development is the most important point to stress. The changing conditions during the three millennia in question, at least, provoke a preliminary four-phased chronology of the changing contacts.Download Free PDFView PDFLiving in an Egyptian Oasis: Reconstruction of the Holocene Archaeological Sequence in KhargaFrançois Briois, Tiphaine Dachy, Mathilde MinottiWithin the Egyptian Western Desert, the Kharga Oasis was a particularly favourable and highly frequented area during the Holocene thanks to a permanent ground water supply. The high concentration and accessibility of archaeological sites here allows the cultural and economic changes to be documented at a local scale, when northeastern Africa was experiencing strong climatic variations and the transition to a food production economy. An expansive program led by the Institut français d’archéologie orientale (IFAO) which included systematic survey, sampling collections, tests and stratigraphic excavations has dramatically increased the amount of data available concerning the prehistory of the Kharga Oasis. Typo-technological analyses focusing on the lithic industries, and other aspects of material culture, plus a series of 14C dates have led to the definition of four main successive cultural phases: Kharga A, B, C and D. This paper describes this proposal of a new archaeological sequence for human occupation in the Kharga Oasis and discusses its integration in the wider frame of Egypt and the Eastern Sahara.Download Free PDFView PDFStudies in African Archaeology 16 (ISBN 978-83-60109-61-8; PL ISSN 0866-9244)In Search of the Origins of Lower Egyptian Pottery: A New Approach to Old Data2018 • Agnieszka MączyńskaDownload Free PDFView PDFCristiani E.
