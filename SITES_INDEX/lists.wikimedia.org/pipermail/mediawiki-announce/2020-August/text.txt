[MediaWiki-announce] MediaWiki 1.35.0-rc.2 is ready for testing

I'm pleased to announce the immediate availability of MediaWiki
1.35.0-rc.2, the third release candidate for 1.35.x, the next LTS version
to replace 1.31 which is due to go end of life in June 2021. Download links
at the end of the e-mail. The tag has been signed and pushed to Git.
Please note that the PHP version requirement has been raised from 7.2.9 in
MediaWiki 1.34 (and 7.0 in MediaWiki 1.31), to 7.2.22 (this may change
further, see below).
This is not a final release and should not be used for production websites.
Known issues are tracked in Phabricator on the release workboard [1]. As
always please do try out the release candidate in a test environment and
report any issues that you discover. Please use the #MW-1.35-Release [2]
tag in Phabricator when reporting issues specific to this release.
It is expected that MediaWiki 1.35 will become final in late August 2020,
and will be supported for 3 years after that.
Known/outstanding issues/things to test:
* It has been proposed to require PHP 7.3 for MediaWiki 1.35, please
discuss at <https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T257879>.
* Both the Vector skin and the underlying skin infrastructure are
undergoing numerous changes, so there might be things broken that are
already fixed in master and as such need backporting.
* VisualEditor and Parsoid are now bundled in the tarball and no longer
need a separate nodejs service. The documentation for this still needs to
be updated, and in some cases, users are reporting HTTP 500 errors from
RestBase <https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T259693>.
* Watchlist expiry (behind the $wgWatchlistExpiry flag) is currently
experimental. It should be finished for the 1.35.0 final release.
* If you're on Windows and use 7zip and had issues in the previous release
candidates (and the last round of security releases) extracting the
tarball, this should be fixed for this release.
* While the rc.2 tarballs are smaller than the rc.1 tarballs, the patch for
rc.2 is much larger than usual, due to the removal of Gruntfile.js and
package-lock.json files from the tarball.
Changes since 1.35.0-rc.1:
* (T259693) uuid: Fix filenames on Windows.
* Remove Gruntfile.js and package-lock.json from the tarball.
* firejail: Strengthen by copying from Wikimedia's profile.
* (T260059) ResourceLoaderOOUIImageModule: loadOOUIDefinition() may return
  false.
* (T30162, T245387) The installer supports using a Postgres server running
  on a custom port other than 5432.
* (T260201) Support private wikis in Parsoid zero configuration mode.
* Fix bad use of `|=` PHP bit operation where `= … ||` bool is intended.
* (T259212) SpecialBlock: Show error if a block could not be inserted or
found.
* (T255842) UserOptionsManager: fix options reset.
* (T258649) WatchAction: avoid unnecessary UPDATEs when expiry is unchanged.
* (T250851) Allow skins to override mediawiki.page.ready initialisation.
* (T250851) mediawiki.page.ready: Allow skins to disable search lazy load.
* (T253135, T255632) Update language in watchlist expiry.
* Use IPset in MWRestrictions::checkIP.
* (T259564) Fix race condition on edit page.
* (T260759) Hide watchlist expiry label in edit form.
* mime: Fix docs of MIME_EXTENSIONS, they're arrays, not space-seperated.
* (T260031) Add application/font-sfnt to MimeMap for ttf files.
* (T259379) WatchedItemStore: Cache single WatchedItems with preexisting
expiry.
* Add a maintenance script to create bot passwords.
* (T201269) Add Traditional Chinese zh-hant as fallback for Amis (ami).
* Improve wfParseUrl docs.
* (T251038) Add multi index fields in ImageListPager for unique paginate.
* (T259916) Guard against 'Widget not found' error.
