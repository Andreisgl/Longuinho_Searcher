Abortion and euthanasia are often assumed to violate the doctrine. The doctrine is usually understood as being derived from religious dogma and, as such, not amenable to debate. I show that this characterisation of the doctrine is problematic in a number of ways, and I go on to rethink the doctrine. In doing so I follow in the footsteps of Ronald Dworkin, who offered a characterisation of the doctrine in his 1993Life's Dominion, drawing on a conceptualisation of sacredness that is radically different from standard ones and not dependent on religious dogma. I'll argue that although Dworkin's efforts have much to recommend, his conceptualisation of sacredness is inadequate. Dworkin attempted to reconceptualise sacredness ‘from the armchair’. Here I explain how sacred values are thought of in anthropology and psychology and argue that the sanctity of human life should be understood in the same way. I'll explain how doing so allows us to resolve a number of conceptual problems that bedevil standard characterisations of the doctrine of the sanctity of life. I'll also consider the possibility of a compromise over the sanctity of human life, and as a consequence, compromise over the permissibility of abortion and euthanasia. I'll argue that such compromise is possible, albeit difficult to achieve.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Here I argue that while Robinson is right to oppose the argument from voluntariness, he misunderstands current arrangements for managing CO in healthcare, and he misses the force of the non-accommodationist case against those arrangements. I also argue that despite what he says, Robinson is as much a proponent of reform of the management of CO in healthcare as are his non-accommodationist opponents. In addition, I raise a concern about Robinson’s preferred approach to managing CO in healthcare.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Their examples include Donald Trump’s allegations that elections have been rigged, ‘Birther’ accusations about Barack Obama, ‘QAnon’ and ‘Pizzagate’. They characterize these as ‘conspiracism without the theory’. They argue that the new conspiracism is validated by repetition, disregards experts, and is satisfied with the conclusion that allegations are ‘true enough’. Here I argue that there is no new conspiracism. Muirhead and Rosenblum have misconstrued their chief examples of new conspiracism and mischaracterized classic conspiracism. The non-existence of a new conspiracism matters. If those studying contemporary conspiracism suppose that many of the objects of their study are theory-free then they are liable to fail to examine the theories that actually are driving contemporary conspiracism. Also, if they suppose that they are confronting an entirely new phenomenon then they are in danger of failing to learn lessons from the rich history of conspiracy theorizing.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Huckleberry Finn's Conscience: Reckoning with the EvasionJournal of Ethics,  2020Huck Finn's struggles with his conscience, as depicted in Mark Twain's famous novel The Adventure... more Huck Finn's struggles with his conscience, as depicted in Mark Twain's famous novel The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (AHF) (1884), have been much discussed by philosophers; and various philosophical lessons have been extracted from Twain's depiction of those struggles. Two of these philosophers stand out, in terms of influence: Jonathan Bennett and Nomy Arpaly. Here I argue that the lessons that Bennett and Arpaly draw are not supported by a careful reading of AHF. This becomes particularly apparent when we consider the final part of the book, commonly referred to, by literary scholars, as 'the evasion'. During the evasion Huck behaves in ways that are extremely difficult to reconcile with the interpretations of AHF offered by Bennett and Arpaly. I extract a different philosophical lesson from AHF than either Bennett or Arpaly, which makes sense of the presence of the evasion in AHF. This lesson concerns the importance of conscious moral deliberation for moral guidance and for overcoming wrongful moral assumptions. I rely on an interpretation of AHF that is influential in literary scholarship. On it the evasion is understood as an allegory about US race relations during the 20-year period from the end of the US Civil War to the publication of AHF.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

M&P also object on ethical grounds to policies of scientific funding agencies that encourage scientists to replace vertebrates by invertebrates in research. M&P do allow that some invertebrates with brains may have lower levels of moral status than some vertebrates, but this seems to conflict with their case against replacement policies. See: https://www.wellbeingintlstudiesrepository.org/animsent/vol5/iss29/33/Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Bioconservatism, bioenhancement and backfiringby Steve Clarke and Tamara Kayali BrowneJournal of Moral EducationThe prospect of enhancing ourselves through the use of new biotechnologies is for the most part, ... more The prospect of enhancing ourselves through the use of new biotechnologies is for the most part, hypothetical. Nevertheless, the question of whether we should undertake such enhancement is worthy of discussion as it may become possible in the future. In this article, we consider one form of argument that conservative opponents of biotechnological means of enhancement (bioconservatives) deploy in opposition to the use of enhancement technologies—the backfiring objection. This is the objection that the use of such technologies is liable to go wrong and lead to outcomes that are inferior to the outcomes intended. We will argue that the objection is not nearly as significant as bioconservatives suppose it to be. Bioconservatives sometimes supplement the backfiring objection by arguing that change will be irreversible, that the new (or the unconventional) is especially liable to backfire and that humans possess severe and permanent limitations which cannot be overcome. We consider these ways of supplementing the backfiring objection and argue that each of them, when properly understood, is of limited value to the bioconservative. We also consider how traditional approaches to moral education can be supplemented by bioenhancement.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Straight out of Durkheim?

He describes the participation-centric view as ‘Straight out of Durkheim’. I argue that this is a misreading of Durkheim, who held that religious behaviour and commitment are the joint products of belief and participation, with neither belief nor participation being considered more important than the other. I further argue that recent evidence from the cognitive science of religion provides support for Durkheim’s balanced account of religion and counts strongly against Haidt’s participation-centric view of religion. I suggest that Haidt’s adherence to the participation-centric view of religion is better explained by his desire to accept an account of religion that is consistent with his social intuitionist moral psychology than by his desire to accept an account of religion that accords with available scientific evidence about religion.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
A Prospect Theory Approach to Understanding ConservatismPhilosophia,  2017There is widespread agreement about a combination of attributes that someone needs to possess if ... more There is widespread agreement about a combination of attributes that someone needs to possess if they are to be counted as a conservative. They need to lack definite political ideals, goals or ends, to prefer the political status quo to its alternatives, and to be risk averse. Why should these three highly distinct attributes, which are widely believed to be characteristic of adherents to a significant political position, cluster together? In this paper I draw on prospect theory to develop an explanation for the clustering of attributes that is characteristic of conservatives. I argue that a lack of political ideals is the underlying driver of conservatism. I will provide reason to believe that people who lack political ideals are disposed to prefer the political status quo to its alternatives; and reason to believe that people who prefer the political status quo to its alternatives are disposed to be risk averse, at least with respect to significantly many of the risks that arise in the social and political domain. I also consider and reject some other potential explanations for the clustering of attributes that is characteristic of conservatives and sketch some policy implications that follow from the explanation I develop.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In this article we examine vaccine refusals that... more Vaccine refusal occurs for a variety of reasons. In this article we examine vaccine refusals that are made on conscientious grounds; that is, for religious , moral, or philosophical reasons. We focus on two questions: first, whether people should be entitled to conscientiously object to vaccination against contagious diseases (either for themselves or for their children); second , if so, to what constraints or requirements should conscientious objection (CO) to vaccination be subject. To address these questions, we consider an analogy between CO to vaccination and CO to military service. We argue that conscientious objectors to vaccination should make an appropriate contribution to society in lieu of being vaccinated. The contribution to be made will depend on the severity of the relevant disease(s), its morbidity, and also the likelihood that vaccine refusal will lead to harm. In particular, the contribution required will depend on whether the rate of CO in a given population threatens herd immunity to the disease in question: for severe or highly contagious diseases, if the population rate of CO becomes high enough to threaten herd immunity, the requirements for CO could become so onerous that CO, though in principle permissible, would be de facto impermissible.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In this paper, I consider an aspect of this analogy that has not, to my knowledge, been considered in debates about conscientious objection in healthcare. In the USA and elsewhere, tribunals have been tasked with the responsibility of recommending particular forms of alternative service for conscientious objectors. Military conscripts who have a conscientious objection to active military service, and whose objections are deemed acceptable, are required either to serve the military in a non-combat role, or assigned some form of community service that does not contribute to the effectiveness of the military. I argue that consideration of the role that military tribunals have played in determining the appropriate form of alternative service for conscripts who are conscientious objectors can help us to understand how conscientious objectors in healthcare ought to be treated. Additionally, I show that it helps us to address the vexed issue of whether or not conscientious objectors who refuse to provide a service requested by a patient should be required to refer that patient to another healthcare professional.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

As a consequence, there are currently no practical limits on the scope of conscience-based refusals in healthcare. Recently a number of bioethicists, including Meyers and Woods, Card, and Kantymir and McLeod, have raised concerns about this situation and have offered proposals to place principled limits on the scope of conscience-based refusals in healthcare. Here I seek to adjudicate between their proposals. I argue that to adjudicate between them properly we need to consider the theoretical bases for conscientious objection. I further argued that there are two such bases to be considered. Some conscientious objections are justified by appeal to all-things-considered moral judgments and some are justified by appeal to the 'dictates of conscience'. I argue that both of these bases are legitimate and both should be accommodated in any principled scheme to limit the scope of conscientious refusals in healthcare.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Rethinking Moral Status Rethinking Moral Status. Edited by Steve Clarke, Hazem Zohny, and Julian Savulescu. Oxford University Press,  2021Common-sense morality implicitly assumes that reasonably clear distinctions can be drawn between ... more Common-sense morality implicitly assumes that reasonably clear distinctions can be drawn between the "full" moral status that is usually attributed to ordinary adult humans, the partial moral status attributed to non-human animals, and the absence of moral status, which is usually ascribed to machines and other artifacts. These implicit assumptions have long been challenged, and are now coming under further scrutiny as there are beings we have recently become able to create, as well as beings that we may soon be able to create, which blur the distinctions between human, non-human animal, and non-biological beings. These beings include non-human chimeras, cyborgs, human brain organoids, post-humans, and human minds that have been uploaded into computers and onto the internet and artificial intelligence. It is far from clear what moral status we should attribute to any of these beings.There are a number of ways we could respond to the new challenges these technological developments raise: we might revise our ordinary assumptions about what is needed for a being to possess full moral status, or reject the assumption that there is a sharp distinction between full and partial moral status. This volume explores such responses, and provides a forum for philosophical reflection about ordinary presuppositions and intuitions about moral status.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

We will be able to enhance many more of our abilities in more ways in the near future. Some commentators have welcomed the prospect of wide use of human enhancement technologies, while others have viewed it with alarm, and have made clear that they find human enhancement morally objectionable. The Ethics of Human Enhancement examines whether the reactions can be supported by articulated philosophical reasoning, or perhaps explained in terms of psychological influences on moral reasoning. An international team of ethicists refresh the debate with new ideas and arguments, making connections with scientific research and with related issues in moral philosophy.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Opposing unificationist view of science, Clarke suggests, needs to be understood in the context of the perceived threat of metaphysical disorder. He explores this through issues including epistemology, fundamentalism, pluralism and idealisation and identifies a potential solution similar to the work of Otto Neurath.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Rethinking our Assumptions about Moral Statusby Steve Clarke and Julian SavulescuClarke, S., Zohny, H. and Savulescu, J. (eds.) Rethinking Moral Status. Oxford, Oxford University Press, pp. 1-19.,  2021Recent technological developments and potential technological developments of the near future req... more Recent technological developments and potential technological developments of the near future require us to try to think clearly about what it is to have moral status and about when and why we should attribute moral status to beings and entities. What should we say about the moral status of human non-human chimeras, human brain organoids, artificial intelligence, cyborgs, post-humans, and human minds that have been uploaded into a computer, or onto the internet? In this introductory chapter, we survey some key assumptions ordinarily made about moral status that may require rethinking. These include the assumptions that all humans who are not severely cognitively impaired have equal moral status, that possession of the sophisticated cognitive capacities typical of human adults is necessary for full moral status, that only humans can have full moral status, and that there can be no beings with higher moral status than ordinary adult humans. We also need to consider how we should treat beings and entities when we find ourselves uncertain about their moral status.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Here I consider whether governments could and should attempt to reduce the popularity of conspiracy theorizing, especially in online environments. I consider a number of possible initiatives governments might try to reduce the popularity of conspiracy theories and I consider whether or not governments should employ some or all of these.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Buchanan and the conservative argument against human enhancement from biological and social harmonyThe Ethics of Human Enhancement: Understanding the Debate, edited by Steve Clarke, Julian Savulescu, C.

(2011), Allen Buchanan takes issue with a slew of arguments against human enhancement put forward by prominent conservatives. Here I discuss Buchanan’s treatment of the conservative line of argument against human enhancement ‘from biological and social harmony’ (Buchanan 2011, pp. 161-2). I will identify a version of this line of argument that has more going for it than Buchanan allows. I will not argue that it is strong enough to warrant the banning of the use of all human enhancement technologies, as many conservatives (and some liberals) urge, but I will argue that it gives us reason to be cautious about the widespread adoption of some possible human enhancements. I will also show that there is nothing distinctively conservative about this line of argument. It deserves to be taken seriously by both liberals and conservatives.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
A Religious Conception of EvilMoral Evil in Practical Ethics, edited by Shlomit Harrosh and Roger Crisp, London: Routledge.

In the early Twenty First Century it has been undergoing something of a revival. The philosophers who have contributed to this revival tend to downplay or ignore the religious connotations of the tern ‘evil’. Here I argue for the importance of identifying a religious conception of evil and for the importance of distinguishing this from the secular conception of evil. I also provide a definition of religious evil action. In providing a definition of religious evil action I draw of recent work in the cognitive science of religion which identifies key aspects of natural human religion that are universal. I also consider the relationship between the universal religious conception of evil I seek to locate and particular theological accounts of evil.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

On the Competence of Substance Users to Consent to Treatment ProgramsIntervening in Drug Use: Ethical Challenges, edited by John Kleinig and Stanley Einstein, Huntsville TX, OICJ Press, pp. 309-322.,  2006ABSTRACT

In this article, we set out minimum criteria for agents to count as competent to give informed consent, and argue that regular drug users—even those who are considered addicted to a drug—typically meet these conditions. Though addiction does impair autonomy, it does not impair it to a degree incompatible with the provision of informed consent. Studies of the behaviors of addicts show that they generally retain sufficient control over their behaviors and their decision making to qualify as competent to consent. Beaucoup de penseurs soutiennent que les utilisateurs de stupéfiants réguliers sont incompétents pour consentir au traitement médical. En cet article, nous établons des critères minimaux pour que les agents qualifiénnent comme comptent en tant que compétent au consentement informé, et soutenons que les utilisateurs de drogue réguliers—y compris ceux qui sont considérés toxicomanes—satisfont typiquement ces conditions. Bien que la dépendance altère l'autonomie, il ne l'altère pas à un degré incompatible avec le consentement informé. Les études du comportement des toxicomanes prouvent qu'ils gardent la maîtrise suffisante de leur comportement et de leur prise de décision pour qualifier comme compétente pour consentir.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Informed Consent and Electronic Monitoring in the WorkplaceElectronic Monitoring in the Workplace: Controversies and Solutions, edited by John Weckert, Hershey PA, Idea Group, pp. 227-241.,  2005ABSTRACT

The use of electronic monitoring devices in the workplaces of the private sector of c... more ABSTRACT The use of electronic monitoring devices in the workplaces of the private sector of capitalist economies is considered from the vantage-point of the doctrine of informed consent, a doctrine that is understood, following Clarke (2001), to be the basis for a general analysis of consenting relations. It is argued that electronic monitoring in workplace situations where employee consent is possible is unacceptable without that consent. The consent-based argument developed is compared with arguments aimed at restricting the use of electronic monitoring in the workplace that are grounded in the values of privacy and autonomy. It is argued that, whereas a consent-based argument leads to the aforementioned decisive conclusion, arguments that are grounded in the values of privacy and autonomy do not lead to any decisive conclusions that could be used to warrant restrictions on the use of contemporary electronic monitoring devices in the workplace.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This collection is an excellent contribution to the field; it fulfills and exceeds the promises of its two subsections: understanding and advancing the debate. Section 1, Understanding the Debate includes eight papers and section 2 Advancing the Debate includes seven. The collection also contains a concise introductory essay by Alberto Giubilini and Sagar Sanyal, providing a helpful overview of recent developments in the literature. It is a pleasure to read and is appropriate to use in postgraduate courses and advanced undergraduate seminars. The strengths of the collection are the papers' placement of issues in enhancement within broader debates in moral psychology, evolutionary ethics, political philosophy, and metaethics. Contextualizing in this way sheds light on the ways in which debates about novel technological innovations and their applications can provide broader insights into standing philosophical problems in other domains. The volume also strives for conceptual clarity and maps out a course through the topics, which help bypass some stubborn bottlenecks in the debate about human enhancement: 1) talking past each other, 2) conflicting methodologies, and 3) unquestioned assumptions. I highlight three sets of articles that provide ways to move past the aforementioned bottlenecks. I focus here on only a few papers for brevity, but it is worth noting that all other papers in this collection make significant contributions to dealing with bottlenecks or make worthwhile contributions to other issues in enhancement, such as the role of reason, sentiment, and emotion in moral judgments and action; disability theory; future persons; and mind-uploading and personal identity. Defenders of enhancement (and other biotechnologies) often face the objection, in both public discourse and in scholarly work, of playing god.
