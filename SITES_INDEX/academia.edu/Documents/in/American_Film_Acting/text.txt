This formulation of the time-image as a response to historical events obscures Deleuze s own insight that the time-image already works within the movement-image. In the pref-ace to the English edition of Cinema 2, Deleuze suggests that we look in silent cinema for a time-image that has always been breaking through, holding back or encompassing the movement-image. 1 Following this second formulation, I argue that a certain kind of time-image precedes and enables the movement-image. I call such image transcendental (in a Kantian sense) because its characteristic forking produces the two poles of the movement-image: the empirical (appearances) and the metaphysical (truth).Save to LibraryDownloadby Agustin Zarzosa•The IrishmanA review of the filmSave to LibraryDownloadby Drew Trotter•  6  Film Studies, Popular Culture, Film Analysis, Popular Culture and Religious StudiesThe Autuerist, Martin ScorseseA student paper written at Anne Arundel Community College From 1974 to the present, Marin Scorsese has made nearly twenty-five theatrical films; films that have been nominated for numerous Academy Awards, over eighty, and even winning... moreA student paper written at Anne Arundel Community CollegeFrom 1974 to the present, Marin Scorsese has made nearly twenty-five theatrical films; films that have been nominated for numerous Academy Awards, over eighty, and even winning twenty. Scorsese's films are not only recognized by the Academy, but by large box office returns, most with his later films, and a deeply-rooted fan base; Scorsese's is able to successfully combine art and wide appeal. Throughout Scorsese's films, there are certain ideas or elements that continue to appear, reflecting his personal directorial style.Save to LibraryDownloadby Hunter Koester•  4  Film Auteurs, Martin Scorsese, Popular Music in Film, Violence in filmStrasberg LegacyMethod acting is a range of training and rehearsal techniques that seek to encourage sincere and emotionally expressive performances, as formulated by several different theatre practitioners including Lee Strasberg, Stella Adler, and... moreMethod acting is a range of training and rehearsal techniques that seek to encourage sincere and emotionally expressive performances, as formulated by several different theatre practitioners including Lee Strasberg, Stella Adler, and Sanford Meisner, while the Organic Creative Process is a conscious, intuitive process that goes beyond it.Save to LibraryDownloadby Giovanni E .

It departs from established academic interpretations that focus on the main protagonist, the former middleweight champion, Jake LaMotta, and his toxic or overtly violent masculinity. Instead, while such interpretations touch upon important aspects of the film, the common claim by philosophy of film scholars that theirs is the only valid reading of Scorsese's work is dubious. Arguing against elitist interpretations that border on calls for prohibition of the film, this contribution presents a new approach to Raging Bull. It is informed by sociological and ethnographic accounts from the US-American boxing milieu in the 20th century. This approach makes it necessary to ground an interpretation of Raging Bull in the actual circumstances of boxing in the United States where two views on the urban gym in social hot spots have been established. Those views are as follows: (i) the gym is perceived as something like a safe space and frontier against the outside world with all its troubles, and (ii) the gym is perceived through the lens of the various ideologies and socioeconomic problems that permeate it on a daily basis and control much of what goes on inside. This sympathetic interpretation is supported by LaMotta's autobiography, which served as a foundation for the film and supports the conclusion that there is a constant dialectical process between Jake's violent behavior and the moral codes he was taught to obey, particularly those relating to the traditional institution of the family, whose rules govern Jake, even in total isolation.Save to LibraryDownloadby Arturo Leyva•Philosophy of Literature and FilmKILLING HISTORY: ON SCORSESE’S “THE IRISHMAN“ (WITH SOME REFLECTION ON TARANTINO’S “ONCE UPON A TIME … IN HOLLYWOOD”)Save to LibraryDownloadby Patrick McGee•  3  Contemporary American Cinema, Quentin Tarantino, Martin ScorseseForeword by Giovanni Morassutti.

While most know Gish as a silent film star, and some know her as an autobiographer and lecturer on the history of early cinema, very few regard her as a film theorist. In this paper, I analyze the theoretical dimension of Gish’s manuscripts, essays, and lecture notes, many of which are unpublished and held in the New York Public Library’s Lillian Gish Papers. In asserting the role of the actor or star as filmic author, Gish speaks directly to abstract questions of art, authorship, and cinema as a ‘universal language.’ Gish’s work engages with the work of such early film theorists Vachel Lindsay, Hugo Munsterberg, and Rudolf Arnheim, as well as that of contemporary scholars of stardom and performance studies. I will conclude my argument by reading the 1927 film The Wind as the culmination of Gish’s philosophies of acting on screen.Save to LibraryDownloadby Annie  Berke•  10  Film Theory and Practice, Film Theory, Silent Film, Gender in FilmScreen Acting and the New Hollywood: An Interview with Ethan Hawke (part 2)Save to LibraryDownloadby Gary Bettinson•  24  Film Theory and Practice, Film Theory, In-depth Interviews, CinemaScreen Acting and the New Hollywood: An Interview with Ethan Hawke (part 1)Save to LibraryDownloadby Gary Bettinson•  27  Film Theory and Practice, Film Theory, In-depth Interviews, American Cinema"The Wolf" in Context [ScottFeinberg.com]Given Martin Scorsese’s recent films, it’s no surprise there was backlash when he released "The Wolf of Wall Street" (2013).

It’s been more than 20 years since the legendary filmmaker pushed the boundaries of the social conscience. Particularly after "Hugo" (2011) won five Academy Awards, the public image of Scorsese has been tempered with that of a straightforward, audience-pleasing director. When he followed up the kid-friendly "Hugo" with the extremely adult "The Wolf of Wall Street," audiences seemed to forget that the latter, not the former, is business as usual for the director.Save to LibraryDownloadby Soren H Hough•  5  Journalism, Film Studies, Film Analysis, Film History2016 Actor Muscle: Craft.
