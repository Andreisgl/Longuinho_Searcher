The Home Office’s Welsh Language Scheme applies to the Home Office in its entirety and all Home Office agencies, and public bodies.
Home Office
The Home Office has adopted the principle that in the conduct of public business in Wales, it will treat the English and Welsh languages on a basis of equality. This scheme sets out how the Home Office, including its listed associated agencies and public bodies, intends to fulfil this commitment when providing services to the public in Wales.
The 
Home Office's Welsh Language Scheme  (PDF, 240 KB, 28 pages) applies to the Home Office in its entirety and all Home Office agencies, and public bodies, unless they run their own Welsh Language Scheme.
The Welsh Language Commissioner approved the revised Home Office Welsh Language Scheme on 26 February 2018.
The Welsh Language Commissioner, Meri Huws, said:
The Home Office has set out to build on the foundations already in place in terms of offering Welsh language services to the people of Wales. I look forward to seeing the scheme being implemented and people having the opportunity to use the Welsh language in their dealings with the Home Office.
