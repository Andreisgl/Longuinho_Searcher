According to the Brazilian Federal Constitution of 1988 and the Statute of the military, the FFAA are for the defense of the country, the guarantee of the constitutional powers and, at the initiative of any of these, of law and order. But the FFAA has been used in security for major sporting events in Brazil as a way to facilitate the implementation of these activities, even when private events linked to FIFA, IOC and ODEPA. The aim of this study was to survey the sports mega-events that happened in Brazil in the last decade (2006-2016) and identify which made use of the FFAA as a key element to provide public security and the realization of events. Methods: The Methodology used was the scenario analysis employed by Mataruna (2006) as a way to assess the environment, the time and the employment situation of crisis management. Results: As a result met the 2007 Pan American Games as the precursor to the use of the FFAA acting together with the auxiliary forces and the newly created National Force. During the 5th Military World Games in 2010, the FFAA were employed in full security, as well as aid to intelligence, with the creation of the Center for Integrated Command and Control (CICC), which was a legacy for the later events such as Cup World Soccer and the Olympic and Paralympic Games. The Navy acted protecting the coast and seas; The Brazilian Air Force in the control and protection of airspace; and the army, control and protection of land borders and also in security areas close to stadiums. Through Intelligence Center, the auxiliary forces had all the support for the security implementation in these mega events by the FFAA. The President of Brazil called the FFAA to act in the security of the Olympic and Paralympic Games Rio 2016 as a way to ensure the event. The armed forces will act directly on the convoy batsmen, safety and protection authorities, and VIP delegations, as well as stadiums, airports and within the city. Conclusions: The use of troops has given more frequently due to avoid problems related to safety and possible inconvenience caused by strike movements of private security companies, as happened in 2010 in South Africa and in 2012 in London in which the FFAA of the respective countries were started up emergency plans. It was also concluded that the Brazilian Armed Forces have important role beyond the defense of the national territory for the realization of sporting events. It was necessary to create language and specific management mechanisms that meet the reality of policy institutions, in this case the IOC and FIFA, the reality of the country and above all, to guarantee a reduction in costs for the organization of the event."Download Free PDFView PDFChallenges for the Brazilian Paralympic Athlete’s CareerSilvestre Neto, Leonardo  MatarunaABSTRACT: “Background: After the creation of the Brazilian Paralympic Committee (BPC) in 1995, the Brazilian Paralympic sport changed the management system betting in athletes results. The new committee converted the rehabilitation programmes and sports participation for sports performance. This structuring process was fundamental to the Paralympic sport a career. The funds, seen as the gateway to the beginning of sports career, need other media (environmental, structural and emotional) to boost the achievement of significant sporting results. Methods: This is an exploratory literature review using national References obtained through the Portal CAPES, Scielo, database library of the School of Physical Education from UFRGS and institutional documents of the BPC and the Ministry of Sports, responsible entities for the development of brazilian paralympic sport. Results: During the years 1972 to 2012 the country participated in 10 editions and won 229 medals (73 gold, 83 silver and 73 bronze) by 127 athletes (80% male and 20% female). The events: Athletics (31%), Swimming (21%), Football 5-a-side (13%), Football 7-a-side (13%), Judo (8%) and Goalball (5%) concentrate most medals won. In relation to public policies of incentive to sport Agnelo/Piva Law n. 10.264/2001, the implementation of the Bolsa Atleta program by the Sports Ministry in 2004 and the Sport Incentive Law n. 11, 438/2006 made possible the obtaining of large results by Paralympians. Conclusions:. Two recent actions, the alteration in the percentage of transfer of federal lotteries (15% to 37.04%) and the construction of the Paralympic Training Center, reinforce the concern of the BPC and the Ministry of Sports in keeping the excellent sporting results obtained in recent years and to seek the goal to be among on the top five medalists in the medals table at the Paralympic Games Rio 2016. Still is necessary actions to promote a greater number of paralympic athletes in different regions of the country and expand the opportunities for the formation of new sports talents. Therefore, create awareness in the private sector (96% of resources are government); establish partnerships with higher education institutions (renewal of human resources and sports structure); and Military Institutions (structural conditions) seem to be essential actions to maintain the positive results and also to come new triumphs for the Brazilian paralympic sport."Download Free PDFView PDFIV NSCA INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE SPAIN 2014João Vilas-boas, Ana Silva, Piyaporn Tumnark, Ricardo FernandesDownload Free PDFView PDFPreliminary analysis of the genofit genomics of health and fitness studyAnthony W RyanINTRODUCTION: Health, fitness and well-being are influenced by both environmental and genetic components. By integrating genomic and phenotypic data, the GenoFit study aims to identify genetic variants that contribute to various aspects of human health and fitness. METHODS: Participants (age range 18 – 89 years) complete a detailed lifestyle questionnaire and are physically assessed for general health and fitness measures including adiposity, blood pressure, heart rate, bone mineral density and muscle health. The genomes of all enrolled individuals will be whole genome sequenced to a depth of 30x and genotyped using an Affymetrix precision medicine research array containing over 800,000 markers. The final target sample size is 5,000 individuals. RESULTS: To date, 277 individuals have been genotyped. Analysis using linear regression for quantitative trait association (PLINK v1.9) have yielded nominally significant (uncorrected P {\textless} 0.05) association signals for several traits including adiposity, hand-grip and bone density. However, with the current sample size, no loci have reached genome-wide significance. CONCLUSION: Active sample collection, phenotypic characterization and molecular analysis are ongoing, with the aim of developing a valuable resource for future genomic studies.Download Free PDFView PDFThe effects of dehydration on tennis performance in a temperate environmentKatharina TilgnerThere seems to be discrepancies when addressing hydration and its effect on performance. Marathon runners compete successfully despite being dehydrated (6% body mass loss) and having high rectal temperature, weight loss, and sweat rate (Pugh et al. 1967: Journal of Applied Physiology, 23, 347-352). However, it has been suggested that tennis players need to minimise fluid loss (Bergeron et al. 1995: Clinical Sports Medicine, 14, 23-32). Hence this pilot study investigated the effects of dehydration on tennis performance. The study was approved by the University ethics committee. Participants were three male tennis players from a local tennis academy (age 17 ± 1 years, height 180 ± 9 cm, body mass 77 ± 11 kg) who undertook a habituation session prior to experimental testing and then completed two main trials, seven days apart, using a randomised cross-over design. Each trial comprised a forced dehydration protocol – 60 min walking and jogging in an environmental chamber (air temperatu...Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
