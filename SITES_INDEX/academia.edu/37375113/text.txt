Maas, Karin Preisendanz (eds.) Yoga in Transformation: Historical and Contemporary Perspectives. Wiener Forum für Theologie und Religionswissenschaft,16. Vienna: Vienna University Press by V&R unipressIn this chapter the thematic focus shifts from the description and analysis of yoga in individual religious and philosophical traditions of premodern South Asia to the cultural transfer of yoga from South Asia to the Arab intellectual world in the Middle Ages. After providing an introduction to the life and work of al-Bīrūnī, the famous Perso-Muslim polymath who lived at the turn of the first millennium CE and spent some years in north-western South Asia, it surveys previous scholarly attempts to identify the Sanskrit source of his Kitāb Pātanğal, an Arab rendering of a yoga work in the tradition of Patañjali. The two authors arrive at the novel hypothesis that al-Bīrūnī may have used the Pātañjalayogaśāstra (i. e., the Yogasuūtra together with the so-called Yogabhāṣya) as the main source of the Kitāb Pātanğal. This finding provides the basis for a new assessment of this work as the result of different literary transformations, some of which necessarily had to be highly creative in order to transfer the philosophical and religious content of a Sanskrit yoga work of the late fourth or early fifth century into the intellectual culture of medieval Islam. Taking into consideration these creative aspects of the Kitāb Pātanğal, Maas and Verdon demonstrate that the aspiration of the Perso-Muslim author was not merely to provide a translation faithful to the wording of its source text, but to make the spiritual dimension of yoga accessible to his Muslim readership.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersAndrey Safronov.

In these passages, the scholar applied a specific terminology belonging to Islamic philosophy and indebted to Aristotle in order to express technical Sāṅkhya and Yoga concepts. His choices of interpretation are rooted in his intellectual background, such as the Falsafa terminology which he used was part of a shared knowledge among Muslim thinkers of his time. This article provides with a comparative analysis of the Arabic translated terms of the Sanskrit original concepts. It discusses the manner in which al-Bīrūnī interpreted these concepts and the possible reasons which led him to make these interpretive choices. Lastly, it highlights the necessity of examining al-Bīrūnī's transmission of Indian thought by way of his intellectual background.Download Free PDFView PDFYoga in Transformation: Historical and Contemporary Perspectives. Vienna University Press.The Proliferation of Āsana-s in Late-Mediaeval Yoga Texts2018 • Jason BirchThe writing of this paper was prompted by the discovery of several manuscripts of mediaeval yoga texts which contain lists of more than eighty-four āsana-s, a canonical number mentioned in several yoga texts. Until now, lists of eighty-four āsana-s have been found in only two recently published yoga texts, namely, the Haṭharatnāvalī and the Jogapradīpyakā. The manuscript evidence presented in this article indicates that these published texts are not isolated accounts of mediaeval yoga systems with many complex āsanas. In fact, it is clear that more than eighty-four āsana-s were practised in some traditions of Haṭha Yoga before the British arrived in India. The majority of these āsana-s were not seated poses, but complex and physically-demanding postures, some of which involved repetitive movement, breath control and the use of ropes. When the āsana-s in the sources which I shall analyse in this article are considered in their totality, antecedents can be identified for many non-seated and inverted postures in twentieth-century systems of Indian yoga.Download Free PDFView PDFInternational Journal of Hindu StudiesContextualizing the History of Yoga in Geoffrey Samuel’s The Origins of Yoga and Tantra: A Review Symposium2011 • Stuart Ray  SarbackerDownload Free PDFView PDFYoga in Asia – Mimetic History:  Problems in the Location of Secret Knowledge.

This chapter provides a brief historical overview with an emphasis on Muslim communities in South Asia, especially during the Mughal period. This first part of the chapter establishes the basic framework for understanding the earliest surviving texts demonstrating Muslim engagement with yoga in South Asia, as well as the most important texts and individuals who stand out as key examples of how this engagement develops over subsequent centuries. This chapter also pays special attention to the translation and circulation of a set of Śaivite divination techniques centred on the breath known as Śiva-svarodaya (sometimes svara-yoga or svara-jñāna) from Sanskrit and Hindi into Persian and Arabic as `ilm-i dam/`ilm al-dam (‘the science of the breath’).1 The second part examines meditation, with an emphasis on the Sufi rituals known as dhikr, the ‘remembrance’ of God. The third section analyses contemporary concerns and controversies regarding Muslims and yoga.Download Free PDFView PDF2012. Yogasūtra 1.10, 1.21–23, and 2.9 in the Light of the Indo-Javanese Dharma PātañjalaAndrea AcriThis paper discusses a series of sūtras of Patañjali’s Yogasūtra, namely 1.10, 1.21–23, and 2.9, in the light of their paraphrase and/or interpretation found in the Dharma Pātañjala (‘Book/System of Patañjali’), an Old Javanese-Sanskrit Śaiva scripture retrieved from a rare West Javanese codex unicus dated ca. 1450 AD. Besides a philosophical exposition of the tenets of a form of Śaiva Siddhānta, the Dharma Pātañjala contains a long presentation of the yoga system that apparently follows the first three chapters of Patañjal’s Yogasūtra, either interweaving Sanskrit excerpts from an untraced versified version of the latter text with an Old Javanese commentary, or directly rendering into Old Javanese what appears to be an original Sanskrit commentary. Although the Old Javanese prose often bears a strong resemblance with the arrangement and formulation of the topics treated in the Yogasūtrabhāṣya, it diverges from that commentary in several respects. The Dharma Pātañjala often presents specific doctrinal details that are found in other (sub)commentaries or in the Arabic rendering of the sūtras-cum-commentary composed by al-Bīrūnī before 1030 AD, or adds original elements that are unattested elsewhere. The testimony of the Dharma Pātañjala turns out to be useful in order to solve some of the dilemmas posed by the selected sūtras. It may also help us to better understand the textual cultural transmission and cultural reception of Patañjali’s work in both South and Southeast Asia, for its author, rather than freely borrowing from different Sanskrit commentaries, appear to have drawn upon an as yet unidentified, and possibly lost, ‘common source’.Download Free PDFView PDFDisentangling the Persian Translations of Sanskrit Works on YogaCarl ErnstDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
