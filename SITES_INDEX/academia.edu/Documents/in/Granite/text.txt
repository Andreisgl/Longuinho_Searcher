However, in special concrete such as High Strength Concrete (HSC) and High Performance Concrete (HPC) where, the water/cement ratio is low and high content of cement constitute their characteristics, the bulk compressive load is borne by the aggregate. Therefore, the failure in such concrete is mostly through the aggregate. This study discussed the characteristics of different type of coarse aggregate with distinct size range, 20-14mm and 10-5mm on properties of high performance concrete. In this project, investigation such as Slump test and Unit weight were carried out on fresh properties, and also compressive strength and water absorption on hardened properties, in which, readings were taken at curing days of 7 days, 14 days, and 28 days.

It is expected that this is particularly the case for inland high-altitude regions. We hypothesized that the bedrock type and the presence of macrobiota in these soils enforce a high selective pressure on their bacterial communities. To test this, we analyzed the bacterial community structure in 52 soil samples from the western Sør Rondane Mountains (Dronning Maud Land, East Antarctica), using the Illumina MiSeq platform in combination with ARISA fingerprinting. The samples were taken along broad environmental gradients in an area covering nearly 1000 km(2) Ordination and variation partitioning analyses revealed that the total organic carbon content was the most significant variable in structuring the bacterial communities, followed by pH, electric conductivity, bedrock type and the moisture content, while spatial distance was of relatively minor importance.

It is an elliptical body with 10 discontinuous ring-shaped outcrops due to later faulting. Field relationships enable the 11 recognition of two main phases of magmatic activity in the ARC. The early phase represents the 12 core of the intrusion (monzogranite, syenogranite, granophyre, and alkali feldspar granite) 13 surrounded by the last phase (alkali volcanics and alkaline/peralkaline granites). The contacts 14 between two phases are gradational and/or sharp, indicating their emplacement within a very 15 short time period before the complete crystallization of the earlier phase. The ARC is alkaline to 16 peralkaline rare-metal granites with the common geochemical characteristics of post-collisional 17 intraplate A-type rocks. The pronounced negative Eu anomalies (Eu/Eu* = 0.14–0.25) reflect 18 extreme magmatic fractionation an...Save to LibraryDownloadby Bassam Abuamarah•Diamond wire – stone interaction during the cutting process: mechanical, physical and chemical investigationsStone cutting with diamond wires results in the progressive and concurrent wear of the natural stone and the cutting tool (diamond wires - diamond beads).

This phenomenon has been investigated since the beginning of stone machining, but there are still several open questions concerning the parameters controlling it. The aim of this study is to establish correlations between the natural stone mineralogical composition and the diamond wires cut performance in terms of efficiency, productivity and diamond beads consumption. This investigation requires a multidisciplinary approach. Microscopic analysis have been done in order to investigate the wear processes of the diamond beads in terms of super-abrasive grains (diamond grits) damage and pull out.

Based on their far-flung findspot, some have suggested that the stelae were locally made by Egyptian colonists who had settled on the island during the second millennium bc. This contribution argues that the stelae offer no basis for such historical reconstructions. Style, content and petrology demonstrate that all four stelae were made in Egypt and that they originally stood in the necropolis of Abydos in Upper Egypt. Microfossils show that these stelae are made of Egyptian limestones, which are of a different geological age to limestones available on Malta. The examination of polished thin sections of samples from the stelae using scanning electron microscopy suggests that the limestones employed were quarried from four geological formations of different ages in the Nile Valley.Save to LibraryDownloadby Marcel Maree•Deep drill hole in the Devonian South Mountain batholith, Nova Scotia: a potential for hidden mineral deposits within the batholithThe drill hole near Digby in southwestern Nova Scotia is the deepest on-shore hole in the Canadian Appalachians, and penetrated to a depth of about 1.5 km.

The site of the drill was selected at the periphery of the Devonian South Mountain batholith, which contains important mineralization of tin and uranium. The drill hole intersected texturally uniform megacrystic biotite granodiorite, which does not display any pronounced primary vertical zonation. At depth, the drill core contains zones of alteration, fracturing, and brecciation. The alteration is mainly due to fluid flow along the fractures. Some fractures are mineralized and contain galena, sphalerite, pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite, pyrite, hematite, quartz, and carbonate minerals. Common occurrence of alteration zones in the hole suggests that such zones are widespread in the batholith and point to abundant hydrothermal activity deep within the massif.

To test this 10Be-SH calibration curve, 100 surfaces were sampled from five ice-front positions in the Têt catchment, eastern Pyrenees, with results verified against independent 10Be and 14C ages. Gaussian modelling differentiates Holocene (9.4±0.6 ka), Younger Dryas (12.6±0.9 ka), Oldest Dryas (16.1±0.5 ka), last glacial maximum (LGM; 24.8±0.9 ka) and Würmian maximum ice extent stages (MIE; 40.9±1.1 ka). These data confirm comparable glacier lengths during the LGM and MIE (~300 m difference), in contrast to evidence from the western Pyrenees (≥15 km), reflecting the relative influence of Atlantic and Mediterranean climates. Moreover, Pyrenean glaciers advanced significantly during the LGM, with a local maximum at ~25 ka, driven by growth of the L...Save to LibraryDownloadby Raimon Pallàs Serra•  11  Archaeology, Geology, Quaternary, PyreneesGreen Chitosan:Thiourea Dioxide Cleaning Gel for Manganese Stains on Granite and Glass SubstratesThe cleaning or removal of manganese stains on Cultural Heritage has not been much tested or successful so far.

It is possible to establish a relationship between the evolution of the ultrasound waves velocity (Vp) with the number of freeze-thaw cycles and the generation of microcracks. Intergranular cracks are formed during the first cycles and these propagate towards the inner part of each individual crystals as the freeze-thaw cycles advance. Therefore, after 280 freeze-thaw cycles different patterns of microcracking can be observed depending on the mineralogy. Quartz is the mineral displaying more intense cracking while biotite shows less cracking, in part due to its more ductile behaviour. Micro-cracks appear preferentially at the surface of the samples with a maximum length and depth of 1 cm. Thus, these samples showed limited decay highlighting the good performance of Cadalso de los Vidrios granite against ...Save to LibraryDownloadby David M .

Feldspars are an important component of granites, which are susceptible to microcracking, which causes the disintegration of these crystals. Microcracks generated in feldspars during thermal processes such as freeze-thaw and thermal shock were studied to understand the decay process of granite buildings due to weathering. Using petrographic study techniques of optical microscopy and fluorescence, microcracks propagation (inter- and intracrystalline) was studied in feldspars (potassium feldspars and plagioclases) of two widely used building heritage granites. Potassium feldspars and plagioclases developed different mechanisms of microcracking due their microstructures.

The region’s quarrying towns preserve their granite extraction and hewing traditions. Historic quarries form part of the landscape, as do current extraction sites with huge reserves that guarantee a speedy supply of variously finished dimension stone. Piedra Berroqueña granite has been in use as a construction material since long before Roman times. Many important monuments, including San Lorenzo Royal Monastery at El Escorial (1563−1584), Madrid’s Royal Palace (1738−1764), the Alcalá Gate (1770−1778), the Prado Museum (1785−1808) and Puerta del Sol (one of Madrid’s main squares), owe their good state of preservation to the stone’s petrophysical characteristics and durability.

Masonry buildings can be found all over the world, built with a wide diversity of materials and serving for all kind of purposes. In rural northwestern Portugal, in a granitic highland landscape of scarce resources, for centuries, local farmers used masonry in order to make the territory suitable for farming. In their effort to increase production and, by doing so, to improve their living conditions, a specific mountain agro-pastoral system was developed. Supported by communitarian labour, this system was based on terrace farming and temporary mountain plateau settlements, called brandas, composed of granite corbelled dome buildings. In spite of its perfect adaptation to the harsh local conditions, this heritage’s morphological and typological diversity and constructive inventiveness is endangered due to decades of rural exodus and, thus requiring urgent study an...Save to LibraryDownloadby Luis Ramos•Sistemas de extracción como técnicas constructivas para evitar la entrada de gas radón en las viviendasSave to LibraryDownloadby Borja Frutos•  7  Environmental Science, Radon, Efectividad, Energy EficiencyAssessment of stone heritage decay by X-ray computed microtomography: I - a case study of Portuguese Braga graniteSave to LibraryDownloadby Antonio Miranda•  5  Materials Engineering, Geology, Condensed Matter Physics, PortugueseFeasibility study of using poplar wastes as sand in cement mortarsSave to LibraryDownloadby Hassina Kada•  4  Environmental Engineering, Materials Science, Cement, MortarDevelopment of Multifunctional Coatings for Protecting Stones and Lime Mortars of the Architectural HeritageSave to LibraryDownloadby tania mateo•  15  Engineering, Architecture, Architectural Heritage, PhotocatalystInvestigation of Environmentally Driven Deterioration of Diorite Statues in Mut Temple, Egypt and Concepts for ConservationMut temple is located at the south of the great temple of Karnak.

Most of parts at this temple belonged to the king Amenhotep III, who furnished it with hundreds of statues of the goddess Mut in her leonine shape of Sekhmet. Amenhotep set up these statues in diorite which had been used in many important ancient Egyptian monuments during the heights of ancient Egyptian civilization. These diorite statues were subjected to different kinds of physical, chemical and biological alteration as a consequence of their exposure to the direct action of aggressive atmospheric agents (temperature, humidity, wind, chemical weathering and salts pressure) so, They suffer from different deterioration phenomena such as missing parts, erosion of stone, presence of cracks and micro cracks, disintegration of some parts, crystallization of salts and dirt.
