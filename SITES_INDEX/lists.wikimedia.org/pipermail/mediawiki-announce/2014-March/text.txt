Hello everyone,

I am happy  to announce the release of MediaWiki 1.22.5, 1.21.8 and 1.19.14. These are
regular security and maintenance releases. Download links are given at the end of this
email.

== Security ==
* (bug 62497) SECURITY: Add CSRF token on Special:ChangePassword.

== Fixes made in all tarballs ==
* (bug 62467) Set a title for the context during import on the cli.

== Bugfixes in 1.22.5 ==
* Fix custom local MediaWiki:Help values.
* mediawiki.js: Fix documentation breakage.
* (bug 58153) Make MySQLi work with non standard port.
* (bug 53887) Reintroduced a link to help pages in the default sidebar, that
  any sysop can customize by editing [[MediaWiki:Sidebar]] locally. The link
  now points to a mediawiki.org page which is guaranteed to exist. Nothing needs
  to be done on your end, but remember to adjust [[MediaWiki:Sidebar]] for the
  needs of your wikis. Everyone can help with the shared documentation by
  translating: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Special:Translate/agg-Help_pages .
* (bug 53888) Corrected a regression in 1.22 which introduced red links on the
  login page. If you previously installed 1.22.x and have created a local page
  to make the red link blue, write its title as in [[MediaWiki:helplogin-url]]
  if you didn't already. Otherwise, you don't need to do anything, but you can
  translate the help page at https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Logging_in .
