In some cases, parents are relying on their children to help them fill in forms and attend medical appointments.Funding for English language classes has halved in the last decade - dropping £100m a year - according to figures from the Association of Colleges. Its head, David Hughes, says this means "hundreds of thousands of people missing out on being integrated into society", while Dame Louise Casey, who wrote an integration review in 2016, says cuts are a "mistake" and the Far Right aims to target issues like language "to sow division".The government says it recognises the "pressures" on colleges and will review funding in the next Spending Review.It has also allocated funding to five areas identified as needing extra support to help migrants integrate. The BBC visited one of them - Peterborough - to find out about the challenges of translation.SubsectionUKPublished23 April 2019Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRead descriptionExplore moreThe teenagers who translate for their parents.
