Extraction of the freeze-dried and pulverized fruiting bodies and mycelia with methanol and water (8:2, v/v), followed by evaporation of the solvent under a vacuum, created their extracts, which were analyzed for their AOXC and TPC using a DPPH· scavenging assay and the Folin-Ciocalteu method, respectively. The fruiting bodies and the culture mycelia of all the mushroom species exhibited varied antioxidant capacity; however, the fruiting bodies had more ...See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersIMTIAZ PAPERKEERTI DEHARIYADownload Free PDFView PDFProximate composition and antioxidant activity of Panaeolus antillarium, a wild coprophilous mushroomRich Milton R DulayPanaeolus antillarium remains to be underutilized mycological resource in the Philippines. Thus, this present work established the nutraceutical and funtional attributes of this coprophilous mushroom. The mycochemical and proximate nutrient composition were analyzed and its antioxidant activity as affected by the different media and pH levels was studied. Radical scavenging activity and total phenolic content were used as parameters for antioxidant property. Extracts of P. antillarium contained appreciable amounts of alkaloids, saponins, and cardiac glycosides. Nutrient composition analysis revealed that mycelia had higher amounts of crude fiber (7.05 ± 0.04), crude fat (1.96 ± 0.06), moisture (11.85 ± 0.01) and total carbohydrate (61.12 ± 0.01) than its corresponding fruiting bodies. On the other hand, the fruiting bodies had higher amounts of ash (5.26 ± 0.03), crude protein (16.77 ± 0.01), and energy value (321.49 ± 0.04) than its mycelia. Potato broth significantly had the highest mean volume loss (14.5 ± 2.50 ml), mycelia weight (4.5 ± 0.65 g), scavenging activity (16.06 ± 0.51%) and phenolic content (25.07 ± 0.02 mg AAE/g sample). However, varying pH levels of potato broth did not significantly affect the mycelial growth, but pH 7.0 recorded the highest scavenging activity (17.39 ± 0.19%) and total phenolic content (25.11 ± 0.01 mg AAE/g sample). Herein, these significant data suggest that P. antillarium is another potential source of substances and nutrients with functional attributes such as antioxidant which strongly infuenced by different media and pH levels.Download Free PDFView PDFThe edible mushroom Laetiporus sulphureus as potential source of natural antioxidantsMiomir NiksicHot water extract (LN), partially purified polysaccharides (LP) and hot alkali extracted polysaccharides (LNa) obtained from fruiting bodies of the wild basidiomycete Laetiporus sulphureus were examined for their antioxidant activities. LNa was the most active antioxidant, as shown by the median effective concentrations (EC 50 values) of 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging activity (0.5 ^ 0.2 mg/ml), reducing power (4.0 ^ 0.3 mg/ml) and ferrous ion-chelating ability (1.5 ^ 0.1 mg/ml). LNa contained the highest level of a-glucan (17.3 ^ 1.2 g/100 g dw), whereas LP contained mostly b-glucans (66.8 ^ 1.3 g/100 g dw). The prevalent monosaccharide in all extracts was glucose. The EC 50 values of all three antioxidant activity assays were well-correlated with the a-glucan content. Strong and significant correlation was found between total phenolic compounds and DPPH scavenging ability and also reducing power. The three investigated extracts (at concentrations of 0.1– 10 mg/ml)...Download Free PDFView PDFReview Alves et al.

Singer (1951) is a unique sclerotium-forming edible and medicinal mushroom. Interestingly, both the sclerotium and mushroom are edible and are often used for curing various ailments. Previous studies have focused on the antimicrobial and antioxidant activity of the extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) from wild P. tuber-regium. There has been no report on the intracellular polysaccharide (IPS) of the wild mycelia, likewise there is very meager information on the improvement of the perceived potentials of P. tuber-regium. This research study analysed the EPS and IPS fractions of P. tuber-regium hybrid and mutant strains. The antimicrobial potential of the IPS and EPS fractions, their scavenging activity on 1, 1-diphenyl-2picryhydrazyl (DPPH) and Hydroxyl radicals were also determined. Both IPS and EPS fractions of P. tuber-regium hybrids and mutants showed increased DPPH and hydroxyl scavenging activity over the wild P. tuber-regium with an EC 50 mostly < 1 mg/ml. The antimicrobial activity of the IPS from a mutant strain had an IC 50 of 15.6 mg/ml compared to the wild type (18.75 mg /ml). This study showed that selected mutant and hybrids of P. tuber-regium had increased radical scavenging activity indicating potentially increased biological activity that could offer increased benefit as a neutraceutical.Download Free PDFView PDFLWT - Food Science and TechnologyBioactives of fruiting bodies and submerged culture mycelia of Agaricus brasiliensis (A. blazei) and their antioxidant properties2012 • Gabrielle ElerDownload Free PDFView PDF1324561208-Khatunetal 2011AJEA492Yuvraj RathoreDownload Free PDFView PDFInternational Journal of Medicinal MushroomsSubmerged Culture of Grifola gargal and G. sordulenta (Higher Basidiomycetes) from Argentina as a Source of Mycelia with Antioxidant Activity2015 • Nestor CurvettoDownload Free PDFView PDFPhenolic content and antioxidant activity of selected wild mushrooms from Tricholomataceae family, collected in MacedoniaKaterina  Rusevska, Oliver TusevskiMacrofungi have long been valued as nutritional food and an important part of the traditional medicine by different cultures worldwide. They contain large number of secondary metabolites which have antioxidant properties. Phenolic compounds are widely distributed secondary metabolites in mushrooms, that are correlated with their antioxidant activity. The aim of this study was to investigate the content of phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity of three wild species belonging to two genera of Tricholomataceae family: Collybia peronata, Tricholoma aurantium and T. stans. Antioxidant properties of the selected fungi were assayed using DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) radical scavenging capacity method. Total phenolic content in the methanolic extract of the mature fruiting bodies was determined by Folin-Ciocalteu's colorimetric method, while for the determination of the flavonoid content was used aluminium chloride colorimetric method. The highest content of total phenolic compounds was found in Tricholoma stans (19.43±0.70 mg GAE/g DW), followed by T. aurantium and Collybia peronata (15.93±0.58 and 10.60±0.26 mg GAE/g DW, respectively). The highest flavonoid content was also determined for the extract of T. stans (3,47±0.18 mg QE/g). Among the tested samples, T. aurantium fruiting body extract was the strongest DPPH scavenger with the lowest EC 50 value (0.30), followed by the extracts of T. stans and C. peronata (0.32 and 0.61, respectively). This study demonstrated that the analysed wild macrofungi (Collybia peronata, Tricholoma aurantium and T. stans) have the potential to accumulate phenolics as bioactive secondary metabolites that possess antioxidant activity .Download Free PDFView PDFHemijska industrijaPolysaccharides of higher fungi: Biological role, structure, and antioxidative activity2014 • Miomir NiksicDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
