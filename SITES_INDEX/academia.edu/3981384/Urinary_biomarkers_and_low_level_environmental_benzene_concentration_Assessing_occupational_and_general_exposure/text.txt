The aim of this study was to evaluate the specificity of unmetabolized benzene excreted in urine (UBz) and S-phenylmercapturic acid (SPMA) as biomarkers of exposure to very low levels of benzene, and to study the impact of putative individual confounders like smoking and alcohol habits, co-exposure to other toxicants and body mass index on the exposure assessment. Environmental and biological monitoring of exposure to benzene were performed in 114 Urban Policemen. The mean value of UBz in non-smokers was significantly lower than in either groups of light to moderate smokers and heavy smokers (0.24, 1.82 and 2.82 μg L−1, respectively). On the contrary, SPMA values did not discriminate exposure resulting from smoking habits. Moreover, the concentration of UBz in non-smokers appears to be correlated with environmental benzene concentration (BenzA) (R2 = 0.13, β = 0.37, p = 0.002). On the other hand, no significant correlation was found between SPMA concentration (corrected for creatinine excretion and log transformed, LogSPMA) and LogBenzA (R2 = 0.003, β = 0.05, p = 0.6). Our findings reinforce previous research on the use of unmetabolized urinary benzene as a specific and sensitive biomarker of low-level exposure to benzene and confirm that smoking habits strongly influence the excretion of UBz.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersInternational Archives of Occupational and Environmental HealthAnalysis of potential influence factors on background urinary benzene concentration among a non-smoking, non-occupationally exposed general population sample2013 • Silvia  FustinoniDownload Free PDFView PDFAir Quality-Models and ApplicationsAssessment of Environmental Exposure to Benzene: Traditional and New Biomarkers of Internal Dose2011 • Piero LovreglioDownload Free PDFView PDFBiomarkersA quantitative approach to evaluate urinary benzene and S-phenylmercapturic acid as biomarkers of low benzene exposure2011 • Silvia  FustinoniDownload Free PDFView PDFMutation Research/Genetic Toxicology and Environmental MutagenesisEvaluation of chromosome aberration and micronucleus frequencies in blood lymphocytes of workers exposed to low concentrations of benzene2014 • Patrizia  Hrelia, F.
