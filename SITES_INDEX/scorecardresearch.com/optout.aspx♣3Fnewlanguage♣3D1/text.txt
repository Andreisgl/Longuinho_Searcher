You can control your level of participation in ScorecardResearch’s market research programs, along with other research programs that are operated by Full Circle Studies, Inc., or its affiliates.

To opt-out of having ScorecardResearch’s market research programs associated with your browser, please click here. We will continue to count the fact that a browser came to a site, but that count will not be associated with your browser.

This opt-out will also prevent you from receiving invitations to participate in market research surveys from ScorecardResearch or VoiceFive, Inc. (an affiliate of Full Circle Studies, Inc., that offers surveys across the Internet).  However, it is important that you understand that this opt-out is cookie based (i.e., a cookie must be on your computer to tell our systems that you have opted-out).  So, if you delete, block or otherwise restrict cookies, this opt-out may not be effective.  Additionally, because different computers and different Internet browsers all require their own version of the opt-out cookie, you need to perform this opt-out process on any computers and browsers that you want to be opted-out.
