Using a scoping review methodology, a systematic search for studies reporting outcomes in children and adolescents with chronic pain over a ≥12 month period was undertaken. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they included children and adolescents (≤18 years old on study enrolment) with chronic pain, and outcomes were followed up for ≥12 months. Overall, 42 studies investigating more than 24,132 children were included in the review. Studies assessed a total of 187 unique outcome measures within the broader measures of pain (38 studies; 90%), function (33 studies; 79%) and other (21 studies; 50%). Unidimensional assessments of the severity or presence of pain and global assessments of function were the most commonly reported outcome measures.

The aim of the study was to establish the feasibility of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) examining the effectiveness of normal saline instillation (NSI) and a positive end-expiratory pressure recruitment manoeuvre (RM) with endotracheal suction in the paediatric intensive care unit. METHODS Pilot 2 × 2 factorial RCT. The study was conducted at a 36-bed tertiary paediatric intensive care unit in Australia. Fifty-eight children aged less than 16 years undergoing tracheal intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation. (i) NSI or no NSI and (ii) RM or no RM with endotracheal suction . The primary outcome was feasibility; secondary outcomes were ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), change in end-expiratory lung volume assessed by electrical impedance tomography, dynamic compliance, and oxygen saturation-to-fraction of inspired oxygen (SpO2/FiO2) ratio. RESULTS/FINDINGS Recruitment, retention, and missing data feasibility criteria were achieved. Eligibility and protocol adherence criteria were not achieved, with 818 patients eligible and 58 enrolled; cardiac surgery was the primary reason for exclusion. Approximately 30% of patients had at least one episode of nonadherence. Children who received NSI had a reduced incidence of VAP; however, this did not reach statistical significance (incidence rate ratio = 0.12, 95% confidence interval = 0.01-1.10; p = 0.06). NSI was associated with a significantly reduced SpO2/FiO2 ratio up to 10 min after suction. RMs were not associated with a reduced VAP incidence (incidence rate ratio = 0.31, 95% confidence interval = 0.05-1.88), but did significantly improve end-expiratory lung volume at 2 and 5 min after suction, dynamic compliance, and SpO2/FiO2 ratio. CONCLUSION RMs provided short-term improvements in end-expiratory lung volume and oxygenation. NSI with suction led to a reduced incidence of VAP; however, a definitive RCT is needed to test statistical differences. A RCT of study interventions is worthwhile and may be feasible with protocol modifications including the widening of participant eligibility.Save to Libraryby Karina R Charles•NursingRecommendations for endotracheal suction interventions in children with highly infectious respiratory disease: Results from a RAND/UCLA binational appropriateness panelSave to Libraryby Karina R Charles•Appropriate use criteria for endotracheal suction interventions in mechanically ventilated children: The RAND/UCLA development processSave to Libraryby Karina R Charles•NursingThe Paediatric AirWay Suction (PAWS) appropriateness guide for endotracheal suction interventionsEndotracheal suction is an invasive and potentially harmful technique used for airway clearance in mechanically ventilated children.

Choice of suction intervention remains a complex and variable process. We sought to develop appropriate use criteria for endotracheal suction interventions used in paediatric populations. The RAND Corporation and University of California, Los Angeles Appropriateness Method was used to develop the Paediatric AirWay Suction appropriateness guide. This included defining key terms, synthesising current evidence, engaging an expert multidisciplinary panel, case scenario development, and two rounds of appropriateness ratings (weighing harm with benefit). Indications (clinical scenarios) were developed from common applications or anticipated use, current practice guidelines, clinical trial results, and expert consultation. Overall, 148 (19%) scenarios were rated as appropriate (benefit outweighs harm), 542 (67%) as uncertain, and 94 (11%) as inappropriate (harm outweighs benefit). Disagreement occurred in 24 (3%) clinical scenarios, namely presuction and postsuction bagging across populations and age groups. In general, the use of closed suction was rated as appropriate, particularly in the subspecialty population &#39;patients with highly infectious respiratory disease&#39;. Routine application of 0.9% saline for nonrespiratory indications was more likely to be inappropriate/uncertain than appropriate. Panellists preferred clinically indicated suction versus routine suction in most circumstances. Appropriate use criteria for endotracheal suction in the paediatric intensive care have the potential to impact clinical decision-making, reduce practice variability, and improve patient outcomes. Furthermore, recognition of uncertain clinical scenarios facilitates identification of areas that would benefit from future research.Save to Libraryby Karina R Charles and +1Jessica Schults•ElsevierMethodology minute: Utilising the RAND/UCLA appropriateness method to develop guidelines for infection preventionThe use of the RAND/UCLA appropriateness method is an innovative way to provide practical, evidence based clinical guidance to infection preventionist (IP) in the absence of clinical trial data.

Methods Mixed methods underpinned by literature and co-production principles. Iterative development of the instrument was informed through semi-structured interviews and stakeholder workshops. The instrument includes a risk assessment, inserter skill self-assessment, and escalation pathways. Reproducibility, reliability, and acceptability were evaluated in a prospective cohort study at a quaternary paediatric hospital in Australia. Results Interview data (three parents, nine clinicians) uncovered two themes: i) Recognition of children with DIVA and subsequent escalation is ad hoc and problematic; and ii) Resources and training impact inserter confidence and ability.

Colonised intravenous fluids are one potential source of infection; however, there is little published literature on incidence rates and few recent studies. Routine intravenous fluid replacement has been advocated as an infection control method, but the effectiveness of this is unknown and the optimal duration for infusate use remains uncertain.DESIGN: Cross-sectional study over 18 months in a 257-bed teaching hospital.METHODS: Infusate specimens (n = 264) were obtained from crystalloid fluids that had been used for 24 hours or more. Microbiological culture and sensitivity testing was performed and infusate-related bloodstream infection (IRBSI) rates were recorded. Sample testing of previously unopened intravenous solutions acted as a control.RESULTS: The infusate colonisation rate was 0.4%, or 0.09 per 1000 infusion hours. The only isolated organism was coagulase-negative Staphylococcus. Infusions had been in use for 24-185 hours (1-8 days). There was no difference in median duration of use for colonised (35.0 hours) and sterile (34.0 hours) specimens (Mann-Whitney test, p = 0.99). There were no cases of IRBSI.CONCLUSION: The incidence of intravenous fluid colonisation and the risk of related bloodstream infection are low even after several days of infusate use. Current practice appears to successfully maintain the sterility of intravenous fluids.RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Routine replacement of intravenous fluids continues in many settings, often 24 hourly, in the belief that this prevents infection. We found no relationship between duration of use and colonisation and routine replacement may be unnecessary. Further research is needed to investigate the effectiveness of routinely replacing intravenous fluids at set time points to prevent colonisation and infection.Save to Libraryby Gillian Ray-Barruel and +1Matthew McGrail•  2  Infection Control, Intravascular devicesThe easy option?

This article seeks to contribute to the knowledge on this topic by presenting research findings from a qualitative study designed to explore, from the mothers' perspective, the decision-making experience with regards to subsequent birth choice for women who have previously delivered by Caesarean section. Specifically, the findings in this article present the perspective of the mothers who opted for elective Caesarean. Eighty per cent of mothers in this study chose elective Caesarean for reasons of fear and the desire to retain some control over the birthing process. For many, this decision is made prior to or early in pregnancy without any openness to consider other possibilities. Thus, the findings strongly emphasize the importance of understanding and taking into consideration the mothers' psychosocial perspective on birth choices as a key to providing counsel and support.Save to Libraryby Gillian Ray-Barruel•Supporting academic publication: evaluation of a writing course combined with writers' support groupSave to LibraryDownloadby Gillian Ray-Barruel and +2Matthew McGrailPeter O'Meara•Academic WritingChanges in serum procalcitonin and C-reactive protein following antimicrobial therapy as a guide to antibiotic duration in the critically ill: a prospective evaluationSerial procalcitonin is reported to be useful to titrate duration of antibiotic therapy in the non critically ill patient with pneumonia.

The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between antibiotic therapy and serial serum procalcitonin concentrations in a cohort of critically ill septic patients and examine for any differences between culture positive (CP) and culture negative (CN) sepsis. Seventy-five critically ill patients with suspected sepsis were enrolled in this prospective observational study. Serial procalcitonin and C-reactive protein assays were measured on days one, three, five, seven, 10 and 14. The mean duration of antibiotic therapy was similar in the two groups (10.4 +/- 5.1 (CP) vs. 8.4 +/- 5.1 (CN) days, P = 0.09). Serum procalcitonin concentrations were significantly higher at baseline in the CP than the CN group (14.9 +/- 22.9 vs. 6.8 +/- 21.5 ng/ml, P = 0.04). During the study period, serum concentrations of procalcitonin and C-reactive protein declined in both groups. Serum procalcitonin consistently remained higher in the CP group (P < 0.05) and did not return to normal values. In the CN group, procalcitonin concentrations fell below 0.5 only on day 10. There was no significant difference in C-reactive protein profile between the two groups. Four patients in the CP group (11%) had relapse of sepsis. The mean procalcitonins in the relapsed subgroup were lower than those in the remission subgroup (P = 0.02). Therapy for proven or presumed infections was associated with declining serum procalcitonin and C-reactive protein in critically ill septic patients. The marked variability and overlap in plasma profile of these markers between CP and CN sepsis makes it difficult to define a nadir plasma concentration at which one can recommend discontinuation of antibiotic therapy.Save to Libraryby Gillian Ray-Barruel and +1Peter Kruger•  2  Critical Care, SepsisSystematic Review of Infection Control Literature Relating to Intravascular DevicesSave to LibraryDownloadby Gillian Ray-Barruel•  2  Infection Control, Intravascular devicesAuthorial agreements: Get it in writing before you do the work!Save to LibraryDownloadby Gillian Ray-Barruel•Academic WritingNursing considerations to complement the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelinesObjectives: To provide a series of recommendations based on the best available evidence to guide clinicians providing nursing care to patients with severe sepsis.

We used the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system to rate the quality of evidence from high (A) to very low (D) and to determine the strength of recommendations, with grade 1 indicating clear benefit in the septic population and grade 2 indicating less confidence in the benefits in the septic population. In areas without complete agreement between all authors, a process of electronic discussion of all evidence was undertaken until consensus was reached. This process was conducted independently of any funding.Results: Sixty-three recommendations relating to the nursing care of severe sepsis patients are made. Prevention recommendations relate to education, accountability, surveillance of nosocomial infections, hand hygiene, and prevention of respiratory, central line-related, surgical site, and urinary tract infections, whereas infection management recommendations related to both control of the infection source and transmission-based precautions. Recommendations related to initial resuscitation include improved recognition of the deteriorating patient, diagnosis of severe sepsis, seeking further assistance, and initiating early resuscitation measures. Important elements of hemodynamic support relate to improving both tissue oxygenation and macrocirculation. Recommendations related to supportive nursing care incorporate aspects of nutrition, mouth and eye care, and pressure ulcer prevention and management. Pediatric recommendations relate to the use of antibiotics, steroids, vasopressors and inotropes, fluid resuscitation, sedation and analgesia, and the role of therapeutic end points.Conclusion: Consensus was reached regarding many aspects of nursing care of the severe sepsis patient. Despite this, there is an urgent need for further evidence to better inform this area of critical care.Save to LibraryDownloadby Gillian Ray-Barruel and +1Tom Ahrens•  3  Nursing, Critical Care, Sepsis
