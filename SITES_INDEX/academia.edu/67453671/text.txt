The main questions addressed are: how do the contexts of Archaic, Classical and Hellenistic votive miniature vessels inform us about the Greek cults in which they are used, and the transmission of such cults? What role did miniaturisation play in the sanctuaries and the rituals in ancient Greek society, and why miniaturisation? A number of supplementary questions accompany the main questions, for example, what did miniaturisation mean in the context of votive dedications in sanctuaries? This thesis aims to demonstrate that earlier explanations arguing that miniatures are simply and profoundly cheap substitutes for more expensive objects do not work well, since many of these small objects are carefully made and some are elaborately decorated, and would thus not have been cheaper, or less time consuming to produce compared to full sized objects. The chronological time frame of the thesis is limited to the Archaic to the Hellenistic period, and its core is three case studies with different themes and different geographical locations in focus (Kalydon, Olympia, Kombothekra, various sites in South Italy, and other sites for comparison). The thesis addresses also issues relating to, for instance, miniaturisation, imitation and models, the functionality, and non-functionality of small votive objects, agency, trade, and colonization. The study of ancient Greek dedicatory practices within the scholarship of Classical Studies tends to concentrate on votive statues, religious architecture, inscribed metal dedications, and stelai. Little attention has been paid to less extravagant dedications even though these groups of material have been found in abundant amounts in sanctuaries throughout Greece. Moreover, in those cases where this material has been published interpretation and thoroughly analyses are often lacking. As a result, this study makes important contributions to two large questions within Classical studies: how did the Greeks view their gods and how did the Greeks interact with the gods. Miniature pottery contributes to our understanding of ancient Greek ritual practice as well of specific rituals. The work presented in this thesis accentuates that miniature pottery’s material meaning and symbolic importance can no longer be dismissed.Download Free PDFView PDFOpuscula Atheniensa 6Archaic pottery and terracottas from the Sanctuary of Poseidon at Kalaureia2013 • Alexandra AlexandridouDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Archaeology and Ancient History (JAAH)Water at ancient Greek sanctuaries: medium of divine presence or commodity for mortal visitors2019 • Hedvig von Ehrenheim, Patrik Klingborg, Axel FrejmanThis article presents the newly started project “Water at ancient Greek sanctuaries: medium of divine presence or commodity for mortal visitors?”, the aim of which is to explore water usage at Greek sanctuaries in Archaic to Hellenistic times. In order to do so the project is divided into three separate studies. The first is how water was used in sanctuaries: where was water accessible through natural and man-made infrastructure, for what activities was it utilized, and which of these can be considered ritual and/or utilitarian? The second focuses on the means by which water was utilized, i.e. how was water management infrastructure adapted to ritual and utilitarian needs, and how did the need and access to water shape ritual and utilitarian activity at the sanctuary? The third part is an overarching analysis, combining the first two parts, which will expand our knowledge of perceptions of human activities in the god’s dwelling: how did ritual and utilitarian uses of water differ at a perceptual level?Download Free PDFView PDFReligious Landscapes, Places of Meaning. The Religious Topography of Arcadia, From the End of the Bronze Age to the Early Imperial Period.2016 • Julie BaleriauxThe thesis examines the religious topography of Arcadia through two particular aspects: the built and the natural landscape, and how each relates to human communities, their places of living, and their understanding of the world around. It relies on the assumption commonly made in the field that, since ritual practice was of prevalent importance for the Greeks, cult sites are the most important places for the communities, and therefore they can tell us a lot about the people who built, visited and looked after them. The first part rests on the acknowledgement that sanctuaries are places of interaction for a certain community of cult (which can but need not overlap with a given polis) and explores how they can be indicators of social change, defined here as responses to changes with large impact on the human milieu. These changes and their response articulated in sacred space are identified in four chapters. The first sets the stage and surveys the known sacred sites of Arcadia at the end of the Bronze Age and during the Dark Ages. The second looks at how the building of temples after the eighth century indicates a significant change in the way communities were structured in Arcadia. The third looks at how Arcadian sanctuaries responded to the increased religious mobility of the Classical and Hellenistic period. Finally, chapter four evaluates the impact of the Roman conquest on Arcadian religious sites. The second part explores how myths and rationalising discourses allowed the Greeks to make sense of the salient characteristics and numen of their surrounding natural landscape. Each of the three chapters departs from a situation observed in Arcadia by ancient sources and examines the responses articulated to explain it. Among the variety of topics to pursue, three have been selected because they exemplify a typical characteristic of Arcadia: its wetness. They also allow spatial areas that were less prominent in part one to be explored. The first chapter explores the apparent contradiction of having infernal rivers observable in the world of the living, such as the Styx flowing in the Aroania Mountains. The second chapter examines the connection made in ancient sources between Poseidon’s lordship over the Peloponnese, earthquakes, floods and cults of Poseidon Hippios in Arcadia. The third and last chapter investigates the attribution of Mycenaean waterworks in Arcadia to Herakles in myth.Download Free PDFView PDFArchaeological Reports 66Sanctuaries and cults in the Peloponnese: new evidence for sanctuaries and sacral contexts, 2010-20202020 • Maria SpathiDownload Free PDFView PDFDedicating and Sacralising  in the Archaic Sanctuary of Poseidon at Kalaureia on PorosAlexandra AlexandridouDownload Free PDFView PDFBibliografia santuario grecoRita SassuDownload Free PDFView PDFGods Over the Horizon: Terrestrial Orientations in Greek Temples [Revised August 2018]John Brady KieslingA number of archaic and later temples on the Greek mainland have an axial alignment toward a related high-prestige cult site over the horizon. These orientations should be viewed as potentially intentional. As such, they invite reconsideration of the social and political as well as religious considerations underlying a given temple's construction. A cluster of cultic alignments toward Delos might be connected to the role of Apollo and Artemis as plague gods. Other alignments suggest that the Roman habit of coopting local gods before key battles had Greek antecedents. The relative accuracy of these orientations, compared to that of Islamic mosques a millennium later, implies more sophisticated geometric capabilities than we usually attribute to 6 th c. BCE Greece. 1Download Free PDFView PDFAn Archaic Votive Deposit from Nemea - Ritual Behavior in a Sacred Landscape2009 • Signe BarfoedThis thesis presents material from an unpublished votive deposit discovered in a field on a low hill ca. 700 m. east of the Sanctuary of Zeus at Nemea. The deposit consists of about 1000 pieces of Archaic pottery mostly of Corinthian production. Different shapes of miniature vessels predominate, but the deposit also contains lamps and terracotta figurines. Even though no architectural remains were found, the miniature votive pottery and figurines indicate a shrine or small sanctuary in the area. Its location with a panoramic view of the Sanctuary of Zeus as well as close to a spring that provided water to the Sanctuary of Zeus, emphasizes the shrine’s connection to the sanctuary. The deity to whom this rural shrine might belong is difficult to identify. The generic assemblage of votive pottery and figurines does not contribute to identification. However, the location at a ravine next to a spring finds parallels in Etruria and South Italy, and the deposit may reflect the discontinuation of a shrine possibly dedicated to the water nymph Nemea, who in myth and history is tightly connected to the area.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
