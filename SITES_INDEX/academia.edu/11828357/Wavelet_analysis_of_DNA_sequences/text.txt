ProvataComplexity measures are used to compare the genomic characteristics of five organisms belonging to distinct classes spanning the evolutionary tree: higher eukaryotes, amoebae, unicellular eukaryotes and bacteria. The comparisons are undertaken using the full four-letter alphabet and the coarse grained two-letter alphabets AG-CT and AT-CG. We show that the conditional probability matrix for the four-letter and AT-CG alphabet is markedly asymmetric in eukaryotes while it is nearly symmetric in bacterial genomes. Spatial asymmetry is revealed in the four-letter alphabet, signifying that the probability fluxes are nonvanishing and thus the reading sense of a sequence is irreversible for all organisms. Calculations of the block entropy and excess entropy demonstrate that the human genome accommodates better all possible block configurations, especially for long blocks. With respect to point-to-point details and to spatial arrangement of blocks the exit distance distributions from a parti...Download Free PDFView PDFMultifractal analysis of DNA walks and trails2002 • José Fernando Fontanari, Alexandre  RosasDownload Free PDFView PDFIl Nuovo Cimento DStatistical and linguistic features of noncoding DNA: A heterogeneous «Complex system»1994 • Rosario N MantegnaSummary We present evidence supporting the idea that the DNA sequence in genes containing noncoding regions is correlated, and that the correlation is remarkably long range-indeed, base pairs thousands of base pairs distant are correlated. We do not find such a long-range correlation in the coding regions of the gene; we utilize this fact to build a Coding Sequence Finder algorithm, which uses statistical ideas to locate the coding regions of an unknown DNA sequence. We resolve the problem of the «non-stationarity» feature ...Download Free PDFView PDFBiophysical ChemistryThe pH-dependent structure of calf thymus DNA studied by Raman spectroscopy1982 • S.

The symbolic DNA sequence is mapped into a nonlinear time series. By studying this time series the existence of fractal shapes and symmetries will be shown. At first step, the indicator matrix enables us to recognize some typical patterns of nucleotide distribution. The DNA sequence, of the influenza virus A H1N1, is investigated by using the complex representation, together with the corresponding walks on DNA; in particular, it is shown that DNA walks are fractals. Finally, by using the wavelet analysis, the existence of symmetries is proven.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
