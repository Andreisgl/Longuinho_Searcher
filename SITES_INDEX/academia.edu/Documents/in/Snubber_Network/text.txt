Currently, the pressure reduction is carried out by throttling valves while considerable amount of pressure energy is wasted. One of the equipment which could be used to recover this waste energy is the reciprocating expansion engine. The purpose of this research is to simulate one-sided reciprocating expansion engine thermodynamically for TBS pressure range. The simulation is based on first law of thermodynamics, conversation of mass and ideal gas assumptions. The model could predict in-cylinder pressure and in-cylinder temperature at various crank angles. In addition, the effects of the engine geometrical characteristics, such as intake and exhaust port area and ports timing on the Indicated work per cycle output are investigated.Save to LibraryDownloadby hamideh sheikhani•ChemistryThe Choice of Appropriate Scenario in Order to Reduce the Effect of Thermal Pollution at the Damietta Branch Caused by Cooling Water Discharged from Kafr-Al-Batek Power StationSave to LibraryDownloadby Mohamed Mostafa•Environmental protectionNumerical simulation of pressure pulsation effects of a snubber in a CNG station for increasing measurement accuracySave to LibraryDownloadby Meisam Sadi•  16  Mechanical Engineering, Applied Mathematics, Capacitor Switched Regenerative Snubber Circuit Fot Dc Dc Boost Converter, Reciprocating CompressorsA Numerical Model of Fluid Structure Interaction of a Fluttering ValveSave to LibraryDownloadby Hasan  Gunes•Passive pressure pulsation damping using shaped nozzlesSave to LibraryDownloadby Piotr Cyklis•A CFD Based Identification Method Of The Transmittances For the Pulsating Gas Installation Element Part II: Experimental ValidationSave to LibraryDownloadby Piotr Cyklis•The influence of port shape on gas pulsations in a screw compressor discharge chamberGas pulsations in suction and discharge chambers are widely accepted to be a significant source of noise in screw compressors.

The stations utilize compressors to increase pressure. The compressor produces a flow pulsation, which affects the accuracy of the measurement. The main aim of this article is to decrease the compressor effects on measurement accuracy by utilizing a snubber between the turbine flow meter and the reciprocating compressors. For this aim, numerical modeling has been built to simulate natural gas flow through a snubber. The effects of various snubber parameters on pressure pulsation have been investigated. The parameters included snubber volume to the minimum volume ratio, the ratio of height to diameter, outlet pipe length, and the existence and non-existence a buffer. The Ansys Fluent has been used for numerical modeling with transient analysis. Results show that in H/D value of 3, the maximum reduction in the percentage of pressure pulsation drop is about 47% and increasing the outlet pipe length to the 10 times of initial length causes a decrease of about 83% in pressure pulsations. Besides, for the ratio of snubber volume to the minimum volume from 1 to 16.7, the amplitude of pressure pulsations decreases from 4.1% to 0.25%. ARTICLE HISTORYSave to LibraryDownloadby K.W.
