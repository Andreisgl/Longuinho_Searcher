Thus a Biblical passage, Dan. 11:21–24 is considered inaccurate in por-traying Antiochus IV’s accession as a gradual one that required extended political strategy. A new study of the coins of Antiochus, son of Seleucus IV, and Antiochus IV and of all these texts, however, will suggest that Antiochus, son of Seleucus IV, was king by himself for at least a couple of years if not from 175 until170 when he was executed, and that Dan. 11:21–24, while clearly polemical, and numismatics, while complicated, should be reconsidered as evidence in thereconstruction of an important sequence in the history of this period.Download Free PDFView PDFThe Rays of the Ptolemies, in Revue Numismatique 2012Catharine Lorber, Panagiotis IossifDownload Free PDFView PDFNon-Greek religious iconography on the coinage of Seleucid Syria.Nicholas L.
