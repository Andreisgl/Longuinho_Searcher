Exhibiting Antifascism, the Resistance, and the Holocaust in Postwar Italy and NowThe Journal of Holocaust Research, special issue - "Exhibiting the Holocaust in the Immediate Postwar Period: Histories, Practices and Politics," edited by: Rachel Perry and Agata Pietrasik,  2023The article discusses how anti-fascism, the Resistance, and the
Holocaust have been exhibited in ... more The article discusses how anti-fascism, the Resistance, and theHolocaust have been exhibited in Italy since the end ofMussolini’s regime. It uses the exhibition ‘Post Zang TumbTuuum,’ held at the Fondazione Prada in Milan in 2018, as astarting point to evaluate curatorial practices in the immediatepostwar period. The author positions ‘Post Zang’ as a culminationof a curatorial tradition of Resistance shows, which have theirroots in the mid-1940s. To this end, the author performs a closereading of the 2018 exhibition and its individual objects, castinga spotlight on the historical complexities that curator GermanoCelant and his team largely elided in wall texts, the catalogue, orother interpretative materials made available to audiences.Through the interpretative framework of the 2018 Milanexhibition, the article highlights two issues: how fascismabsorbed and neutralized political dissent by endorsing a relativeartistic freedom; and how the Resistance became, in theimmediate postwar period, a dominant narrative, whichmarginalized the Holocaust and promoted a redemptiveinterpretation of Italian victimhood, which partly absolved theItalians from both collusion with fascism and the Holocaust. Thisnarrative blurred, absorbed and partly obfuscated testimoniesand artistic narrations of the Holocaust, thereby in e!ect usingthe Holocaust instrumentally to the creation of anti-Nazinarratives of the Resistance.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Because of its ability to share experience and build community, oral history is being widely utilized as a tool to document and respond to the Covid global pandemic, which impacted social rituals and community building moments. Inspired by artists' use of oral history for socially engaged forms of art and in light of Italy's tradition of oral history theory, the article identifies important historical precedents and methodological coordinates for an oral history of art as an understudied and underdeveloped area of research in this country.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Depero’s first stay in New York in 1928–1930 was far from successful: in the midst of the Wall Street crash and its aftermath, his paintings failed to sell and his commercial enterprise in the city, the Futurist House, did not survive longer than a couple of months. The artist, however, created a myth out of his experience when he went back to Italy. For more than ten years, he wrote extensively about his American experience and dedicated several works to New York, in a variety of mediums. These expressed extreme enthusiasm about the city, as well as antagonism and even anger against it. After the fall of Mussolini, Depero returned to the ‘New Babel’ for two more years (1947–1949), which, again, proved a fiasco. Paradoxically for a Futurist, he was ultimately happy to leave the metropolis for a bucolic retreat in the suburbs of Connecticut. Depero’s ambivalent love affair with New York was part of the changing debate on Americanism that took place in Italy during the 1930s and, then, in the reconstruction years after World War II. This was a major avenue for Italians to define and re-define their own modernity, and Depero – in his idiosyncratic way – played a central part in this pursuit.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

From artist Fortunato Depero opening his Futurist House in New York City to critic Germano Celant launching Arte Povera in the United States, Raffaele Bedarida examines the thick web of individuals and cultural environments beyond the two more canonical movements that shaped this project. By interrogating standard narratives of Italian Fascist propaganda on the one hand and American Cold War imperialism on the other, this book establishes a more nuanced transnational approach. The central thesis is that, beyond the immediate aims of political propaganda and conquering a new market for Italian art, these art exhibitions, publications, and the critical discourse aimed at American audiences all reflected back on their makers: they forced and helped Italians define their own modernity in relation to the world's new dominant cultural and economic power. The book will be of interest to scholars working in art history, social history, exhibition history, and Italian studies.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Curating Fascism: Exhibitions and Memory from the Fall of Mussolini to Todayby Raffaele Bedarida and Sharon HeckerCurating Fascism: Exhibitions and Memory from the Fall of Mussolini to Today, Bloomsbury,  2022On the centenary of the fascist party in Italy's ascent to power, Curating Fascism examines the w... more On the centenary of the fascist party in Italy's ascent to power, Curating Fascism examines the ways in which exhibitions organized from the fall of Benito Mussolini's regime to the present day have shaped collective memory, historical narratives, and political discourse around the Italian ventennio. It charts how shows on fascism have evolved since the postwar period in Italy, explores representations of Italian fascism in exhibitions across the world, and highlights blindspots in art and cultural history, as well as in exhibition practices.Featuring contributions from an international group of art, architectural, design, and cultural historians, as well as journalists and curators, this book treats fascism as both a historical moment and as a major paradigm through which critics, curators, and the public at large have defined the present moment since World War II. It interweaves historical perspectives, critical theory, and direct accounts of exhibitions from the people who conceived them or responded to them most significantly in order to examine the main curatorial strategies, cultural relevance, and political responsibility of art exhibitions focusing on the Fascist period. Through close analysis, the chapter authors unpack the multifaceted specificity of art shows, including architecture and exhibition design, curatorial choices and institutional history, cultural diplomacy and political history, and theories of viewership and constructed collective memory, to evaluate current curatorial practice.In offering fresh new perspectives on the historiography, collective memory, and understanding of fascist art and culture from a contemporary standpoint, Curating Fascism sheds light on the complex exhibition history of Italian fascism not just within Italy but in such countries as the USA, the UK, Germany, and Brazil. It also presents an innovative approach to the growing field of exhibition theory through bringing contributions from curators and exhibition historians, who critically reflect upon curatorial strategies with respect to the delicate subject of fascism and fascist art, into dialogue with scholars of Italian studies and art historians, to address the physical and cultural legacy of fascism in the context of the current historical moment.Table of ContentsList of FiguresNotes on ContributorsAcknowledgmentsIntroductionPart One: Rethinking Historical Exhibitions in Italy1.

Come riconoscere i limiti e le manipolazioni dell’archivio quandolo si espone al pubblico? Le lezioni affrontano tre casi studio: un artista, Corrado Cagli, parte attiva della propaganda fascista,ma anche censurato in quanto ebreo e apertamente gay; una mostra Post Zang Tumb Tuuum del 2018, che si proponeva comeespressione di una “storia reale e contestuale” rievocando il passato fascista attraverso l’uso massiccio di opere d’arte e materialid’archivio; lo sforzo proiettivo, fatto collettivamente da artisti, critici, galleristi e politici italiani, per mostrare il volto modernodell’Italia negli Stati Uniti attraverso una serie di mostre tra gli anni Venti e Sessanta.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Ceramics to Re-build Italy: Lucio Fontana in “Italy at Work”Conference: Italy at Work: the Italian Lifestyle on Display,  2022Fontana, uno degli artisti simbolo della rinascita italiana dopo la Seconda guerra mondiale, ha p... more Fontana, uno degli artisti simbolo della rinascita italiana dopo la Seconda guerra mondiale, ha partecipato alle principali mostre di arte italiana organizzate negli Stati Uniti a cavallo tra anni Quaranta e Cinquanta, Handicraft as Fine Art in Italy (1947), Twentieth Century Italian Art (1949) e Italy at Work(1951-53). In tutti e tre i casi presentava opere in ceramica. Il mio studio colloca questa scelta nella retorica della Ricostruzione in Italia, che vede nella ceramica il lavoro povero e dignitoso di un'Italia laboriosa impegnata umilmente a tirarsi su con le proprie forze e la propria creatività. Si tratta di una retorica centrale in Italy at Work  - a partire dalla copertina illustrata dall'artista Corrado Cagli con l'immagine di un ceramista al tornio - anche con l'intento di distanziare la nuova rinascita italiana dal recente passato fascista. Il caso di Fontana tuttavia rivela inquitanti linee di continuità proprio con quel passato. Se infatti le ceramiche fontaniane degli anni Trenta venivano rilette nel dopoguerra in chiave antiretorica e addirittura antifascista, in realtà rientravano pienamente nel discorso fascista di un artigianato radicato nelle tradizioni locali e letteralmente legato alla terra.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
