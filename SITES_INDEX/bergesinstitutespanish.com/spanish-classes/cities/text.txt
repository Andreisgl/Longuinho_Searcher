Eva was a great instructor. She was patient and explained things well. I was excited to see how much I learned after just one class.

The written materials were extremely helpful, and the teacher was knowledgeable and patient. As someone who hasn't taken a Spanish course since college (a long, long time ago), I thought the course was excellent.

I like it very much. I got some god basics for Spanish, only I was a bit overwhelmed with the amount of vocabulary since I’m not familiar with Spanish at all. Everything is organized very well and always runs according to schedule and I will definitely be coming back to continue my education.

I learned more than I expected to in this course and really enjoyed myself. The emphasis on structures in Spanish made a lot of sense and helped me learn and retain vocabulary by creating original sentences. More time could have been given to students to talk to each other to practice new words and structures.

I liked the way the course stuck to the vocabulary already learnt and didn't expects us to learn anything new outside of the textbook. The homework also kept us accountable. 
 
FAQ
                        How many students are in each class?
                    
                        Between 4 and 10, usually.
                    
                        What age are the students, on average?
                    
                        Most students at Berges are between 25 and 70 years old, although we have many students who are younger or older than that.
                    
                        Do you speak only in Spanish during classes?
                    
                        Nope, we speak mostly in English in Levels 1 and 2, and then progressively add more and more Spanish. Conversation classes are 100% in Spanish.
                    
                        Do you use Zoom for the classes?
                    
                        We use BlueJeans, which is similar to Zoom. You can either download the app or join the classes directly in the browser.
