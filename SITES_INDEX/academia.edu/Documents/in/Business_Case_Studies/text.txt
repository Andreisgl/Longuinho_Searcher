The field research reported in this document contains information specific to the telecommunications industry. An examination of the history, organization design, problems and solutions for one telecommunications company are undertaken from the perspective of academic work in the Theory of Constraints. The information included in this document was developed through interviews with four senior managers including the President, the Chief Technology Officer, a Vice President and a department manager. Their responses were the basis of identifying problems and undesirable effects. The undesirable effects were diagramed in six UDE clouds dealing with the following issues: 1- unclear vision from management to employees; 2- supplier; 3- market; 4- the price and regulation environment; 5- production; and 6- bureaucracy.

Presently, Publix serves over one million customers every day and is one of the largest employee-owned companies in the world. Publix is one of Floridas premier supermarkets and has responded to most cultural trends in the grocery market-organic foods; natural foods, health foods, ethnic ingredients, prepared meals, etc. Publix has enjoyed great success in the grocery industry and has expanded in many states. With the advent of globalization affecting almost every industry, the supermarket/food retailing industry has joined the trend. Domestic and international food retailers across the globe have begun to internationalize at a rapid rate and open operations around the world. However, as you will see, the growth of supermarket chains beyond their home countries has been done mostly by European and Asian companies.

She had just left the offices of the Metropolitan Transit Authority (the “MTA”) where she had once again been awarded the license for use of New York City Subway Line graphics for her apparel business. Lynne had invested years of her life and her life savings in her small business, and she was at a crossroad. Her business, New York City Subway Line, had just passed a $1 million benchmark in annual sales, but she was concerned about the future of her small enterprise. On one hand, her business was well-established in the New York City gift market, which was somewhat profitable but limited and under constant threat of competition from unlicensed counterfeits which the MTA had allowed to proliferate. On the other hand, she believed there was a much larger and potentially more lucrative urban-chic lifestyle apparel market.

Accordingly, there has been a growing academic discussion and debate about the usability of the case study with regard to its reliability. It has been accused of being a less rigorous, undependable, and ungeneralizable research method. The condemnation has led scholars and professionals among the researcher community to raise viewpointsthat represent different schools of thought. Each school demonstrated its perception regarding the debate, of course with some concern. Whereas a section of researchers or scholars encourages the method as a useful approach, the other emphasizes its argument based on, among other things, what they call ‘lack of reliability’ of the case study, particularly external validity – whether a study carried out in the approachcould indeed be generalized.Save to LibraryDownloadby Mohamed A Eno and +1abderrazak  dammak•  163  Business, Business Administration, Business Ethics, Teaching and LearningHow Young Is Too Young: Marketing To The Tween Generation...

Textbooks tend to focus on the information technology area which may lead students to overlook the need for business resumption planning in other areas.

Comparisons of students responses to a questionnaire regarding business resumption planning showed that students who completed the case demonstrated a stronger understanding of the topic than those who did not.Save to LibraryDownloadby Chih-Chen Lee•  3  Accounting Information Systems, Business Case Studies, Accounts PayableA Fuzzy Topsis Approach For Logistics Center Location SelectionIt is clearly known that urban freight transportation has a significant role on sustainable development of urban areas.

The persistent growth of the costs of freight transportation and as a result of congestion, environmental pollution and increasing inefficient usage of land in urban areas are forcing users and public authorities to develop alternative logistic solutions to relieve the freight traffic problem. Establishing logistics centers is one of these alternative solutions. Logistics centers are specific centers that various logistic based activities like distribution, storage, transportation, consolidation, handling, customs clearance, imports, exports, transit processes, infrastructural services, insurance, banking and similar commercial activities are performed. These centers are defined for national and international all logistic and related operations.

We address the core research themes of our study using a survey of 800 Greek households. Our intention is to test consumers&#39; perceptions in order to investigate the potent influence of some set of variables, (discussed in the consumer research literature), in order to analyze repurchase intention for technological advanced food products in developing economies. The proposed model is not intended to explain all consumption behavior related to alternative food products. We believe that the final findings of our research can advance retailers&#39; strategic tries as it seems that geographical differentiation is needed to be considered, in terms of pricing and promotion planning at a store level in developing countries.Save to LibraryDownloadby Konstantinos Vasileiou•  3  Economics, Consumer, Business Case StudiesStock Market Valuation Using The P/E Ratio: A Hands-On ExerciseFinance professors and media frequently use the P/E ratio of the S&P 500 Index to gauge whether the aggregate stock market is correctly valued at a given point in time.

This article presents an assignment that introduces students to the concept of stock market valuation via a hands-on exercise. In particular, it requires students to use an EXCEL template to calculate various versions of the P/E ratio (trailing, forward, operating, and Shillers), gauge whether the stock market is correctly valued, undervalued or overvalued, and then examine the sensitivity of these inferences to using different versions of this ratio. The entire exercise can be implemented using data available in the public domain.Save to LibraryDownloadby Puneet Jaiprakash•  3  Economics, Behavioral Finance, Business Case StudiesDoes Financial Leverage Influence Investment Decisions?

We expect to contribute to the existing literature by bringing evidence from a panel data set, which comprises 27firms, all listed on the Stock Exchange of Mauritius (SEM), sampled over a 15 year-period (i.e. from 1990 to 2004). In addition, we demarcate between two types of firms, namely: (i) high-growth firms; and (ii) low-growth firms. The results reveal a significant negative relationship between leverage and investment. More interestingly, while we found a negative relationship between leverage and investment for low growth firm, our econometric results reveal an insignificant relationship between the two variables for high growth firm.Save to LibraryDownloadby Hemant B Chittoo•  2  Panel Data, Business Case StudiesGenerating Combinations: A Case Study In Database Design, Recursion, VBA, And SQL ProgrammingSave to LibraryDownloadby Padmini Varanasi•  3  Recursion, VBA, Business Case StudiesHow To Raise Social Capital: An Experiential ExerciseSocial capital is a critical aspect for launching a new venture.

In the popular press and entrepreneurial education classrooms, develop your network is one of the most common pieces of entrepreneurial advice. Developing social capital is a crucial entrepreneurial competence. Three common questions are: What is the idea of a network of relationships as social capital? What are the dimensions of effective networks? How can nascent entrepreneurs develop strategies and abilities for building a valuable network? At Sierra Nevada College, the Sharon M. Croom Center for Entrepreneurial Leadership Teaching Fellows have designed the Entrepreneur Network Experiential Exercise to get students into thinking about these social capital resource questions and taking action in developing social networks.Save to LibraryDownloadby Peter  Hackbert•  4  Entrepreneurship, Social Capital, Networking, Business Case StudiesEquestrian Trail Riding: An Emerging Economic Contributor To The Local Rural Appalachian EconomyThe purpose of this paper is three-fold.

The current outlook is exceptionally uncertain, with risks still weighing on the downside. The banking system appears adequately capitalized and highly profitable, but risks of a future deterioration of asset quality are still threatening the banks financial situation. Fundamental measures should be taken in order to strengthen the banking supervision to contain the fiscal risks related to the emergency liquidity facilities.Save to LibraryDownloadby Viviane Naimy•  2  Business Case Studies, Liquidity riskToo Little Or Too Much Competition?

Managing local political and legal environments along with using relationship marketing tactics implemented cross-functionally, this Midwestern company challenged incumbent monopolies for market share. While the company spent more than one year acquiring legal permission to access the market and another year building its fiber optic telecommunications network, it also constructed relationships with community leaders, politicians, media outlets, and thousands of residents. Its monopoly competitors utilized state laws and the legal process in an attempt to prevent the Midwestern companys entry into the market.

Some of these peoples are historic and rich with culture, while others are relatively new in history and evolving every day. These cultures are not self-reliant, nor are they self-communicating.  Spread out across every continent, the various cultures and countries of the world are morphing and forming relationships at a rate faster than ever before. As technology continues to flourish, markets and economies continue to become intertwined as well. Cultures and business practices are often vastly different. A serious effort from global business leadership needs to be placed on learning about culture as business deals are formed and negotiated. India is an Asian country containing both a rich history, as well as an extremely significant presence in the current global economy.
