Bus statistics
Statistics on the local bus sector in Great Britain, presenting information on passenger journeys, vehicle miles, levels of revenue, costs and government support, the vehicle fleet, staff employed and other indicators including punctuality. The department also collects statistics on concessionary travel, covering pass holders, journeys, expenditure and reimbursement to operators.
The majority of these statistics are updated annually, with information on bus fares available quarterly.
Bus statistics information on current and previous annual bus, quarterly bus, and concessionary travel statistics are available.

Data tables

Historical bus statistics data tables and discontinued bus statistics data tables are also available for download.

About the bus statistics data and reports
Most of the statistics are from an annual survey of over 500 bus operators. Some figures are from smaller surveys of local authorities (for example, concessionary travel), the larger bus operators or other sources. London figures are provided by Transport for London.
Concessionary travel statistics tables containing data supplied by local authorities and industry bodies and those relating to bus service provision are outside the scope of National Statistics. The department’s view is that all statistics which are not designated are robust and have been produced to a suitable standard.
Full details of the data sources and methods used can be found in the bus and concessionary travel information page.
