Materials and Methods: Altogether, 59 apparently healthy male buffaloes sacrificed at slaughterhouse were selected (irrespective of breed) for measuring SC and collecting blood and paired SVs. The SC was measured at greater curvature using soft thread. In the present study, blood plasma testosterone, cholesterol, protein, and glucose in addition to SV fructose, citric acid and proteins in SV fluid were also estimated. The SV tissue was fixed in RNAlater for RNA extraction.Male buffaloes were categorized as per total SV weight into Group I (<5.0 g), Group II (5.0-7.84 g), and Group III (>8.0 g) and dentitions-I (≤18 months), II (18-24 months), and III (≥24 months) to assess the effect of weight and dentition age on SC, SV weight, and its certain secretions. Data were analyzed using linear model procedure including Tukey HSD test and Pearson's correlation coefficient. Variance inflation and condition index were also used to assess multicollinearity. Results: Gross and histomorphological evaluation of SVs did not show any abnormality. Macronutrients (plasma protein, glucose, and cholesterol) showed non-significant (p>0.05) variation between groups. The SC and SV weight varied significantly (p<0.05) with a significant positive relationship with plasma testosterone, SV protein, fructose, and citric acid. In addition, testosterone concentration also showed increasing trend from Groups I to III but increased significantly (p<0.05) from Group II to III with positive and significant correlations with SV protein, fructose, and citric acid similar to SV weight and SC. Binders of sperm protein (BSP1, 3, and 5) genes (full length) were sequenced and established an evolutionary relationship which is lacking in buffalo. Conclusion: The present findings established a significant positive correlation of SC with that of other fertility parameters related to SVs weight and its secretions: Fructose, citric acid, and protein (inclusive of BSPs sequenced full length), and testosterone. Therefore, the present integrated approach along with certain semen quality attributes reflecting epididymis function could be used as a predictive fertility marker for grading and selection of breeding bulls and their progenies to develop outstanding bull mother farm.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersVeterinary WorldElectrophoretic profile of seminal proteins and their correlation with in vitro sperm characters in Black Bengal buck semen2019 • Veterinary  World, M. Karunakaran, Dr.Rajlaxmi BeheraAim: This study aimed to study the electrophoretic properties of seminal plasma and sperm proteins of Black Bengal buck semen and their correlation with in vitro sperm characters and freezability. Materials and Methods: Semen ejaculates from nine Black Bengal bucks were collected by artificial vagina (n=20/buck). Ejaculates were evaluated for in vitro sperm characters and electrophoretic profile of seminal protein. In vitro sperm characters were evaluated immediately after collection, after completion of equilibration period, and after freeze-thawing. For seminal protein studies, seminal plasma proteins were precipitated by ice-cold ethanol method, and sperm proteins were extracted by Triton X detergent extraction method. Discontinuous sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was performed to assess the molecular weight of seminal proteins. Correlation between in vitro sperm characters and protein bands was determined by Pearson's correlation coefficient, and two-way ANOVA was applied to find the individual buck differences. Results: Significant difference (p<0.01) among the bucks was noticed in the in vitro sperm characters evaluated at all the three stages of semen evaluation such as immediately after collection, after completion of equilibration period, and post-freeze thawing. Progressive loss of sperm motility, membrane integrity, and other in vitro sperm characters were noticed during cryopreservation. A total of ten protein bands in the molecular weight ranging from 17 to 180 kDa were found in the SDS-PAGE of seminal plasma proteins, while nine bands of 17-134 kDa were observed in sperm proteins. Seminal plasma proteins of molecular weight 75, 62-49, 20, and 17 kDa and sperm proteins of 75, 20, and 17 kDa were present in all the nine bucks (100%) screened, and variation among the bucks was noticed for the presence of other proteins. Seminal plasma protein of 180-134 kDa showed a negative correlation with individual motility (−0.716) and functional membrane integrity of sperm cells (−0.724) in post-freeze-thaw analysis and 48 kDa protein had a positive correlation with individual motility (0.649) and functional membrane integrity of sperm cells (0.664) in post-thaw analysis. Sperm proteins of 63 kDa had a negative correlation (−0.616) with sperm concentration in neat semen. Conclusion: Variation among the bucks was noticed in the in vitro sperm characters and semen freezability. Correlation between seminal proteins and in vitro sperm characters and semen freezability had been found which might be useful as a tool to select breeding bucks.Download Free PDFView PDFBubaline TheriogenologyReproductive physiology of male and female buffaloGovind Narayan PurohitThe reproductive physiology of the buffalo is similar to cattle in many aspects yet there are subtle differences in other aspects. Buffaloes exhibit marked influence of season on the expression of estrus, conception and calving in females [1,2] and depressed libido during hot summer months in males [2,3]. It has been mentioned that the timing of reproduction in buffalo species is highly variable. In subtropical and temperate countries, away from the equator, such as India, Pakistan and Italy [4,5], the breeding is seasonally dependent with breeding being favored during decreasing daylight length whereas in tropical countries near the equator the breeding is more dependent on the availability of feed [4]. Studies have demonstrated seasonal decline in sexual activity over many countries [6] in females [4,5,7-10] and males [11-14]. Therefore the breeding season for buffalo in the major buffalo rearing countries appear to extend from September to March [15-18]. Compared to cattle, buffaloes exhibit delayed puberty in both males [4,19] and females [1,8,20], poor estrus expression in a greater proportion of females [20,21], delayed postpartum estrus and prolonged inter-calving intervals [22]. Buffalo bulls have inherently lower libido [23], typically produce white colored semen [24] and buffalo bull semen has low contents of citric acid and fructose [25]. Female buffaloes inherently have lower population of primordial follicles in the ovaries [26,27] and evidence two to three follicular growth waves during the estrous cycle [28,29]. The estrus persists for 24-36 h and ovulation occurs 24-48 h after estrus onset [21]. Buffalo embryos have more lipid droplets and enter the uterus 96-108 h after ovulation [30,31] and rapidly develop into hatched blastocysts by Day 7 of ovulation [30]. Embryonic elongation is presumed to occur similar to cattle [32] and interferon-tau [33] and trophoblastic proteins are secreted during pregnancy that serve as molecules for placental remodeling, immune protection of the fetus and placenta and progesterone secretion [34]. The gestation period for the buffalo ranges from 310 to 330 days and the corpus luteum is presumed to be necessary for pregnancy maintenance in buffalo although the placenta also secretes some progesterone during later gestation [34]. Delayed postpartum estrus in the buffalo is presumed to be due to seasonal and management effects including nutrition [22]. Twinning is rare in the buffalo and the sex ratio of male to female births is 1.15:1 [35]. In this chapter the authors briefly describe the reproductive physiology of the male and female buffalo.Download Free PDFView PDFBubaline TheriogenologySemen characteristics and artificial insemination in the buffaloGovind Narayan PurohitBuffalo bull semen has been collected and cryopreserved [1,2] and has been widely used for artificial insemination [3-5] basically employing procedures similar to cattle. In India (between 2002-2007), 350,000 doses of frozen semen were available from buffalo bulls under progeny testing of Murrah and other breeds and artificial insemination was introduced in Bhadawari, Pandharpuri and swamp buffalo breeds [6]. Specific characteristics of buffalo bull semen include their smaller volume [2,7-10], typically white color [9], lower buffering capacity with a slightly acidic pH [10], presence of static ejaculates that regain motility on dilution [11-14] and higher contents of calcium and phosphatases and low contents of citric acid, hyaluronidase and fructose [10]. Buffalo bulls exhibit a profound effect of season on the semen quality [15-21]. Semen quality is better in swamp buffalo [22]. These and other factors render the freezability and fertility of buffalo semen poor compared to cattle bull semen [23-29]. Approaches to circumvent some of these problems in the recent past have led to experimentation with the use of various dilutors, cryoprotectants and cryoprotectant protocols [2]. When fully optimized, buffalo bull semen can be cryopreserved for prolonged periods with optimal fertility and can then be widely disseminated [2]. Poor estrus expression and variable time of ovulation in female buffaloes [30-34] is another obstacle as to the proper time of insemination in buffaloes. This has led to the use of timed inseminations procedures at many locations, yet the overall coverage of buffaloes with artificial insemination continues to be low. Based on a large number of studies we are critically mentioning the semen characteristics and artificial insemination in the buffalo. 1. Sexual Maturity Sexual maturity is attained in buffalo bulls at a higher age than cattle bulls [10,35]. Prepubertal development of the male reproductive organs in Nilli Ravi [35], Egyptian [36-38], Surti [39] and Murrah [40,41] buffalo calves revealed that the reproductive organs develop in buffalo calves by 6-12 months of age. Studies also revealed that the seminiferous epithelial cycle required 16 days in buffalo [42,43] and the duration of spermatogenesis in buffalo bulls was estimated to be 75 days [44,45]. The complete establishment of spermatogenesis occurs by 24 months in buffalo bulls [10] in contrast to 4-6 months in cattle bulls [46]. In a study on buffalo calves, spermatozoa were present in the epididymis at the age of 90 weeks [47]. The time lag between testosterone secretion (12 months) to support spermatogenesis (16 months) and finally achievement of puberty (2.5-4 years) is long [48] in buffalo. The average age at first service was 3.7 years in one study on Egyptian buffaloes [49] whereas in Murrah buffaloes the age was 27.2±1.37 months [50] and in Italian buffaloes the age was 2 years [51]. In Brazil, male Murrah buffaloes when reared in controlled management, with proper nutrition and subjected to a schedule of prophylactic health and weaning, reached puberty between 15-18 months [9,52]. An important parameter for evaluating male buffalo breeding capacity with little citation in the literature is the relation to the scrotal circumference (SC) [53,54]. Bhosrekar [55], recorded that the scrotal circumference for adult buffalo in India ranges from 30-34 cm. The relationship of scrotal circumference with age revealed that the scrotal circumference in buffalo bulls increases with age (Table 1). In studies on Jaffarabadi buffalo bulls the mean scrotal circumference in normal bulls was 33.89±1.19 cm [56] and the mean scrotal length and width was 15.20±0.14 cm and 12.39±0.51 cm respectively. A recent study found that Murrah buffalo bulls between the age of 25-36 months had a mean SC of 26.9 cm, the estimated testis weight was 261 g, semen volume was 2.5 mL and sperm concentration was 1677 x 10 6 /mL whereas the same parameters at the age of 60 months were 32.4 cm, 652 g, 3.6 mL and 1666 x 10 6 /mL respectively [57]. The mean trans-scrotal diameter in Surti buffalo bulls was 36.28 cm (29-45 cm) with high correlation of testis size with semen characteristics [58]. Testosterone levels in buffalo bulls has been observed to be nearly half compared to that observed in cattle [10] with testosterone levels being 1.58±0.32 ng/mL in young bulls [59] and 0.69 ± 0.12 ng/mL in aged buffalo bullsDownload Free PDFView PDFEffect of different concentrations of soybean lecithin and virgin coconut oil in Tris-based extender on the quality of chilled and frozen-thawed bull semenVeterinary  World(2017) Effect of different concentrations of soybean lecithin and virgin coconut oil in Tris-based extender on the quality of chilled and frozen-thawed bull semen, Veterinary World, 10(6): 672-678. Abstract Aim: The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of different concentrations of soybean lecithin (SL) and virgin coconut oil (VCO) in Tris-based extender on chilled and frozen-thawed bull semen quality parameters. Materials and Methods: A total of 24 ejaculates were collected from four bulls via an electroejaculator. Semen samples were diluted with 2% VCO in Tris-based extender which consists of various concentrations of SL (1, 1.25, 1.5, and 1.75%). A 20% egg yolk in Tris used as a positive control (C+). The diluted semen samples were divided into two fractions; one for chilling which were stored at 4°C for 24, 72, and 144 h before evaluated for semen quality parameters. The second fraction used for freezing was chilled for 3 h at 4°C, packed into 0.25 mL straws and then cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen. The samples were then evaluated after 7 and 14 days. Chilled and frozen semen samples were thawed at 37°C and assessed for general motility using computer-assisted semen analysis, viability, acrosome integrity and morphology (eosin-nigrosin stain), membrane integrity, and lipid peroxidation using thiobarbituric acid reaction test. Results: The results showed that all the quality parameters assessed were significantly (p<0.05) improved at 1.5% SL concentration in chilled semen. Treatment groups of 1, 1.25, 1.5, and 1.75% SL were higher in quality parameters than the control group (C+) in chilled semen. However, all the quality parameters in frozen-thawed semen were significantly higher in the C+ than the treated groups. Conclusion: In conclusion, supplementation of 1.5% SL in 2% VCO Tris-based extender enhanced the chilled bull semen. However, there was no marked improvement in the frozen-thawed quality parameters after treatment.Download Free PDFView PDFSemen characteristics, extension, and cryopreservation of Rusa deer (Rusa timorensisFitri Wan NorAim: The objective of this research is to report parameters for breeding soundness evaluation, semen extension, and cryopreservation in Rusa timorensis.Download Free PDFView PDFJOURNAL OF VETERINARY ANDROLOGY VOL 2 ISSUE 2 (JULY-DECEMBER) 2017.pdfHECTOR NAVA-TRUJILLODownload Free PDFView PDFBubaline Theriogenology Bubaline Theriogenology2020 • Govind Narayan PurohitThis is downloaded and joined pdf of our eBook Bubaline Theriogenology at the International Veterinary Information Science, Ithaca, New York.

The interaction between reproduction and nutrition becomes critical during the postpartum periods in high yielding dairy animals when most of the nutrients are utilized for lactogenesis and little are left for supporting reproductive activities.The primary objective of rearing dairy animals has been the production of milk. Selective breeding has been in practice and lactation has been considered as the most important economic trait. The two traits of lactation and reproductive efficiency have been found to be associated with each other; hence the selection for milk yield also led to enhanced fertility. However, beyond certain levels of milk production the drain of nutrients from the circulating blood results in cessation of reproductive process. The declining fertility with the enhanced lactation yield during the last several decades has been found both under total mixed ration in the USA as well as pastoral feeding in the New Zealand. The postpartum initiation of lactation coincides with a decreased feed intake and the animals enter into a state of negative energy balance (NEBAL). The energy deficiency is met out by the process of lipolysis, leading to loss of body condition score (BCS). Pulsatile release of LH and response of the follicle to LH surge are hindered. Such a condition leads to a delayed ovulation and lowered conception rates. Plasma levels of insulin-like growth factor-I are directly related to energy status and is critical to ovarian follicular development. During the early NEBAL period, the ability of follicles to produce sufficient estradiol for ovulation seems to depend on the availability of insulin and IGF-I in serum and the changing energy balance profile. Leptin has been discovered as a product of white adipose tissues, reflecting the energy status of the body. Leptin concentrations are lower during a declining BCS and vice versa; being favorable during the rising concentrations. Hence leptin has been called as the permissive factor for the reproductive process. The animals get out of NEBAL when the nutrients intake exceeds utilization and the BCS starts raising. It leads to resumption of ovarian cyclicity and conception. Poor nutrition and weight loss in cattle causes a decrease in blood progesterone concentrations. One possibility is that greater milk production in dairy cattle is negatively affecting blood progesterone concentrations and causinginfertilityindairycows. Lower plasma concentrations of progesterone have been reported in cows with higher milk yield. There are several potential mechanisms for decreased progesterone in highproducing cows. Progesterone concentrations in blood are determined by rates of secretion, metabolism and clearance through liver. In dairy buffaloes, crude protein intake (CPI) was positively correlated with the postpartum estrusand ovulationintervals (POI). CPI excess torequirements was lower in animals which expressed oestrus than those which remained anoestrus. Prepartummetabolizable energy (ME) intake was higher in animals observed in oestrous than those remaining anoestrous. The animals resuming to oestrus had a narrow and almost constant CP/ME ratio, while the anoestrus animals had a widely fluctuating ratio, ranging from 10.7 to 13.1 g/MJ. CP/ME was related positively with POI. Increasing energy intake increased BCS (r=0.16) and duration of expulsion of placenta(r=0.19) and discharge of lochia (r=0.24) but decreasedpostpartum ovulation interval (r=-0.27, p<0.01).Reproductive process is regulated by the hypothalamus-pituitary gonadal axis and it functions only if the hypothalamus pituitary adrenal (or stress) axis is silent. Dairy cattle face the challenge of stress associated with higher metabolic rates, lactation, higher ambient temperatures and malnutrition. Oxidative stress results due to imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species in higher quantities than their clearance through the antioxidant system. It causes damage to the cellular function, decreasing the production of hormones and gene products boosting the reproductive process. Antioxidants nutritional supplementation helps the dairy animals in maintaining reproductive activities.Download Free PDFView PDFVeterinary WorldIndividual variation in fresh and frozen semen of Bali bulls (Bos sondaicus)2020 • Veterinary  World, R. IndriastutiAim: This study aimed to analyze the individual factors influencing the sperm quality of Bali bulls at Baturiti Artificial Insemination (AI) center. Materials and Methods: Semen that was ejaculated from nine Bali bulls was collected using artificial vaginas (n=5/bull). Semen ejaculates were evaluated immediately after collection to measure the quality of the fresh semen, including semen volume, sperm concentration, progressive motility, membrane integrity (MI), and abnormal morphology. Frozen semen was evaluated for progressive sperm motility, concentration, viability, MI, abnormal morphology, and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) fragmentation. Other secondary data, focusing on semen quantity (semen volume and sperm concentration), were also collected from frozen the semen production data of the Baturiti AI center from 2017 to 2019. Data were analyzed statistically using a completely randomized design, and one-way analysis of variance was applied to find differences among individual bulls. Results: Significant differences (p<0.05) were found among the bulls in semen volume, sperm motility, concentration, and MI of the fresh semen. Significant differences (p<0.05) were also found among the bulls in sperm motility, viability, MI, abnormal morphology, and DNA fragmentation of the frozen semen. Conclusion: Individual variation in all the tested sperm parameters of the fresh semen of Bali bulls, except sperm viability and abnormalities, was noted. Similarly, individual variation in all the tested sperm parameters in frozen semen, except sperm concentration, was noted. Therefore, individual factors can be used for selecting a superior bull in Bali cattle.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
