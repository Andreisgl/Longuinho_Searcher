The current study explored the aspects which mediate individuals' information and perception of natural wine, and the rationale behind natural wine consumption behavior among Italian (n = 501) and Spanish (n = 527) regular wine consumers. The results reveal a quite low self-reported degree of perceived information by Italian respondents and slightly higher levels among Spanish ones. The key drivers of natural wine consumption in both countries are wine consumption frequency, information, and natural product interest. In contrast, higher wine involvement levels decrease natural wine consumption frequency in both Italy and Spain. The findings also show that different perceptions lead to diverse motivations, suggesting the need for more homogeneous standards to mitigate the level of information asymmetry currently on the market.Save to LibraryDownloadby Pablo Alonso González and +1Eva Parga-Dans•  17  Economic Anthropology, Agricultural Economics, Wine Economics, Food MarketingSubjectivity, Class, and Marx's “Forms of the Commune”...

Simply put, more people are using more energy and creating and using more “stuff” than ever before in the history of the planet. Besides lamenting the passing of low-impact village-level societies, what does anthropology have to say about consumer culture which might actually be useful in thinking our way towards more sustainable levels of consumption? I argue that a drastic re-orientation of the way we teach anthropology is in order; what do we want our students to learn about the world and what kind of skills do they need? The same argument can be made for the public messages we extend in our popular publications.Save to LibraryDownloadby Richard R Wilk•  9  Anthropology, Climate Change, Sustainable Production and Consumption, Political EcologyAnthropology and Ethnographic Research in PeristanAn overview of the anthropological research on the Kalasha and neighbouring peoples of Chitral and Nuristan, carried out by the authors over a period of many decades, starting from 1973.Save to LibraryDownloadby Alberto M Cacopardo and +1Augusto S Cacopardo•  17  Political Anthropology, Economic Anthropology, Indo-European Studies, Afghanistan2015.

Ethnography can be understood both as a process and as a product. As a process, it is for the anthropologist the same thing laboratory research is for the scientist and survey for the sociologist, the method par excellence. It has to meet three main requirements: long time residence among the members of the studied culture, linguistic proficiency and must be conducted in the form of participant observation. Understood as a product, ethnographic monograph must be holistic and to adopt the emic perspective, as opposed to the etic one.Save to LibraryDownloadby Sergiu Bălan•  4  Anthropology, Research Methodology, Economic Anthropology, EtnographyCHINAMPA AGRICULTURE, SURPLUS PRODUCTION, AND POLITICAL CHANGE AT XALTOCAN, MEXICOThis article examines the productivity of agriculture at the Postclassic polity of Xaltocan, Mexico.

Employing multiple lines of data (remote sensing, artifactual, ecofactual, chronological, demographic, historic, ethnographic, and environmental), it reconstructs the potential productivity of an integrated raised field, chinampa system that surrounded the polity. This exercise reveals that the system was capable of producing a sizeable caloric surplus above the needs of the kingdom's estimated total population and the number of laborers necessary to maintain full production. To situate the processes related to agricultural production, the paper considers how farmers' strategies were articulated with multiple institutions. Increased integration between political, social, and household institutions possibly fostered residents' incorporation into the body politic and provided mechanisms to finance the political economy. Such integration and dependency fractured, however, when Xaltocan was conquered.Save to LibraryDownloadby Christopher Morehart•  32  Demography, Archaeology, Prehistoric Archaeology, AnthropologyShow me the money: Conspiracy theories and distant wealthABSTRACT This article explores the meanings of imagined, secret and hidden wealth that followers of conspiracy theory account for on different sides of the moral compass, as bad and good.

Conspiracy theory, astrand of intellectual practice exacerbated by the recent crisis inGreece, calls for exploring hidden wealth assets, while conspiracy’smirror-image, transparency, becomes central in the understandingof wealth in this conundrum. Through three stories, that of ArtemisSorras – a self-proclaimed trillionaire, of an anti-Semitic book andof conspiracist publishers in Greece, I examine the centrality of(un)accountable wealth in imaginations of peoples’ presents andpasts. I explore narratives of wealth in conspiracist discoursetrajectories, showing how wealth can play a role in imaginedallegiances and political practices. A focus on conspiracy theoryallows an exegesis of how obscure narratives of wealth areshaping the ways in which people conceptualize economic crisis.Notions of accountability and secrecy are central to their (and our)understandings of wealth – and are laden with contradictions,according to diverse paths of moralizing the past.

Veterans responded to debt collection by turning their own bodies into spectacles of debt and sacrifice by publicly removing and showcasing their debt-ridden prostheses. The media interest in these prosthetic spectacles further amplified the visceral threat of dismemberment evoked by veterans’ embodied performances. The public debates surrounding “prosthesis repossession” cases extended well beyond veteran welfare issues, inscribing all sorts of social and political anxieties on the amputee veteran body, such as anxieties around the incommensurability between the value regimes of nationalism and neoliberalism or around the Syrian refugees. Providing a window into larger questions about the interconnections between disability, gender, nationalism, and neoliberal capitalism, prosthesis repossession cases show us how debt and disability coproduce each other at the nexus of consumer debt and nationalist welfare in Turkey. By homing in on the prosthetic re-membering and dismembering of veteran bodies in a rapidly changing health milieu, we see how the political economy of violence and the violence of political economy become complicit in the production of debt, dismemberment, and prosthetic rehabilitation.Save to LibraryDownloadby Salih Can Aciksoz•  20  Gender Studies, Anthropology, Medical Anthropology, Disability StudiesThe Commodification of Menstrual HygieneHalf of the earth's population experiences menstruation at a certain point in her life.

In different cultures, several products are used to manage the menses. In the west, the most known menstrual hygiene products are disposable sanitary pads and tampons. These products are bought in stores and companies such as the Kimberley Clark Company and Carefree profit from these commodities (Radosevic, 2015: 24; Newton: 2016: 172). Advertisements help these companies to sell their products and advertisers play with the feeling of shame in their publicity spots and even have been imposing this feeling upon women during the past centuries (Berkely, 1982; Radosevic, 2015). Further, the medicalization of the phenomenon increases the feeling of necessity of the product. Nonetheless, not only companies, but also many governments profit from the 'insecurities' of women (Lapekas, 2013). Recently, many activists have been questioning the role of the governments in the commodification of menstrual hygiene and the so-called 'tampon tax' (Crawford & Spivack, 2017). Even though many ecological and less expensive reusable menstrual hygiene products are on the market, these are less well-known and not many women use them. Advertisements of these products are less frequent and less visible than those of disposable products on which more is to earn (Bobel, 2006). It becomes clear that menstrual hygiene products are commodified by patriarchal societies. Until today many governments consider menstrual hygiene products as luxury products and many women still buy them, afraid of someone noticing their menses. The female body as well as the feelings of shame of being other than men or of not being hygienic and clean are commodified (Johnston-Robledo & Stubbs, 2012; Radosevic, 2015). Nevertheless, activists try to break taboos, to inform women, and to question policies.Save to LibraryDownloadby Lise Kriekemans•  4  Gender Studies, Economic Anthropology, Menstruation, Commodification (Anthropology)J.

Particularly, the premise that agents consistently act rationally and with their self-interest in mind seems problematic. What the consequences of the criticism mean for Law and Economics’ tenability depends largely on the questions whether (1) some elements are unassailable to the alternative’s objections and (2) the alternative is a systematic whole. It is argued that Law and Economics may be salvaged, if it is minimized and its ambitions are tempered. This means focusing on the stable, a priori, elements inherent to it.Save to LibraryDownloadby Jasper Doomen•  187  Economic History, Psychology, Applied Psychology, Behavioural ScienceFuck NeoliberalismYep, fuck it.

They have also tended to project their values on those they identify as the victims of these processes.  Anthropology as a whole has been less attentive to working class and poor people whose attitudes and action advance right wing agendas.  Authoritarian populism, European cultural nationalism, Brexit, and of course the election of Donald Trump all derived decisive support from poor and working class communities that stand to gain little from these developments.  This chapter argues for a renewed attention to the corridors of power in which neoliberal policy is authored, as well as its multitude of "enablers" among the disenfranchised working class.Save to LibraryDownloadby Mark A Moberg•  3  Economic Anthropology, Populism, Neoliberalism"Sikret fren":  economic costs and moral values in a friendship ritual  in Honiara, Solomon IslandsSave to LibraryDownloadby Rodolfo Maggio•  4  Economic Anthropology, Solomon Islands, Value, HoniaraIndividualism or the Group?... a typical naive set of assumptions about "group oriented" cultures it that the participants within them are basically altruistic, self-effacing, self-sacrificing and sociable.

A society of such individuals should exhibit the very best of human civilization working in equitable, democratic communities. By contrast, those from individualistic cultures should be cold, grasping, selfish, egotistical and almost incapable of the cooperation demanded by a civil society.

The results which clearly showed, that systematic racial oppression still exists in the United States. When studies began to show that people failed to react to systematic racism, scholars and professionals began to examine race, racism, and racial inequality. wonder why people were turning a blind eye. On closer examination, racism in the U.S exposed both conscious and unconscious forms understood on several levels of perception. Since the beginning of American slavery, racism has evolved into new forms that guarantee marginalization of black people in the U.S. These two events allow for fine resolution of these forms to be teased out. Using class resources, arguments could be made that evidence supports the contention that the slowed response of the Federal Emergency Management Agency was linked to U.S social policy. The texts and videos provided by Dr. Christine A. Mcdonnell provided an in-depth look into the racist qualities of American politics and culture. Race as a biological construct has long affirmed that racist tendencies are excusable. Current genetic testing has confirmed otherwise, proving that we indeed share 99.9% of our DNA and that phenotypes, a set of observable characteristics of an individual, are what separate us visibly. Phenotypes occur for three reasons; Random mutations, introduction of new genes through conquest or trade, and environmental adaption. In the film, " Understanding Race, " (Daushtun, 1999) The Island of Redheads demonstrated that when gene variation becomes isolated by proximity, " isolated gene pools, " represented groups of people bound by location and intermarriage over time will begin to look alike. This film debunks the concept of race and the island of redheads represents groups of people having similar phenotypes not different races.Save to LibraryDownloadby Michelle  Skowronek•  5  Political Sociology, Political Philosophy, Black/African Diaspora, Social and Cultural AnthropologyPerpetual Suffering, Oppression and False HopeSave to LibraryDownloadby Ezequiel Jimenez•  13  Development Economics, Political Economy, Human Rights, Political AnthropologySorcery, Theft and Affinity: The Estrangement of Intimacy in Eastern JavaExplains why familiarity breeds contempt!Save to LibraryDownloadby Nicholas Herriman•  11  Anthropology, Social Anthropology, Social and Cultural Anthropology, Economic AnthropologyUnderstanding Digital Fundraising in Kenya A Case Study with M-ChangaA study of African Crowdfunding and its potential as a form of informal financeSave to LibraryDownloadby Sibel Kusimba•  9  Economic Sociology, Development Economics, Economic Anthropology, Behavioral EconomicsValor, prestigio e intercambio.

Today, with the current threats posed by climate change, this practice increases the dangers associated with rising sea levels.

Their interactions over time have prepared the way for Bolivian traders to directly engage with Chinese factories and for Chinese transnational companies to become interested in the Bolivian market. I argue for seeing the distribution network of consumer electronics into Bolivia as a dynamic regional economy. This regional exchange system has provided extraordinary opportunities of upward mobility for some Bolivian traders who have used credit from providers as a source with which to upscale business. The tracking of this cultural economic world between the Pacific-port town of Iquique and Highland Bolivia aims at historicising our understanding of popular commerce as it becomes increasingly connected to China-centred international markets, commodity chains and corporations. Such a narrative that looks at different moments of time in a spatially extended trade network enables us to apprehend changes in commercial dynamics and power relations among the actors involved. It sheds new light on popular commerce in the Andes as existent research focuses on persistent economic and cultural patterns instead of addressing transformations.Save to LibraryDownloadby Juliane Müller•  4  Economic Anthropology, Bolivia, Trade, Asians In Latin AmericaMoney from the Government in Latin America: Conditional Cash Transfer Programs and Rural LivesIt has been almost two decades since conditional cash transfer programs first appeared on the agendas of multilateral agencies and politicians.

Latin America has often been used as a testing ground for these programs, which consist of transfers of money to subsections of the population upon meeting certain conditions, such as sending their children to school or having them vaccinated. Money from the Government in Latin America takes a comparative view of the effects of this regular transfer of money, which comes with obligations, on rural communities.Drawing on a variety of data, taken from different disciplinary perspectives, these chapters help to build an understanding of the place of conditional cash transfer programsin rural families and households, in individuals’ aspirations and visions, in communities’ relationships to urban areas, and in the overall character of these rural societies.With case studies from Chile, Mexico, Peru, Brazil and Colombia, this book will interest scholars and researchers of Latin American anthropology, sociology, development, economics and politics.Save to LibraryDownloadby Martin Fotta•  16  Geography, Human Geography, Latin American Studies, Development StudiesRoutinized Business Innovation: An Undertheorized Engine of Cultural EvolutionScholars of cultural evolution and change have tended to conceptualize innovation as a process that results from individual experimentation involving random or very loosely guided trial-and-error alterations to existing cultural elements.... moreScholars of cultural evolution and change have tended to conceptualize innovation as a process that results from individual experimentation involving random or very loosely guided trial-and-error alterations to existing cultural elements. Alternatively, they have focused on individual experimentation via decision rules and different heuristics with already existing, potentially innovative cultural elements whose emergence is left unexplained. Based on ethnographic fieldwork I conducted with a number of business innovation consultancy groups in the United States, I theorize institutionalized innovation as a new engine of cultural evolution that might be unique to complex industrial societies characterized by intense intragroup competition that puts pressure on constant innovation. This engine might be responsible for a faster pace of cultural evolution. At stake is a systematic strategy of purposeful innovation that is neither entirely random nor entirely calculation based. Rather, it is based in the rationalized and rule-governed production of what I call “structured contingency,” and it is capable of being applied to products and services across different business domains, including to itself.Save to LibraryDownloadby Eitan Wilf•  11  Business, Anthropology, Organizational Theory, Social and Cultural Anthropology«Ho un luogo dove lavoro e un luogo dove abito.» Diversità e separazione in un distretto industriale in transizione«I have a place where I work and a place where I live»: Encounters with flexible families in a globalizing made in italy fast-fashion city The article analyzes several aspects related to the presence of migrant worker families,... more«I have a place where I work and a place where I live»: Encounters with flexible families in a globalizing made in italy fast-fashion city The article analyzes several aspects related to the presence of migrant worker families, primarily from the Chinese province of Zhejiang, in Prato’s industrial district. The ethnographic research highlights how Chinese families, specifically immigrants working in the fast-fashion manufacturing sector, adjust to recent dynamics of globalization. The collaborative project innovates an encounter ethnography methodology to understand how families and individuals negotiate the terms of transnational capitalism. The analysis shows how resources activated through mechanisms of reciprocity are central to sustaining competitiveness and flexibility. The authors explore some of the practices and contexts of urban life, such as those related to the management of time and of children on the part of parents, who often rely on grandparents or relatives living in China to care for their children for long periods. Analysis extends to the restrictive and discriminatory policies adapted by the local government concerning the use of public space in the urban zones, namely those where migrants have settled, as well as the successful challenge to one such policy.key words:  Globalization, Chinese immigration, Fast fashion, Family firms, Flexible Labor, Encounter ethnography.Save to LibraryDownloadby Massimo  Bressan•  3  Urban Anthropology, Economic Anthropology, Migration StudiesRitual exchange and the fourth obligation: ancient Maya food offering and the flexible materiality of ritualEmploying Mauss's notion of the fourth obligation, giving to the gods, this article develops a formulation of ritual exchange to examine the interactive nature of ritual practice.

As a modality of interaction, ritual exchange is contingent upon enduring normative beliefs, such as perceived obligations to spiritual entities, and the social positions of ritual practitioners. Consequently, ritual exchange evinces not only the material and immaterial nature of sacred beliefs but also the potential flexibility and fungibility of social interaction. By considering a relatively under-utilized form of data to study past ritual, archaeobotanical remains, we employ this perspective to explore the ancient Maya practice of offering foods in several caves in western Belize. These data exhibit complex configurations of commonality and variability, suggesting the potential flexibility and latent fungibility of ritual exchange.Employing Mauss's notion of the fourth obligation, giving to the gods, this article develops a formulation of ritual exchange to examine the interactive nature of ritual practice.

In particular, the book explores a crucial tension at the heart of the “war on drugs”: despite the violence and suffering brought on by drug cartels, for the rural poor in Mexico’s north, narcotrafficking offers one of the few paths to upward mobility and is a powerful source of cultural meanings and local prestige. In the borderlands, traces of the drug trade are everywhere: from gang violence in cities to drug addiction in rural villages, from the vibrant folklore popularized in the narco-corridos of Norteña music to the icon of Jesús Malverde, the “patron saint” of narcos, tucked beneath the shirts of local people. In When I Wear My Alligator Boots, the author explores the everyday reality of the drug trade by living alongside its low-level workers, who live at the edges of the violence generated by the militarization of the war on drugs. Rather than telling the story of the powerful cartel leaders, the book focuses on the women who occasionally make their sandwiches, the low-level businessmen who launder their money, the addicts who consume their products, the mules who carry their money and drugs across borders, and the men and women who serve out prison sentences when their bosses' operations go awry."Save to LibraryDownloadby Shaylih Ryan Muehlmann•  88  Cultural Studies, Human Geography, Cultural Geography, AnthropologySubprime Empire On the In-Betweenness of FinanceIn the decade since the 2008 global financial crisis, much of the debate has been over whom to blame: reckless speculative finance or irresponsible (often low-income) borrowers.

This essay takes up this set of moral arguments about what the poor can and should be able to afford by examining subprime logics at a global scale: subprime empire. Predatory lending in heartland America and development-oriented microcredit in places such as India and Paraguay appear not just to be geographically disparate but also to have different moral valences. After closer inspection, however, we argue that subprime lending and microfinance are two sides of the same coin. Our analysis of microfinance allows us to understand what is happening in the "in-between" as capital flows between financial investors and poor borrowers. By comparing financialization in India and Paraguay, we document and theorize the making of subprime empires that rely on actors within marginal financial sites to stabilize the evaluative frameworks and social interdependencies that make profits flow. We argue that the forms of financial capture and conversion in the "financial inbetween" reproduce imperial dynamics by naturalizing the limited expectations of economic subjects of the global south and erasing the violence inherent in these forms of economic redistribution that maintain those expectations as such.Save to LibraryDownloadby Carly Schuster and +1Sohini Kar•  5  Economic Anthropology, Microfinance, Paraguay, Ethnographic MethodsThe anthropology of financial intentMuch has been learned about calculation, commodification and marketization from the social studies of markets and finance.

What is distinctive about this mode of valuation and the reality it impels? What does it mean to live under the 'asset condition'? In Capitalization: A Cultural Guide, Fabian Muniesa and his colleagues at the Centre de Sociologie de l'Innovation take us on a tour across multiple continents and several centuries, introducing us to capitalization as a 'cultural syndrome'. Their pragmatist enquiry involves tracing capitalization via the scenarios in which value is created, and the gaze that stimulates such value-creation. The result is a field guide to the terrain of capitalization that integrates anthropological work on the dramaturgy of finance with sociological attention to the technicalities of valuation. The stage is set for further investigation into the uneven distribution of the capacity to capitalize and its consequences.Save to LibraryDownloadby Paul  Gilbert•  5  Economic Sociology, Economic Anthropology, Social Studies of Finance, CapitalizationCulture matérielle et changement : Alfred Métraux chez les ChiriguanoThe early ethnological works of Alfred Métraux are analysed bearing in mind his first fieldwork trip to the Chiriguano, in 1929.

[Key words: Alfred Métraux, Chané, Chiriguano, material culture, change.]Se analiza la etnología temprana de Alfred Métraux a la luz de su primer viaje de campo a los chiriguanos, en 1929. Se discute el perfil personal, académico y profesional de Métraux, las peculiaridades de su trabajo de campo en 1929 y sus relaciones concretas con los indígenas chiriguanos en el terreno. Se examinan luego sus ideas sobre la cultura material como campo experimental privilegiado para rastrear procesos de síntesis de influencias culturales andinas, chaqueñas y amazónicas, así también sus dilemas y límites a la hora de interpretar el factor de la influencia criolla y el proceso de cambio social y cultural en un sentido amplio.

Examining one of the most sought-after – and secretive – graduate professions, the book provides a first-hand account of the boardroom culture of Europe&amp;#39;s strongest economy. Analyzing how knowledge and power operate in this sector, the book explores a number of paradoxes. For example, while it is the job of management consultants to analyse the activities of other employees, they actually spend most of their time in luxurious seclusion away from them. In addition, despite having a strong sense of the importance of their work, consultants often find it difficult to explain to outsiders what it is they do. The book addresses these and other paradoxes by arguing that consultants are engaged in abstract labour. Anthropologists have long struggled with the question of how to describe contemporary work regimes which do not produce anything tangible. Stein demonstrates that elite work is predominantly abstract, in the fourfold sense that it is epistemically removed from the object of analysis, emotionally detached from it, several steps away from the assumed sources of economic value creation, and increasingly hard to grasp. In doing so, he offers new ways to think about white collar work and elites in the 21st century and establishes the notion of &amp;#39;abstract labour&amp;#39; as a key category in social anthropology.Save to Libraryby Felix Stein•  6  Anthropology, Social Anthropology, Political Science, Economic AnthropologyReview of Reframing the Northern Rio Grande Pueblo EconomyReview of Reframing the Northern Rio Grande Pueblo Economy, edited by Scott G.

While the former were created by young activists, whose endeavours were rooted in identifying with particular modes of sociality, work, and local belonging, the latter point to a new systemic interest in youth. This interest - alongside other shifts in spatialization by young people and of them - indicates a historical change in social value ascribed to the youth. This value is founded on an ascribed entrepreneurial ability.Save to LibraryDownloadby Miha Kozorog•  9  Entrepreneurship, Youth Studies, Social and Cultural Anthropology, Economic AnthropologyDebt as a double-edged risk: A historical case from Nahua (Aztec) MexicoDebt is one of the oldest and most widespread social arrangements that humans use to manage hardship—and it has also been one of the riskiest.

David Graeber convincingly makes this case in his recent study of debt over the last five thousand years, but his focus on the Old World leaves open the question of whether similar contradictions emerged among the markets, cities, and states of the Americas. This article uses sixteenth-century documents to reconstruct the practices, institutions, and morality of debt in Nahua society during the Aztec Empire (AD 1428–1521) and show how debt was a double-edged risk in the Aztec economy. Debt played a constructive role, helping some households through hard times and carrying little of the negative moral valence commonly associated with it. However, debts could create new vulnerabilities when secured by selling family members into slavery. Exploitative debt, however, may have only become a problem during economic and environmental crises that made the risks of debt seem less than the risks of other ways to deal with hardship. Without careful attention to cultural context and historical circumstances, generalizations about debt's exploitative aspects are limited in their ability to explain debt's global extent and historical persistence.Save to LibraryDownloadby John  Millhauser•  5  Economic Anthropology, Aztecs, Mesoamerica, MexicoClass, Culture and Practice in the Tanjung Tualang Sikh Settlement: A Study in Critical OntologySave to LibraryDownloadby Charanpal Bal•  4  Economic Anthropology, Class, Malaysia, Sociology of Everyday Life"Libro Azul Británico: Informes de Roger Casement y otras cartas sobre las atrocidades en el Putumayo",  Journal de la Société des Américanistes 99/2: 222-226, 2013.Save to LibraryDownloadby Lorena Córdoba•  44  History, Ethnic Studies, Latin American Studies, AnthropologyIndispensable Consumption.

This chapter is based on a diachronic perspective and interviews with entrepreneurs, workers, trade unionists and institutional representatives of the Valdelsa district between Florence and Siena.  It examines the radically diverging local interpretations of the crisis of the furniture industries during the Nineteen-eighties and the recent market crisis of chassis for motorized caravans. A comparison of the two crises, considering also the  “colonization” of the district by multinational companies, reveals a process of dis-embeddedness of the socio-political dimensions, resulting in a more hierarchical structure of what was once considered a model of socially integrated capitalism.Save to LibraryDownloadby Francesco Zanotelli•  8  Economic Anthropology, Neoliberalism, Pierre Bourdieu, Anthropology of WorkCURSO MAB III CICLO 2017Save to LibraryDownloadby Maria Ilaria Pannaccione Apa•  3  Landscape Archaeology, Economic Anthropology, Peruvian ArchaeologyLa circulacion social de la deuda: codigos culturales y usura rural en Jalisco"About the book: Los resultados de las multiples investigaciones sobre pobreza coinciden en que un porcentaje importante de lo habitantes rurales se mantienen con la cuarta parte de lo que se ha calculado como el nivel minimo requerido... more"About the book:Los resultados de las multiples investigaciones sobre pobreza coinciden en que un porcentaje importante de lo habitantes rurales se mantienen con la cuarta parte de lo que se ha calculado como el nivel minimo requerido para subsistir.
