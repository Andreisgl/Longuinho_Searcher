Proceedings of the goINDIGO2022 international graffiti symposium2023 • Geert J J Verhoeven, Jona Schlegel, Massimiliano CarlonigoINDIGO 2022 has managed to bring various disciplines together. That is why the editors hope that the contributions in these proceedings can collectively be considered a proper methodological status quo on the inventorying and dissemination of graffiti records. Because most academic efforts focus on the analyses of graffiti, these proceedings also hope to kickstart further discussion and interdisciplinary scholarly action on the (need for) proper documentation and dissemination of graffiti. Critical, maybe even uncomfortable, reflections like those vented in this volume form an essential part of this discourse.Download Free PDFView PDFDocument | archive | disseminate graffiti-scapes. Proceedings of the goINDIGO2022 international graffiti symposiumFacing a chameleon—How project INDIGO discovers and records new graffiti2023 • Geert J J Verhoeven, Jona Schlegel, Benjamin WildGraffiti are studied by, amongst many others, archaeologists, sociologists, (art) historians, linguists, ethnographers, architects, anthropologists, librarian scientists, geographers, criminologists, conservators, lawyers and architects. Although most of these professions rely on a digital representation of graffiti at a particular stage of their research, there has been strikingly little attention to how graffiti can effectively be monitored and digitally documented. And this is precisely one of the gaps that the heritage science project INDIGO is trying to fill. Through collaboration between geomatics, photography, data management and graffiti specialists, INDIGO aims to develop technical and logistical solutions that facilitate the systematic documentation, monitoring, and analysis of extensive graffiti-scapes. This paper focuses on the graffiti-discovering and data acquisition strategies INDIGO has been applying during its first project year. At the same time, the text explores new avenues for improving the existing approaches.Download Free PDFView PDFInt. Arch. Photogramm. Remote Sens. Spatial Inf. Sci.Project INDIGO – document, disseminate & analyse a graffiti-scape2022 • Geert J J Verhoeven, Jona Schlegel, Adolfo  Molada Tebar, Alexander Watzinger, Stefan Wogrin, Massimiliano CarloniGraffiti is a short-lived form of heritage balancing between tangible and intangible, offensive and pleasant. Graffiti makes people laugh, wonder, angry, think. These conflicting traits are all present along Vienna's Donaukanal (Eng. Danube Canal), a recreational hotspot – located in the city's heart – famous for its endless display of graffiti. The graffiti-focused heritage science project INDIGO aims to build the basis to systematically document, monitor, and analyse circa 13 km of Donaukanal graffiti in the next decade. The first part of this paper details INDIGO's goals and overarching methodological framework, simultaneously placing it into the broader landscape of graffiti research. The second part of the text concentrates on INDIGO's graffiti documentation activities. Given the project's aim to create a spatially, spectrally, and temporally accurate record of all possible mark-makings attached in (il)legal ways to the public urban surfaces of the Donaukanal, it seems appropriate to provide insights on the photographic plus image-based modelling activities that form the foundation of INDIGO's graffiti recording strategy. The text ends with some envisioned strategies to streamline image acquisition and process the anticipated hundreds of thousands of images.Download Free PDFView PDFHeritageAUTOGRAF—AUTomated Orthorectification of GRAFfiti PhotosBenjamin WildAdmired and despised, created and destroyed, legal and illegal: Contemporary graffiti are polarising, and not everybody agrees to label them as cultural heritage. However, if one is among the steadily increasing number of heritage professionals and academics that value these short-lived creations, their digital documentation can be considered a part of our legacy to future generations. To document the geometric and spectral properties of a graffito, digital photographs seem to be appropriate. This also holds true when documenting an entire graffiti-scape consisting of 1000s of individual creations. However, proper photo-based digital documentation of such an entire scene comes with logistical and technical challenges, certainly if the documentation is considered the basis for further analysis of the heritage assets. One main technical challenge relates to the photographs themselves. Conventional photographs suffer from multiple image distortions and usually lack a uniform scale, whi...Download Free PDFView PDFDocument | archive | disseminate graffiti-scapes. Proceedings of the goINDIGO2022 international graffiti symposium'Different folks, different strokes': goINDIGO 2022's «Creators vs Academics» discussion round2023 • Geert J J Verhoeven, Benjamin Wild, Massimiliano Carloni, Jona SchlegelDuring the first discussion round of goINDIGO 2022, which took place on Thursday, 12 May and was called Creators vs Academics, four local graffiti creators were invited to consider a series of (potentially provocative) statements in discussion with symposium participants (joining in-person and online). The statements, compiled by Geert Verhoeven in consultation with Samuel Merrill, were: * Academia CHANGES graffiti * Graffiti MUST be recorded * ALL graffiti are archive-worthy * Decontextualisation MATTERS * Graffiti NEED categorisation * Digital media are ESSENTIALDownload Free PDFView PDFDocument | archive | disseminate graffiti-scapes. Proceedings of the goINDIGO2022 international graffiti symposiumUrban Creativity Meets Engineering. Automated Graffiti Mapping along Vienna's Donaukanal2023 • Benjamin Wild, Geert J J VerhoevenGraffiti are polarising. Some consider them vandalism, others part of our cultural heritage. If we consider graffiti to be part of our cultural heritage, we should also treat them as such. However, long-term and detailed graffiti documentation initiatives are sparse, so many of the existing archives with graffiti records are biased and incomplete. In addition, graffiti records usually suffer from decontextualisation, that is the lack of environmental information (be it spatially, temporally, but also smell and weather conditions). This means that graffiti documentation might not reflect the intended setting or meaning by the creator. INDIGO, a graffiti-centred academic project, largely overcomes the issue of decontextualisation by designing and implementing photogrammetric engineering approaches that support the ongoing documentation of an extensive graffiti-scape. The latter is situated along the Donaukanal, Vienna's central waterway and one of the most prominent graffiti hotspots worldwide. One innovation developed in the framework of INDIGO is a freely available Metashape add-on called AUTOGRAF. AUTOGRAF employs photogrammetric computer vision techniques to automatically create ortophotographs from all photographed graffiti. Orthophotographs or orthophotomaps are distortion-free images, combining photographs' visual qualities with characteristics of maps. They allow embedding the graffiti in their native, albeit virtual, 3D environment and can thus largely overcome decontextualisation. In this contribution, we showcase the significant advantages of orthophotomaps over conventional photographs and introduce the AUTOGRAF-based workflow that allows the automated derivation of graffiti orthophotos. INDIGO will use this tailor-made tool to enable graffiti analysis in unprecedented detail by mapping and displaying graffiti in their original setting along the Donaukanal.Download Free PDFView PDFDocument | archive | disseminate graffiti-scapes. Proceedings of the goINDIGO2022 international graffiti symposiumMaking a mark—Towards a graffiti thesaurus2023 • Jona Schlegel, Massimiliano Carloni, Geert J J VerhoevenWhat does it mean to create graffiti? What exactly is (or are) graffiti? Graffiti and street art differ, right? Almost everyone has an opinion on what constitutes (modern) graffiti. Consequently, the term has taken on the most varied meanings in the conversations of academics, in media coverage, or in daily life. So how can one be sure about the meaning of the term (or any graffiti-related term, for that matter)? This is why glossaries, dictionaries, and other types of lists with definitions exist on websites, at the beginning or end of coffee-table books, and in scientific articles. However, there is currently no generally available, updateable, broadly accepted and easy-to-expand list of graffiti-related terms. Therefore, in order to meet the need for systematisation and consistency required for a more comprehensive study of graffiti, project INDIGO embarked on the journey to create a graffiti thesaurus. Being a finite set of terms (i.e. a controlled vocabulary) with hierarchical relations, this thesaurus will make INDIGO's graffiti classification explicit and hopes to serve as a reference for the broader (academic) graffiti community.Download Free PDFView PDFDocument | archive | disseminate graffiti-scapes.
