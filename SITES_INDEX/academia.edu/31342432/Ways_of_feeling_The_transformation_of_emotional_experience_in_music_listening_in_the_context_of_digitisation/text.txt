I have conducted a cyberethnography of Internet users and perform a language analysis of their experiences. I synthesise this approach with the field of somatechnics, in order to understand the body as always-already positioned in relation to the techno-social schema.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersScreen as Skin: The Somatechnics of Touchscreen Music MediaLaura GlitsosIn this article I explore the way mobile music devices with touchscreen technology produce new somatechnical figurations that reshape emotional dynamics of music listening. Using research drawn from a cyberethnography of online users from Reddit.com, I argue that the changing relationships between the human-computer interface result in new affective schemas that expand and reconfigure how it feels to listen to music in a mobile setting. In particular, I focus on skin-on-screen contact in order to suggest that the screen acts as a reflexive surface producing intimate relations for the mobile listener. Touchscreens imply the relationship between skin on skin—the skin of our body (in particular the hands) against the skin of the screen. It follows that mobile touchscreen devices suggest a degree of sensuality—in the coming together of bodies, fluids and other organic materials which ‘stick’ to the touchscreen. Reading the mobile touchscreen player as a somatechnical figuration therefore suggests that the listening experience is developing along with the technologies that mediate music to the body in ways that continue to challenge our understanding of bodily borders and in ways that redefine what it means to feel the music. Therefore, the touchscreen-skin is a critical site of affective relations that dramatically reshape what it means to listening to music in a mobile setting; a private and intimate encounter between the user and their counterpart.Download Free PDFView PDFMusic Sound and the Moving ImageThe Camera Phone in the Concert Space: Live Music and Moving Images on the Screen2018 • Laura GlitsosIn this article, I argue that screen relations have profoundly redirected affective and aesthetic strategies of live music experience to culminate in a complex relationship with camera phone technology that is charac- terised by feelings of possessiveness, a sense of control over narrativising one’s experience, and new sentiments towards concert community. I examine the ways in which the camera phone produces new and alternative viewing pleasures because of the way the technology can structure new narratives of the concert experience. However, I note the conflicting, and at times very negative sentiments, emerging from the ubiquity of the camera phone. In particular, I examine the disruption of social viewing practices by those holding up the device or by the brightness of the display that distracts other viewers from the stage, as well as the ways in which the camera phone has been constructed in popular discourse as a technology which detracts from living experience ‘in the moment’.Download Free PDFView PDF"Introduction: Listening Through the Body"Laura GlitsosIntroductory Chapter Explains how the book: Synthesizes the emerging practice and field of somatechnics with popular music studies Presents the first approach of its kind to popular music consumption and listening practices through the body-emotion perspective Investigates the complex inter-relationships between technologies and music, and how these impact the listening experience as mediated by the body-systemDownload Free PDFView PDFMusicology ResearchLoydell, Rupert & Marshall, Kingsley. (2017) 'Sound Mirrors: Brian Eno and Touchscreen Generative Music'. In Musicology Research. Issue 3, Autumn, 2017. No. 2, pp. 27-50.2017 • Kingsley  MarshallWith the recent publication of the edited collection Brian Eno: Oblique Music (Albiez & Pattie, 2016) and the distribution of Brian Eno’s 26th solo studio album Reflection in 2017 on vinyl, CD and as an innovative software application, the time is ripe for a reconsideration of the way in which software has been used by the musician, composer, record producer and visual artist Brian Eno. This paper explores how Eno has used simple but innovative ideas and processes to inform his music over the course of his career, and considers how his work with collaborators – specifically the musician and software designer Peter Chilvers – has converged with the emergence of touchscreen technologies and modes of distribution. We will demonstrate how Apple’s App Store global distribution platform has further disseminated Eno’s ideas of ‘generative music’ to a wider audience through he and Chilvers’ Bloom (2008), Trope (2009/2015), Scape (2012) and Reflection (2017a) software applications for Apple’s iPhone and iPad, and the impact on the distribution and reception of Eno’s own music. Echoing Eno’s own processes of appropriation, remix and collaboration the authors wrote the paper through exchanges dictated by the turn of a card selected from the third edition of the Oblique Strategies deck, issued by Eno and Peter Schmidt in 1979.Download Free PDFView PDFVaporwave, or music optimised for abandoned mallsLaura GlitsosIn this article I focus on the genre of 'vaporwave', using the artist 18 Carat Affair as a case study, to explore the way the genre works as a project that produces, and takes pleasure in, a kind of 'memory play'. As a genre, vaporwave is a style of music collaged together from a wide variety of largely background musics such as muzak ® , 1980s elevator music and new age ambience. Vaporwave's 'memory play' is a project that takes remembering as its audiovisual aesthetic. The pleasure of vaporwave is therefore understood as a pleasure of remembering for the sake of the act of remembering itself. To explore this theme, I examine vaporwave's memory play using the terms of Chris Healy's 'compen-satory nostalgia', as well as the idea of 'ersatz nostalgia' as discussed by Arjun Appadurai and Svetlana Boym.Download Free PDFView PDFScoring without Scoresese: Nollywood's Divergent Creative ProcessPeter PianoThe Nigerian film industry (Nollywood) embraces both motion picture and television approaches; yet it cannot be called one or the other in its entirety. This ‘both and neither’ nature has forced scholars such as Kenneth Harrow to ask: ‘how are we to read their films?’ and, by virtue of this article, their film music. I argue that the capacity to do so subsists in a thorough understanding of the industry’s organisation and long-held divergent creative process. My ethnographic study reveals that Nollywood’s structure of film music production differs significantly from some other known cinema traditions of the world. One such striking observation is that Nollywood film music projects and production (recording, editing, spotting, etc.) are entirely carried out without the involvement of film directors. And this unique process and structure strongly influences its film music approaches and aesthetics. This paper, thus, presents and examines those differences with a view to offering insights on how Nollywood film music might be understood.Download Free PDFView PDFResearch analysis of trend and developments of the vinyl record within the music market in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern IrelandDissertation Sara-Lena Probst2014 • Sara-Lena ProbstDownload Free PDFView PDFProceedings of A Body of Knowledge - Embodied Cognition and the Arts conference CTSA UCI 8-10 Dec 2016Musical Worlds and the Extended Mind2018 • Joel KruegerDownload Free PDFView PDF2016_Media, Communication and Nostalgia_media&time.pdfManuel MenkeCo-edited special issue of media&time "Media, Communication and Nostalgia" with 10 articles: (1) Manuel Menke & Christian Schwarzenegger: Media, Communication and Nostalgia - Finding a better tomorrow in the yesterday?----- (2) Ekaterina Kalinina: What Do We Talk About When We Talk About Media and Nostalgia?----- (3) Steffen Lepa & Vlasis Tritakis: Not Every Vinyl Retromaniac is a Nostalgic - A social experiment on the pleasures of record listening in the digital age.----- (4) Lynne Hibberd & Zoë Tew-Thompson: Hills, Old People, and Sheep - Reflections of Holmfirth as the Summer Wine town.----- (5) Jakob Hörtnagl: “Why?
