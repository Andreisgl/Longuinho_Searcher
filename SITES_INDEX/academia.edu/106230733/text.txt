The “Mayor’s Office of New Urban Mechanics” (MONUM) in Boston, Massachusetts (USA) proves a representative case of innovation in the public sector. As a new type of government agency, it is essentially an open innovation lab dedicated to innovative evidence-based policymaking. Following a new dynamic organizational pattern in urban governance, MONUM is conducive to project-oriented social innovation practices and horizontal multi-sectoral collaboration among the three societal sectors: public, private, and civil. Its results suggest that first, the peculiarity of MONUM lies in its hybrid and boundary-blurring nature. Second, new institutional forms that experiment with urban governance can rely on multi-sectoral collaboration. Third, MONUM has experimented with a systemic approach to social innovation following the “design thinking theory.” The MON...See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersLecture Notes in Geoinformation and CartographySmart Cities: Concepts, Perceptions and Lessons for Planners2015 • Joseph FerreiraDownload Free PDFView PDFSustainabilityDefinitions Matter: Dynamic Policy Framing of the Arts in Boston’s Sustainable Cultural DevelopmentMargaret WyszomirskiCultural sustainability has become a fourth pillar in sustainable development studies. Different from the research approach to embedding culture into conventional sustainable discourse, this article argues that the sustainability and resilience issues within the arts and cultural sector should be paid more attention to. Putting the arts and cultural sector in urban settings, sustainable cultural development entails dynamic policy framing and changing policy justifications in response to an evolving socioeconomic and political environment. Taking the policy framing of the arts as an analytical lens, this paper aims to investigate this dynamic change and key driving factors through an in-depth case study of Boston’s urban cultural development. This article finds that different definitions of the arts are associated with different arts-based urban development strategies across four stages of cultural development in Boston spanning a period of over 75 years. The working definition moved...Download Free PDFView PDFBig Data and Smart (Equitable) CitiesMai T NguyenElected officials and bureaucrats claim that Big Data is dramatically changing city hall by allowing more efficient and effective decision-making. This has sparked a rise in the number of " Offices of Innovation " that collect, manage, use and share Big Data, in major cities throughout the U.S. This paper seeks to answer two questions. First, is Big Data changing how decisions are made in city hall? Second, is Big Data being used to address social equity and how? This study examines Offices of Innovation that use Big Data in five major American cities: New York, Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia, and Louisville, focusing specifically on three dimensions of Big Data and social equity: data democratization, digital access and literacy, and promoting equitable outcomes. Furthermore, this study highlights innovative practices that address social problems in order to provide directions for future research and practice on the topic of Big Data and social equity.Download Free PDFView PDFSmart CitiesAre Smart Innovation Ecosystems Really Seeking to Meet Citizens’ Needs? Insights from the Stakeholders’ Vision on Smart City Strategy ImplementationTerrence FernandoThe concept of a smart city is becoming the leading paradigm worldwide. Consequently, a creative mix of emerging technologies and open innovation is gradually becoming the defining element of smart city evolution, changing the ways in which city administrators are organizing their services and development globally. Thus, the smart city concept is becoming extremely relevant on the agendas of policy-makers as a development strategy for enhancing the quality of life of the citizen and improving the sustainability goals of their cities. Despite of the relevance of the topic, still few studies investigate how open innovation shapes the way cities become smarter or focus on the experiences of professionals to understand the concept of a smart city and its implementation. This paper fills this gap and analyzes the processes for building effective smart cities by integrating the different perspectives of smart innovations and using the core components of smart cities according to a concept...Download Free PDFView PDFSSRN Electronic JournalSmart City or Smart Citizens?

It discusses how the macro-innovation eco-ecosystem is composed by a variety of interconnected micro-innovation eco-systems, mutually reinforcing each other and making the entire &quot;territorial&quot; system successful. The spatial configuration of these micro-innovation ecosystems at the urban scale has been specifically investigated, thus leading to theorize that the Innovation District may act as enabler for place-based innovation. Evidence from the Boston case study shows that there is not a single magic recipe for the successful implementation of place-based and social innovation-driven strategies. On the contrary, the variety of place-grounded combinations of micro and macro initiatives, embedded in the social and spatial fine grain of places and encompassing a diversity of actors, can create the conditions enabling places to thrive...Download Free PDFView PDFi-teams: The teams and funds making innovation happen in governments around the worldRuth PuttickThis report tells the stories of 20 teams, units and funds established by governments and charged with making innovation happen. They work across the spectrum of innovation – from focusing on incremental improvements to aiming for radical transformations. Key findings All governments need institutions to catalyse innovation. The best mayors and ministers recognise this and put in place i-teams, dedicated teams, units and funds, to structure and embed innovation methods and practice in government. Based on our analysis, i-teams fall into one of four categories: creating solutions to solve specific challenges, engaging citizens, non-profits and businesses to find new ideas, transforming the processes, skills and culture of government, or achieving wider policy and systems change. They are overcoming a range of issues, from reducing murder rates, making it easier to register a business, improving school performance, to booting economic growth. Drawing on desk research, site visits, over 80 interviews, and a survey to analyse twenty i-teams from across six continents, the report reveals that innovation requires dedicated capacity, specific skills, methods, partnerships, and consistent political support. The study shows the ways in which these elements have been combined successfully to achieve impressive results. We have created a set of 10 recommendations for other government leaders to learn from and to emulate these efforts. Governments have pioneered some of the greatest innovations in modern history. Driven by entrepreneurial and visionary leadership, city and national governments are capable of amazing things. But while governments can be pioneering and innovative, they can also struggle to find the space and time to invest in the future when they are responsible for delivering the services that people rely on today. Smart political leadership recognises this tendency and creates the structures, capabilities and space needed to allow innovation to happen. These are the i-teams: the innovation teams, units and funds that are helping transform governments around the world. - See more at: http://www.nesta.org.uk/publications/i-teams-teams-and-funds-making-innovation-happen-governments-around-world#sthash.dw0eNm7q.dpufDownload Free PDFView PDFInternational Journal of Advanced Engineering Research and Science (IJAERS)Smart City in Urban Innovation: Concept, Management, Policy and Technology2021 • Dr. A H M E D YounusThis article defines a smart city not as a measure of how smart a city is, but as an endeavour to become innovative. The meaning attached to a smart city is innovative in terms of administration, policy, and technology. Because each city's distinct setting influences its technical, organizational, and policy elements, we may think of smart cities as a contextualized interaction of technical, managerial, and policy innovation. However, there is a dearth of study on innovation in Management and policy, despite the abundant literature on technological innovation. After reviewing the public management literature, the author concluded that urban planning is a critical component of urban growth. Cities with sufficient intellectual resources, established institutions, and developed infrastructure are smart cities. The purpose of this exposition is to analyze the smart city's function in urban administration. The research establishes a link between coverage planning and investment pressure zones. The author's categorization of Medium-Size Cities is the primary outcome. The purpose of this article is to close a research gap by developing a complete framework for seeing the smart city movement as an invention that encompasses technology, Management, and policy. Additionally, we explore the inherent dangers of innovation, innovative techniques while avoiding risks, and the settings in which innovation and risks occur.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
