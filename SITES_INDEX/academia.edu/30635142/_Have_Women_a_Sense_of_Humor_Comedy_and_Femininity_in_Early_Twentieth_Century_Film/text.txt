(Coquelin 67). More than one hundred years later, Vanity Fair published an article explaining "Why Women Aren't Funny" (Hitchens 54). These articles are part of a larger debate about women's capacity to engage in and appreciate humor that has existed for many years and represent traces of a long-standing prejudice in American culture against women performing comedy, a prejudice that has a ected women's comic expression in every form and forum. Public debates about whether women have a sense of humor and the nature of women's humor date to at least the nineteenth century and clearly continue to this day. Countless writers and critics have argued that femininity and a sense of humor are mutually exclusive and that women's "natural" inclination toward emotion and sensitivity has left them incapable of possessing a quality-humor-that many feel is dependent on "masculine" traits such as intellect and...See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersResearching Women in Silent Cinema: New Findings and PerspectivesSilent Comediennes and “The Tragedy of Being Funny”2013 • Kristen Anderson WagnerDownload Free PDFView PDFHorton/A Companion to Film ComedyPie Queens and Virtuous Vamps2012 • Kristen Anderson WagnerDownload Free PDFView PDFMovie Prologues: Cinema, Theater and Female Types on Stage at Cinelândia, Rio de JaneiroLuciana Correa de AraújoDownload Free PDFView PDFDAR, University of BolognaResearching Women in Silent Cinema: New Findings and Perspectives2013 • Monica Dall'AstaDownload Free PDFView PDFCINEJ Cinema JournalKristen Anderson WagnerDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Cinema and Media StudiesJCMS Review: "Specters of Slapstick and Silent Film Comediennes by Maggie Hennefeld, and: Comic Venus: Women and Comedy in American Silent Film by Kristen Anderson Wagner" (by Linda Mizejewski)2019 • Maggie  HennefeldTwo groundbreaking studies demonstrate feminist film theory’s continuing fascination with silent cinema’s female bodies. We see in these books—Maggie Hennefeld’s 'Specters of Slapstick and Silent Film Comediennes' and Kristen Anderson Wagner’s 'Comic Venus: Women and Comedy in American Silent Film'—the ongoing feminist project of restoring the “vanished” women performers of the silent film era to our histories.Download Free PDFView PDFA Companion to Film Comedy 2012Teguh AryawangsaDownload Free PDFView PDFNot so Silent: Women in Cinema Before Sound2010 • Sofia Bull"The work of the Women and the Silent Screen Conferences [...] is to collectively create a new realm of cinema history, neither 'the' history, nor 'a' history, but a strange double world." These words are from Jane Gaines in her keynote address for the fifth Women and the Silent Screen Conference, held at the Stockholm University in 2008. This proceedings volume gives a representative picture of the breadth of the conference. The rich and varied contributions address theoretical issues around this double world of "cinematification" and feminist historiography, advancing questions on the authorship of pioneering female filmmakers and the role of female stars in early cinema. Other topics explored include transnationalism, the performance of femininity, fandom and fashioning, and branding within the studio system. The diversity of subjects in this volume reveals both the complexity and the problems of the field of research that the Women and the Silent Screen Conferences represent. Not only do these papers deal with well-known, concrete issues within feminist scholarship, but they also consider a more fundamental question: that of the medium as such in its early years, and its conceptualisation within a feminist scholarly framework."Download Free PDFView PDFNot so Silent: Women in Cinema before Sound Stockholm Studies in Film HistoryEngaging National Emotions on Screen: European Silent Women in ’Strikingly Effective’ MelodramasDominique  NastaDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Cinema and Media StudiesKristen Anderson WagnerDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
