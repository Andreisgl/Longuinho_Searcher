Twenty-five years later, Ehud Kalai and Meir Smorodinsky gave a different solution replacing the IIA condition with their own Monotonicity condition. While the two solutions obviously coincide under certain conditions (e.g. when the problem is symmetric), they do not in general agree. This paper presents a complete account of the precise conditions under which the two solutions coincide.Save to Libraryby Todd  Stambaugh•  3  Bargaining, Bargaining Theory, Nash BargainingA Block-Based Gradient Descent Search Algorithm for Block Motion Estimation In Video Coding[15] G.
