Requirements
Request in Meta-Wiki (rejected)
This test has a valid language code, but note that it is an extinct, historical or ancient language so it will be hard to get a Wikimedia project.
Even if this test has a valid language code, it was rejected by the Language Committee. See link just above.

Your interface language is "English" (en). If you are an anonymous user, you can log in / create an account. If you are a registered user, you can change your interface language.
Test version was deleted after Meta rejected the request, based on likelihood of copyright violation (and possibility that some or all of the test was actually in modern tr‑Arab, rather than ota). Because of the likely copyright violation, an archive file was not created. For more information, please contact the administrators. StevenJ81 (talk) 15:31, 5 December 2018 (UTC)Reply[reply]
