But right now, you probably feel nervous just scanning this book. That’s okay. I think anyone who’s ever attended my fearful flier workshops felt nervous, even panicky, when they got the e-mail reminding them the group was about to start. Just thinking about it could make their hearts race, palms sweat, chests tighten, and breathing become labored and uncomfortable. Then all the scary thoughts they usually have about flying would flood their mind. They’d start having nervous thoughts about being the most frightened person in the group, and think they should back out. Don’t be fooled by those thoughts. If you’re afraid of flying and start thinking of flying for any reason, you’ll probably experience some fear. I’m going to help you with that. For now, if you find yourself struggling against that fear, turn your attention back to these words for a few minutes without trying to control what you feel: You don’t have to feel calm to read—you can let that develop over time. In this book, I’ll show you an approach to aviophobia, the fear of flying, that will help you start flying again if you’ve stopped entirely. Or, if you still fly, but with increasing dread and difficulty, you’ll be able to approach flying in a new way, one that gradually relieves and diminishes the anxiety you feel before and during each flight. As a clinical psychologist who has specialized in helping people overcome all kinds of fears and phobias since 1990, my methods combine elements of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with a variety of acceptance-based methods, principally derived from acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). I’ve written books about various aspects of anxiety, have maintained a popular self-help website at AnxietyCoach.com since 2000, and offered training about fears and phobias to thousands of professional therapists in the US and abroad. I’m confident you can take some big steps in the next 30 days. It may be hard for you to believe that this problem can be overcome, or that you can take your first practice flight so soon. This is a very common reaction. However, I know it’s true because I’ve seen many people do it. When I first started offering my workshop for fearful fliers in 1993, the groups met once a week for four weeks, and then we’d take a flight together. In the last few years, I’ve conducted the workshop in a single weekend, with the flight on a Sunday afternoon. Both ways have been very effective, and these groups have included a lot of people who hadn’t flown for 10 years or more. More than 600 people have attended the workshops, and all but five of them have taken the flights. So, taking one month to started addressing your fear is a reasonable time-frame. Take more time if you choose to. It’s not a race. One out of every six people fears flying. It is a solvable problem, and yet, people often have a lot of trouble solving it. They often struggle in fear and frustration for years. The reason people have so much trouble overcoming this problem isn’t because it’s so difficult, nor because these people are defective. It’s because the Panic Trick fools them into opposing their fear with methods that they hope will help, but that actually make their fear stronger and more durable. I’m going to help you discover how this works, how it may have prevented you from solving the problem of fear, and above all, how you can solve it and travel as you see fit. For now, I’ll just say that this fear is a counterintuitive problem, and when you use intuitive responses with a counterintuitive problem, that makes it worse rather than better. In this book, I’ll help you develop better responses. I’m going to assume that you have the same goal as all the fearful fliers I’ve worked with; namely, you want to be able to fly on commercial airlines whenever it serves your purposes. You want to be a passenger. This is a book for people who want to be passengers. Whether you want to overcome this fear in order to fly for business purposes, or because you’re at a point in life when you have the time and money to travel and you want to see more of the world, or because you’re preparing for college and don’t want to limit your options to nearby schools, it’s all doable. I’ll show you how to treat this problem in ways that actually do make it more manageable. You’ll learn how to use the same techniques we use in my fearful flier workshop. This will enable you to join the ranks of former flight-phobics who can now travel by airplane whenever they wish. Sound scary? Of course it does! That’s because you’re afraid of flying. If you were afraid of dogs (or spiders), and I was writing about approaching dogs (or spiders), you’d feel afraid as well. That’s what this book is for. Take it a step at a time, and I think you’ll find that you’ll regain the ability to fly and travel freely. A note about using this book: I’m going to periodically ask you to answer questions, try an experiment, or engage in some task before you continue reading. Some readers prefer to read first and do the exercises later. Others will do the exercises as they come to them, in the order I present. Both methods are okay. But there are two good reasons to do each exercise or task as soon as you reach it in the book, rather than putting it off. The first reason is that it’s very important to do the exercises. And you’re more likely to do them all if you simply go ahead and do each one as you come to them, rather than putting them off or waiting for a better time. You don’t have to do it this way; you can wait if you want, but some of the people who postpone the exercises will probably not get back to them. And if you read the book but don’t do the exercises, you probably won’t get much out of it. Therefore, you can increase your chances of a good outcome by responding to each exercise as it arises. The second reason is that I’m going to mention common answers and reactions to the questions and experiments, and it will be more useful for you to record your own answers before you read the answers of other people. So, you can do it either way, but my suggestion is to just tackle each question and exercise when you come to it. Before we begin, here are three definitions you might find useful. Fear: a strong expectation of future danger, which usually produces anxiety. Anxiety: an emotion characterized by feelings of tension, worried thoughts, and physical changes, like increased blood pressure. Phobia: a fear of a specific situation, object, activity, or other cue that is disproportionate to the probability of potential harm it contains, accompanied by a persistent pattern of avoidance and self-protective responses. Ready to get started? You may be having the thought that you should wait for a better time, when you feel less nervous. Don’t be fooled by that thought! Postponing will actually prolong the problem, while engaging with it can lead to a solution. If you’re afraid of flying, thinking and reading about flying will make you nervous at first. If you’re going to solve this problem, you’ll feel some fear along the way. Trying not to be afraid is how you remain phobic, not how you overcome it. You will feel some fear as you read this and work on it, and that will be okay. In fact, working with that fear, rather than against it, is how you will overcome this problem and regain your freedom to fly whenever and wherever it meets your needs. Good luck with the program. If you ever see me at the airport, be sure to say hello! CHAPTER 1 What Do You Fear About Flying? Think back to a time when you were on board an airplane waiting for takeoff, and you felt very afraid. Pretend I could have spoken to you at that moment and that you were willing to talk briefly with me. Let’s suppose I asked you, What do you fear will happen to you on this flight? How would you have answered me at that moment? Don’t tell me what you think now. Tell me what you feared then, in the moments before takeoff. Don’t try to dress up your fear to make it seem more realistic or reasonable. No one else has to see your answer if you don’t want them to. Just state, simply and concretely, what you feared was going to happen to you when you flew on that airplane, regardless of how realistic or unrealistic that fear seems to you right now. People are often a little vague in their first answers. They often say things like doom and losing control and being trapped. So be as specific as you can. If you feared doom, what form did you think that doom would take, and what would it do to you? If you feared losing control, what out-of-control things did you think you might do? If you feared being trapped, what did you fear would happen to you in that trap? Two Types of Feared Outcomes The previous question is the first one I ask fearful fliers. They typically answer with one of two very different feared outcomes. The Type 1 feared outcome is about the plane crashing and killing the passengers. In my experience, about one third of fearful fliers report this feared outcome. They’re not afraid of flying, they’re afraid of crashing, at least as they first report it. They often go on to explain that they’re less afraid of death itself than they are of the fear and stress they imagine they would experience while the plane is about to crash. They think about that a lot, repeatedly imagining what they think it would be like. They even think about how unfair it would be, how irritated they would become, if they went through all the trouble to overcome their fears just to die in a plane crash and never even get an apology from all the friends and family who mocked their fears! People who fear crashing spend a lot of time anticipating a doomed flight and feeling afraid as they experience the anticipation. They are literally afraid of feeling afraid. Most members of the public who are not afraid of flying tend to believe that crashing is what all fearful fliers fear. It usually doesn’t occur to them that the fear could be anything other than crashing and dying. However, this is not the fear of the majority of fearful fliers. Again, only about one third of the participants in my workshop have reported this Type 1 feared outcome over the years, and this is roughly the percentage reported by past studies of fear of flying. The Type 2 feared outcome is quite different and doesn’t have anything to do with airplane safety. People with this fear worry that they will become so afraid during the flight that they’ll suffer some terrible consequence as a result of their fear. They think of the airplane not as a vehicle that will rapidly take them to their destination, but as some kind of trap from which escape is impossible. They’re afraid of how they imagine the confinement in the airplane will affect them. This kind of fear is very similar to claustrophobia, a fear of being confined in a small space without means of escape. A person with claustrophobia might become very afraid, for instance, if they have to get an MRI scan done on some part of their body. This generally requires that they lie down in a dark, closed tube.
