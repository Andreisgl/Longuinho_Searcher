The status of women in Bangladesh remained considerably inferior to that of men. Women, in custom and practice, remained subordinate to men in almost all aspects of their lives; Most women’s lives remained centered on their traditional roles, and they had limited access to markets, productive services, education, health care, and local government.(National women development policy-2011). Newspaper of Bangladesh reflects its custom, social cultural activity. Women’s are part of it as Bangladesh lies under democracy. As newspaper consists news, views and gives education, fact and entertainment. So both content of women and man is equally needed. On the other hand the reader of the newspaper is all ages, races and gender. The main object of this study is to identifying how women’s picture and news are being portrayed in national Newspaper.Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of Applied Journalism and Media StudiesUnpacking overload: Examining the impact of content characteristics and news topics on news overload2019 • Avery Holton, Angela M LeeThe proliferation of digital media has provided the public with an abundance of information and pathways to engage with that information. Alongside the opportunities offered by this wealth of content exist feelings of, and worries over, news and information overload. Research has indicated that to respond to this issue, some news consumers proactively scan the news. When such activity fails, or in some cases before it ever begins, other news consumers disconnect from the news altogether. Through a non-random online survey, this study advances empirical understandings of the news overload and individuals' responses to that overload by proposing a more holistic way to measure news overload. By examining the ways in which content characteristics and news topics influence individuals' feelings of overload and how scanning or avoidance of and from the news may result, this study finds that information overload, and news overload more specifically, can be connected to the characteristics of news content and the topic of coverage.Download Free PDFView PDFSanchar Shri, Lucknow University, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, INDIAAnalysis of rural and developmental content in Indian television news2006 • Dev Vrat Singh, Ph.D.Television news channels in India do not cover rural population adequately. The issues related to development like education, health, electricity, water, food, agriculture, infrastructure, unemployment and poverty do not feature in their preference. In place of representing whole nation proportionally television channels actually project country only as ‘urban Indian middle class’. This is highly questionable especially when ‘democratic media’ is operating in a developing country like India. Television reporters do cover villages only when some sensational event like heinous crime, accident or natural calamity occurs. Television news lacks positive reporting from rural India. This paper is an effort to discuss the issue of diversity in media news content in specific context to the coverage of vast rural population. It has been argued that how market forces are dictating news people in framing their news values. How our ‘national channels’ have been reduced to become metro channels.Download Free PDFView PDFSocialized for news media use: How family communication, information-processing needs, and gratifications determine adolescents’ exposure to newsSebastián ValenzuelaAdolescence is a key period in the development of individuals’ news habits, but little is known about the processes involved in the process of news media socialization. This study proposes an integrated model in which the influence of family communication on motivations and behaviors of adolescents in relation to news consumption occurs through the development of personality traits related to information processing (namely, need for cognition and need to evaluate). Structural equation modeling of data from a representative survey of 2,273 adolescents, ages 13 to 17, provide support for the theorized model, such that concept-oriented communication within families is associated to news exposure indirectly, via personality traits and motivations. Thus, the study provides an initial assessment of one way children are socialized to become news enthusiasts and news avoiders. It also provides empirical evidence that information-processing traits are influenced by family communication patterns, confirming what hitherto was theoretical speculation.Download Free PDFView PDFOnline news channels selection and usemefolere kehindeDownload Free PDFView PDFConstruction of the image of politics in Spanish TV news programmes.

The text analyses the influence between this perception and news consumption (“news internalising”) and sharing (“news externalising”). Uses & Gratifications sought (“information seeking”, “social interaction” and “impression management”) were considered as moderating variables. Survey based results (n = 96) show that ‘News Finds Me’ perception is positively correlated with news internalising but not with news externalising. It is thus concluded that the mere presence of the ‘News Finds Me’ perception does not encourage news sharing attitudes. The study also brings evidence to support a relationship between news internalising and news externalising habits, which influence each other mutually and can moderate other factors in news consumption and dissemination on social media. It is concluded that the presence of the ‘News Finds Me’ perception does not encourage news sharing attitudes.Download Free PDFView PDFSociological ForumProcessing Culture: Cognition, Ontology, and the News Media2010 • Stephen OstertagDownload Free PDFView PDF(2013) Delving into the Discourse: Approaches to News Values in Journalism Studies and BeyondHelen CapleIn this report we provide a cross-disciplinary overview of the ways in which news values have been and can be studied.
