The Wikimedia Foundation's fundraiser from 16 December 2006-15 January 2007 succeeded in raising just more than US$1 million. The first three graphs on this page show the day-by-day progress of the fundraiser in terms of total donations, across all currencies, up through 10 January 2007. First, average donation size is shown; second, the number of donations; and third, the total USD value of all donations. The second set of three graphs show analogous information, disaggregated by currency. The vertical red line in each figure marks the first day of the fundraiser; and to make patterns clearer, the large matching contributions are not included here.
