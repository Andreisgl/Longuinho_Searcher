To date, four parasitoids have been introduced in North America for EAB biological control, including the egg parasitoid Oobius agrili Zhang & Huang (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae). Monitoring EAB egg parasitism is challenging because female beetles oviposit in bark crevices and EAB eggs and O. agrili are small (&lt;1 mm in diameter). Consequently, multiple methods have been developed to recover this parasitoid. Here we compared two methods, visual surveys and bark sifting, used to monitor establishment of O. agrili in Maryland, USA. From 2009 to 2015, a total of 56,176 O. agrili were released at 32 sites across the state. In 2016, we surveyed nine of the study sites for O. agrili establishment using both methods. We compared the amount of time spent searching for eggs separately in each method, and also analyzed the effects of years-post re...Download Free PDFView PDFEmerald ash borer biological control2011 • Jian DuanDownload Free PDFView PDFFlorida EntomologistEvaluating a New Method for Monitoring the Field Establishment and Parasitism of Oobius agrili (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae), an Egg Parasitoid of Emerald Ash Borer (Coleoptera: Buprestidae)2014 • Jian DuanDownload Free PDFView PDFForestsProgress and Challenges of Protecting North American Ash Trees from the Emerald Ash Borer Using Biological ControlLeah BauerDownload Free PDFView PDFForest Health Technology Enterprise TeamCitizen science project leads to emerald ash borer parasitoid discovery2009 • Leah BauerAn “EAB in the Classroom” curriculum is being developed based on a project with 7th and 8th grade advanced science students who studied EAB at their 15 ha school forest at Dempsey Middle School, Delaware, OH. EAB was discovered in an adjacent woodlot in 2005. Students established monitoring plots in 2006. In December 2007, one ash tree from each plot (selected as the ash tree closest to plot center in the 3-18 cm DBH size range, for a total of 35 trees) was felled and the trunk was cut into 1 m segments.
