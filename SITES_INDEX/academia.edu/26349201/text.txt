Spectral vegetation indices are among the most widely used satellite data products providing key measurements for climate, hydrologic, and biogeochemical studies; phenology, land cover and land cover change detection; natural resource management and sustainable development.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersThe Development of Vegetation Indices: a Short Overview2019 • Robert RomvariVegetation indices computed from remote sensing data became key components of agricultural monitoring and assessment. With the help of these indices, the difference of vegetational and other land covers can be contrasted and many useful and applicable data can be gathered ranging from vegetation health to growth dynamics among others. In recent decades, starting from the first Landsat satellite, a huge number of VIs were developed in order to be able to effectively monitor vegetation – the reason for the immense number is due to the fact that every sensor, topographic, geographic, vegetative and atmospheric feature is different, and more so are their combinations. This is the reason why there is no unified spectral band mathematical formula. The aim of this short overview is to provide the reader insight of the main vegetation indices (VIs) that have been used in scientific literature and their development over the last 40 years.Download Free PDFView PDFRemote Sensing of EnvironmentOverview of the radiometric and biophysical performance of the MODIS vegetation indices2002 • lais ferreiraDownload Free PDFView PDFRemote Sensing ReviewsA review of vegetation indices1995 • Alfredo HueteDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Plant PhysiologyWide Dynamic Range Vegetation Index for Remote Quantification of Biophysical Characteristics of Vegetation2004 • Anatoly  GitelsonThe Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is widely used for monitoring, analyzing, and mapping temporal and spatial distributions of physiological and biophysical characteristics of vegetation. It is well documented that the NDVI approaches saturation asymptotically under conditions of moderate-to-high aboveground biomass. While reflectance in the red region (ρred) exhibits a nearly flat response once the leaf area index (LAI) exceeds 2, the near infrared (NIR) reflectance (ρNIR) continue to respond significantly to changes in moderate-to-high vegetation density (LAI from 2 to 6) in crops. However, this higher sensitivity of the ρNIR has little effect on NDVI values once the ρNIR exceeds 30 %. In this paper a simple modification of the NDVI was proposed. The Wide Dynamic Range Vegetation Index, WDRVI = (a * ρNIR-ρred)/(a * ρNIR+ρred), where the weighting coefficient a has a value of 0.1–0.2, increases correlation with vegetation fraction by linearizing the relationship for typical wheat, soybean, and maize canopies. The sensitivity of the WDRVI to moderate-to-high LAI (between 2 and 6) was at least three times greater than that of the NDVI. By enhancing the dynamic range while using the same bands as the NDVI, the WDRVI enables a more robust characterization of crop physiological and phenological characteristics. Although this index needs further evaluation, the linear relationship with vegetation fraction and much higher sensitivity to change in LAI will be especially valuable for precision agriculture and monitoring vegetation status under conditions of moderate-to-high density. It is anticipated that the new index will complement the NDVI and other vegetation indices that are based on the red and NIR spectral bands.Download Free PDFView PDFArticle Calibration of a Species-Specific Spectral Vegetation Index for Leaf Area Index (LAI) Monitoring: Example with MODIS Reflectance Time-Series on Eucalyptus Plantations2016 • Flávio PonzoniHAL is a multi-disciplinary open access archive for the deposit and dissemination of sci-entific research documents, whether they are pub-lished or not.
