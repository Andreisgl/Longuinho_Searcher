The aim of this study was to determine how individual differences in cynical hostility and defensiveness interacted with situational demands to affect cardiovascular responses in a natural setting. Defensiveness was found to interact significantly with cynical hostility in predicting subjects &apos; heart rate responses in different work contexts. Specifically, in a hospital setting involving interpersonal conflict, subjects who were high in both defensiveness and hostility showed heart rate responses approximately 10 bpm higher than subjects who were high in hostility but low in defensiveness. The same pattern of relationships was obtained for diastolic blood pressure. High and low hostile subjects were also found to differ from each other in their d...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In study 1, a preload of either 50 g of fructose or glucose was administered in solution, and food intake at a buffet lunch presented 2.25 h after preload was assessed. Significant differences in caloric intake were observed between load conditions with the fructose group consuming fewer calories than the glucose group. Obese subjects demonstrated significantly greater insulin responses to the preload compared with lean subjects, and insulin levels of obese subjects at 15, 30, and 45 mm after preload were found to correlate significantly with amount consumed. Incorporation of fructose or glucose into a mixed meal format in study 2 revealed no differences in subsequent caloric intake as a function of either type of preload or percent overweight. Differing insulin levels are discussed as a possible mechanism for differential food...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This article presents converging findings from human behavioral research, brain imaging, and basic neuroscience on smoking as self-medication for attentional and emotional dysfunctions. Nicotine and other tobacco constituents have significant effects on neural circuitry underlying the regulation of attention and affect. Age, sex, early environment, and exposure to other drugs have been identified as important factors that moderate both the effects of nicotine on brain circuitry and behavior and the risk for smoking initiation. Findings also suggest that the effects of smoking differ depending on whether smoking is used to regulate attention or affect. Individual differences in the reinforcement processes underlying tobacco use have implications for the development of tailored smoking cessation programs and prevention strategies that include early treatment of attentional and emotional dysfunctions.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
