They are also related to the “image of Elohim." The sefirotic elaboration of the “image of Elohim” by the Sefer Yetzirah and the relevant Zoharic passages that lead one toward grasping the meaning of the Yetziratic expression "ten sefirot bĕlî mah" is important for two crucial reasons. First, the ten-sefirotic array representing the “forces” or “gods” that presumably constitute Elohim, when combined with the import of the ubiquitous “wells” (discussed in the WHERE[OBJECT] section), will necessarily lead us to the seven chakras within the human body. The latter are, I will argue, unmistakably implicated in the Pentateuchal text, while the ten sefirot are both a numerical and conceptual later elaboration of the chakra-based framework. Second, the Zohar’s enabling the determination of the meaning of the “mah”—albeit requiring some serious kabbalistic juggling on the part of the investigator (see "Excursus: Deconstructing Bĕlî Mah" section in Chapter 9) is critical for establishing one of the very few genuine Hebraic “words of power.” The Pentateuchal text knows next to nothing about the sefirot, and it certainly strenuously rejects a dualistic division of reality. It does have, of course, the two celebrated trees—the Tree of Life and the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. The question of the WHAT[OBJECT] will thus be provisionally (in Chapter 9) decided as being related to the following emerging notion: THE BODY AS A TREE OF LIFE. The human being is endowed with seven spiritual-somatic potencies (the seven “chakras,” as discussed in detail later), and these, for the Homo erectus who eventually becomes Homo sapiens and finally Homo sapiens sapiens, do line up vertically (thus resembling a tree).See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersKABBALAH -JEWISH MYSTICISM IN A NUTSHELLLeo M AbramiKabbalah is the name given to the Jewish Mystical Tradition. It comprises the esoteric teachings which were received (kabbalah means that which was received in Hebrew) and then passed on from one generation to the next. The term ‘esoteric’ means that these teachings are understood only by the few who have been adequately initiated. It constitutes a path to spirituality emancipated from some of the norms of established religion.Download Free PDFView PDFKupdf.net experiences of the left hand pathmehmet yenenDownload Free PDFView PDFThe Inner Ascent2018 • John NoyceThroughout history and in many cultures, humans have looked to the Divine. Just as the Pharoahs of ancient Egypt visualised themselves ascending the steps of the pyramids, so later civilisations imagined the use of stairways, ladders, gates, rooms and other representations of an ascent to the Divine. This book examines these ascents in the ancient world, in the Jewish, Christian and Islamic traditions, in Renaissance and early modern Europe, and in the yogic traditions of India. The book contains many illustrations from manuscripts and books.Download Free PDFView PDFFAQs apropos of A. S.
