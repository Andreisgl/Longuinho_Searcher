The assessment of the impact of climate change on the river flow regime has been carried out using 32 indicators of hydrologic alteration (IHA) and analysis of flow duration curves (FDCs). A well-calibrated hydrological model (Soil and Water Assessment Tool, SWAT) has been used to simulate near future (NF 2020–2050) and far future (FF 2070–2100) period flows using climate data obtained from four General Circulation Models (GCMs) for two representative concentration pathways (RCPs) scenarios. The projected relative change (%) analysis of IHAs reveals that for the Godavari River basin (GRB), several IHAs showed increasing relative change in their median values higher than the threshold value of ± 30%, indicating significant alteration. The overall flow regime alteration for the GRB has been projected to be of highly altered category for future periods and emission scenarios. The FDC analysis for GRB reveal that the overall water yield is likely to increase for both future periods and emission scenarios, indicating the need for a relook into the future water management perspective in terms of water storage capacity, large area inundation, agricultural water management, cropping intensity, and aquatic ecosystem management. Therefore, the present study results would provide a valuable tool for decision-makers for strategy formulation in the GRB. The methodology adopted in the present study could be utilized for the hydrologic alteration assessment under climate change in the major river basins of India and elsewhere.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Results: Based on the phase solubility graph, a 1:1 ratio was selected for complex formation by Kc value which decided a quite stable form of a complex. The characterization of all three types of inclusion complex was performed by DSC and SEM. It proved that different moiety of the complex was formed, but all are quite stable with negligible interaction. The kneading method as the best inclusion complex at ratio 1:1 was selected after evaluating by performing per...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The serious faces of the education institutions come only from the high standards of the research and percolation of the same to the community who are the party of interest i.e. teachers, students, recruiters, society in general and other utility terminals. A traditional way of discussion in the classroom with theoretical models and without cases of the real situations requires more time for tuning the managerial aspirants with the industrial dynamic equations. We study few successful models of education on different philosophies to train students for employment to global market, to domestic market, and to the market that is new to the economic developments. We also propose a model of business education that trains the mediocre minds to be the entrepreneurs and leaders of tomorrow.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Previously, Petri Nets formalization were used to model and tackle cyberattacks but due to advancement in technology and Internet, cybercriminals are using various machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) approaches to commence cyberattacks. As DL approaches were used in processing of image and recognition of speech, cybersecurity experts were busy using DL techniques to tackle those cyberattacks. This survey report focuses on DL methods put forward recently for cybersecurity. First, some basic need of cybersecurity including issues is described. Then favored models and algorithms of DL are explained. Subsequently, frameworks of DL required in the area of cybersecurity applications are proposed. Afterward, work on cybersecurity based on DL is discussed which include detection of malwares, intrusions, phishing, spam, and Web site defacement. Finally, improvement of various cybersecurity applications is suggested as discussed in the future research scopes followed by some concluding remarks.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The findings showed that 40% papers were published in special issues and the highest number (27%) of articles was published during 2008-2011. Like regular issues, Indian authors also published the highest number of articles in special issues. Also, authors affiliated to different institutions of Delhi contributed the most number of articles like regular issues. Among the institutions, CSIR-NISTADS followed by DRDO-DESIDOC topped the list of prolific institutions unlike the regular issues, where DRDO-DESIDOC topped the list. Like number of papers in regular issues, B.M. Gupta had the highest number of papers to his credit in special issues. However, the highest value of citation per paper (CPP) was for B.S. Kademani (BARC) who was not listed among the highly cited authors in regular issues. The value of CPP for papers published in special and regular issues was almost equal.

Previously, applications were often made through assembly language programming or for a specific kernel. Compiler technology and its influence on hardware performance were isolated from the architecture and its performance. However, now the compiler significantly affects the performance of a computer. Hence, understanding compiler technology is critical to the design and efficient implementation of an instruction set. Although the compilers are designed as per the language to be executed upon, their efficient functioning very much depends on the hardware used. A perfect balance between compilers and computer architectures, which varies according to the code to be executed, is the key to fruitful designing of highly efficient and effective computer systems. It is very imperative to study the relations of computer architecture...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
