Focusing on the cultural, legal, and scientific controversy over Kennewick Man, the ancient human remains discovered in Washington state in 1996, the article explores the narrative politics of American national belonging. Through a popular historical novel on Kennewick Man's life, the article further theorizes nostalgia as a narrative tool in imagining the evolutionary origins of the nation. The article argues that nostalgia produces a temporal dynamic that bridges the gap between national history and global prehistory, and that this dynamic is reinforced through cultural ideas of genetic knowledge. At the same time, prehistoric nostalgia renders problematic ideas of ethnic difference largely invisible.Save to LibraryDownloadby Venla Oikkonen•  44  American History, Cultural Studies, American Studies, Indigenous StudiesWhen one phenotype is not enough: divergent evolutionary trajectories govern venom variation in a widespread rattlesnake speciesUnderstanding the origin and maintenance of phenotypic variation, particularly across a continuous spatial distribution, represents a key challenge in evolutionary biology.

For this, animal venoms represent ideal study systems: they are complex, variable, yet easily quantifiable molecular phenotypes with a clear function. Rattlesnakes display tremendous variation in their venom composition, mostly through strongly dichotomous venom strategies, which may even coexist within a single species. Here, through dense, widespread population-level sampling of the Mojave rattlesnake, Crotalus scutulatus, we show that genomic structural variation at multiple loci underlies extreme  geographical variation in venom composition, which is maintained despite extensive gene flow. Unexpectedly, neither diet composition nor neutral population structure explain venom variation. Instead, venom divergence is strongly correlated with environmental conditions. Individual toxin genes correlate with distinct environmental factors, suggesting that different selective pressures can act on individual loci independently of their co-expression patterns or genomic proximity. Our results challenge common assumptions about diet composition as the key selective driver of snake venom evolution and emphasize how the interplay between genomic architecture and local scale spatial heterogeneity in selective pressures may facilitate the retention of adaptive functional polymorphisms across a continuous space.Save to LibraryDownloadby Juan Calvete and +3Michael CardwellDominic LannuttiWolfgang Wüster•  12  Evolutionary Biology, Genetics, Genomics, TranscriptomicsTabula rasa or refugia?

We summarise recent studies of mitochondrial DNA and lactase persistence allele -13915*G in order to reconstruct the population histories of modern Arabs. These data, in turn, enable us to assess different scenarios for the peopling of the Pen- insula over the course of the Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene. The evidence sup- ports the posited existence of Arabian refugia, although it is inconclusive which (e.g. Persian Gulf basin, Yemeni highlands and/or Red Sea basin) was/were responsible for housing ancestral populations during the Last Glacial Maximum. Synthesising genetic and archaeological data sets, we conclude that a substantial portion of the present South Arabian gene pool derives from a deeply rooted population that underwent sig- nificant internal growth within Arabia some 12,000 years ago. At the same time, we interpret the disappearance of Nejd Leptolithic archaeological sites in southern Arabia around 8000 years ago to represent the termination of a significant component of the Pleistocene gene pool.Save to LibraryDownloadby Jeff Rose•  14  Genetics, Population Genetics, Neolithic Archaeology, ArchaeogeneticsCounting the Founders: The Matrilineal Genetic Ancestry of the Jewish DiasporaSave to LibraryDownloadby David Gurwitz•  21  Engineering, Genetics, Physics, ChemistryTwo newly identified genetic determinants of pigmentation in EuropeansSave to LibraryDownloadby Snæbjörn Pálsson•  16  Genetics, Pigmentation, Population Genetics, IcelandЭтногенез пуштунов (афганцев) с точки зрения популяционной генетикиRussian Journal of Genetic Genealogy.

Therefore, biological material derived from dogs may constitute evidence in forensic caseworks and it may be necessary or helpful to obtain genetic profiles that would aid individual identification. Currently, the assessment of the genetic diversity of breeds, population structure, inbreeding, and the development of methodologies for population assignment are important areas of research in dogs and related species such as the grey wolf. Therefore, canine short tandem repeat (STR)-based genotyping is used by a significant number of population geneticists; however, for reasons we present here, it is utilized by a relatively small number of forensic practitioners. An extensive bibliographic search revealed a highly fragmented canine genotyping community working under less than well defined standards. In this work, we discuss the present developments and limitations of STR-based canine genotyping. Furthermore, we recommend that a collaborative strategy for the implementation of standardization and harmonization is crucial to the development of forensic canine genotyping.Save to LibraryDownloadby Barbara van Asch•  6  Population Genetics, Microsatellites, Microsatellite Markers, GenotypingMolecular tools and analytical approaches for the characterization of farm animal genetic diversityGenetic studies of livestock populations focus on questions of domestication, within- and among-breed diversity, breed history and adaptive variation.

In this review, we describe the use of different molecular markers and methods for data analysis used to address these questions. There is a clear trend towards the use of single nucleotide polymorphisms and whole-genome sequence information, the application of Bayesian or Approximate Bayesian analysis and the use of adaptive next to neutral diversity to support decisions on conservation.Save to LibraryDownloadby Hans Lenstra•  14  Genetics, Zoology, Genomics, Population GeneticsHistorical stocking data and 19th century DNA reveal human-induced changes to native diversity and distribution of cutthroat troutSave to LibraryDownloadby Kyle Keepers•  12  Phylogeography, Population Genetics, Molecular Ecology, Biological SciencesIncreasing the reference populations for the 55 AISNP panel: the need and benefitsAncestry inference for an individual can only be as good as the reference populations with allele frequency data on the SNPs being used.

If the most relevant ancestral population(s) does not have data available for the SNPs studied, then analyses based on DNA evidence may indicate a quite distantly related population, albeit one among the more closely related of the existing reference populations. We have added reference population allele frequencies for 14 additional population samples (with &gt;1100 individuals studied) to the 125 population samples previously published for the Kidd Lab 55 AISNP panel. Allele frequencies are now publicly available for all 55 SNPs in ALFRED and FROG-kb for a total of 139 population samples. This Kidd Lab panel of 55 ancestry informative SNPs has been incorporated in commercial kits by both ThermoFisher Scientific and Illumina for massively parallel sequencing. Researchers employing those kits will find the enhanced set of reference populations useful.Save to LibraryDownloadby Sibte Hadi•  7  Population Genetics, Humans, Ethnic Groups, Legal MedicineGenetic Variability and Population Structure of Polish Konik Horse Maternal Lines Based on Microsatellite MarkersThe aim of the conservation programme is to maintain the population size of endangered livestock breeds of less economic importance at a level that ensures the survival of the breed, the preservation of genetic diversity, and the... moreThe aim of the conservation programme is to maintain the population size of endangered livestock breeds of less economic importance at a level that ensures the survival of the breed, the preservation of genetic diversity, and the preservation of as many pedigree lines as possible. The Polish Konik, a native Polish primitive-type horse breed and is one of the breeds included in such a programme in Poland. Presently, there are only 16 (of the 35 maternal lines known in 1962), some of which are endangered. We examined the genetic variability and structure of the Polish Konik maternal lines (176 individuals) on the basis of the pedigree data and 17 microsatellite markers (STRs) from parentage testing. The overall mean number of alleles was 7.647 (±0.411), the effective number of alleles was 3.935 (±0.271), the mean number of alleles for which the frequency was equal to or lower than 5% was 4.471 (±0.286), and the mean information index was 1.506 (±0.087). The structure of the population and admixture patterns were calculated with the Structure and Structure Harvester software. The structural analysis indicated three likely genetic clusters; as the most optimal K value was estimated as 3, with ∆K of 15.4188. The F-statistics results indicated a low level of inbreeding (average inbreeding coefficient FIT was 0.0188, coefficient of differentiation FST was 0.0304, and mean inbreeding index value FIS was −0.0119). Variability monitoring should be carried out in order to avoid inbreeding depression, while breeding strategies should be designed to prevent the decrease of genetic variability in the Polish horse breed and to sustain the active female lines.Save to LibraryDownloadby Agnieszka Bieniek and +1Adrianna D.

Any information that might help to elucidate their ecology is essential. We explored the population and genetic structures of Anisakis spp. nematodes isolated from four toothed whale species – bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus), striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba), Risso’s dolphins (Grampus griseus) and Cuvier’s beaked whales (Ziphius cavirostris) – stranded along the eastern Adriatic Sea coast (1990–2012) to reveal more information on host ecological patterns. Lower parasite prevalence was observed in resident dolphin species compared with occasionally occurring species, as well as in young compared with adult dolphins, indicating different feeding habits related to age. No unequivocal relationship between the biological traits of a host (age, body length, body mass and blubber depth) and Anisakis population parameters was observed. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a new geographical record of Anisakis simplex sensu stricto (1.96%) and Anisakis physeteris (1.31%) in the Adriatic Sea in addition to resident Anisakis pegreffii (96.73%). In an assessment of the Adriatic Sea and oceans worldwide, the genetic structure of Anisakis revealed that A. pegreffii populations do not differ among various final host species but do differ with respect to geographical location in contrast to previously accepted Anisakis panmixia.Save to LibraryDownloadby Kristina  Gucek•  6  Population Genetics, Adriatic Sea, Anisakis, Host Parasite InteractionUpdated Brazilian STR allele frequency data using over 100,000 individuals: An analysis of CSF1PO, D3S1358, D5S818, D7S820, D8S1179, D13S317, D16S539, D18S51, D21S11, FGA, Penta D, Penta E, TH01, TPOX and vWA lociSave to LibraryDownloadby Amanda Castro•  13  Genetics, Forensic Science, Population Genetics, BrazilMolecular characterization of oilseed rape accessions collected from multi continents for exploitation of potential heterotic group through SSR markersSave to LibraryDownloadby Muhammad Younas•  16  Population Genetics, Principal Component Analysis, Biology, AgricultureLost In Transition-The Island of Susak (1951-2001)Save to LibraryDownloadby Lajos Szirovicza•  13  Social Change, Anthropology, Population Genetics, Quality of lifeInferring Population Genetic Structure in Widely and Continuously Distributed Carnivores: The Stone Marten (Martes foina) as a Case StudyThe stone marten is a widely distributed mustelid in the Palaearctic region that exhibits variable habitat preferences in different parts of its range.

The species is a Holocene immigrant from southwest Asia which, according to fossil remains, followed the expansion of the Neolithic farming cultures into Europe and possibly colonized the Iberian Peninsula during the Early Neolithic (ca. 7,000 years BP). However, the population genetic structure and historical biogeography of this generalist carnivore remains essentially unknown. In this study we have combined mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequencing (621 bp) and microsatellite genotyping (23 polymorphic markers) to infer the population genetic structure of the stone marten within the Iberian Peninsula. The mtDNA data revealed low haplotype and nucleotide diversities and a lack of phylogeographic structure, most likely due to a recent colonization of the Iberian Peninsula by a few mtDNA lineages during the Early Neolithic.

No information is available regarding the genetic structure of mahogany in South America, yet the region harbours most of the unlogged populations of this prized hardwood. Here we report on the genetic diversity within and the differentiation among seven natural populations separated by up to 2100 km along the southern arc of the Brazilian Amazon basin. We analysed the variation at eight microsatellite loci for 194 adult individuals. All loci were highly variable, with the number of alleles per locus ranging from 13 to 27 (mean = 18.4). High levels of genetic diversity were found for all populations at the eight loci (mean HE = 0.781, range 0.754–0.812). We found moderate but statistically significant genetic differentiation among populations considering both estimators of FST and RST, θ = 0.097 and ρ = 0.147, respectively. Estimates of θ and ρ were significantly greater than zero for all pairwise population comparisons. Pairwise ρ-values were positively and significantly correlated with geographical distance under the isolation-by-distance model. Furthermore, four of the populations exhibited a significant inbreeding coefficient. The finding of local differentiation among Amazonian mahogany populations underscores the need for in situ conservation of multiple populations of S. macrophylla across its distribution in the Brazilian Amazon. In addition, the occurrence of microgeographical genetic differentiation at a local scale indicates the importance of maintaining populations in their diverse habitats, especially in areas with mosaics of topography and soil.Save to LibraryDownloadby Rogério Gribel•  22  Geography, Forestry, Conservation Genetics, Population GeneticsPopulation Genetics Study of Isoniazid Resistance Mutations and Evolution of Multidrug-Resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosisSave to LibraryDownloadby Fernando Chaves•  20  Microbiology, Population Genetics, Medical Microbiology, Tuberculosis and Infectious DiseaseGenetic differentiation, hybridization and adaptive divergence in two subspecies of the acorn barnacle Tetraclita japonica in the northwestern PacificSave to LibraryDownloadby Ka Ma•  14  Population Genetics, Principal Component Analysis, Japan, Molecular EcologyGenetic Divergence in the cacophony IVS6 Intron Among Five BrazilianPopulations of Lutzomyia longipalpisGenes involved in the reproductive isolation are particularly useful as molecular markers in speciation studies.

Lutzomyia longipalpis (Diptera: Psychodidae: Phlebotominae), a putative species complex, is a vector of visceral leishmaniasis in Latin America. We isolated from this species a fragment homologous to cacophony, a Drosophila gene that encodes features of the lovesong, an acoustic signal that is important in the sexual isolation of closely related species and known to vary considerably among L. longipalpis putative siblings species. Using an intron of the sandfly cacophony as a marker, we analyzed the molecular variation and sequence divergence among five populations of L. longipalpis from Brazil, three allopatric (Jacobina, Lapinha and Natal) and two putative sympatric sibling species from the locality of Sobral. A high level of polymorphism was found and analysis of the data indicates that very little gene flow is occurring among the populations of Jacobina, Lapinha, and Natal. A high level of differentiation was also observed between the two putative sympatric species of Sobral, one of which seems to be the same sibling species found in Natal, while the other is somewhat more related to Jacobina and Lapinha. However, the amount of estimated gene flow among the Sobral siblings is about seven times higher than the previously estimated for period, another lovesong gene, perhaps indicating that introgression might be affecting cacophony more than period. The results suggest that L. longipalpis is not a single species in Brazil, but it is yet not clear whether the different populations studied deserve species status rather than representing an incipient speciation process.Save to LibraryDownloadby Solange Oliveira•  27  Evolutionary Biology, Genetics, Geography, PolymorphismEvolutionary Approaches to Solve an Integrated Lot Scheduling Problem in the Soft Drink IndustrySave to LibraryDownloadby Claudio Toledo•  12  Population Genetics, Genetic Algorithms, Scheduling, Hybrid Intelligent SystemsGenetic structure and phylogeography of a European flagship species, the white-tailed sea eagle Haliaeetus albicillaSave to LibraryDownloadby Frank Hailer•  22  Genetics, Geography, Polymorphism, Population GeneticsSpatial Subdivision and Genetic Diversity in Populations on the East and West Coasts of Australia: The Multi-Faceted Case of Nautilus pompilius (Mollusca, Cephalopoda)Save to LibraryDownloadby Gabriel Vianna and +1Stephen  Newman•  12  Population Genetics, Stratification, Genetic Diversity, Genetic StructureTackling the population genetics of clonal and partially clonal organismsSave to LibraryDownloadby Francois Balloux•  3  Population Genetics, Biological Sciences, Environmental SciencesAllele frequencies of the new European Standard Set (ESS) loci in the Italian populationSave to LibraryDownloadby Elena Pilli and +1Alessandro Bosetti•  15  Population Genetics, Capillary electrophoresis, Italy, Biological SciencesThe origin of the major cystic fibrosis mutation (ΔF508) in European populationsSave to LibraryDownloadby Jaume Bertranpetit•  11  Population Genetics, Cystic Fibrosis, Biological Sciences, HumansMangroves of the United Arab Emirates: ecotypic diversity in cuticular waxes at the bioclimatic extremeSave to LibraryDownloadby Richard DODD•  13  Genetics, Population Genetics, Plant Biology, Aquatic botanyDetSel 1.0: A Computer Program to Detect Markers Responding to SelectionSave to LibraryDownloadby Pierre Boursot•  7  Genetics, Population Genetics, Population genetics (Biology), HeredityAnálisis Genéticos en La Raza Poni Vasco-Pottoka.

Microsatellite genotypes were derived, and allelic and genotypic frequencies, heterozygosities and gene diversity were estimated. A total of 131 alleles were distinguished by the 21 microsatellite markers used. All the microsatellites were highly polymorphic, with mean (±s.e.) allelic number of 6.24 ±1.7, ranging 4–10 per locus. The observed heterozygosity in the population ranged between 0.261 and 0.809, with mean (±s.e.) of 0.574 ±0.131, indicating considerable genetic variation in this population. Genetic bottleneck hypotheses were also explored.

Here we assess the genome ancestry of the Azorean population through analysis of six Alu polymorphic sites (TPA-25, ACE, APO, B65, PV92, and D1) in 65 Azoreans and 30 Portuguese unrelated blood donors and compare data for the Y-chromosome and mtDNA. Allele frequencies were calculated by direct counting. Statistical analysis was performed using Arlequin 2.0. Nei's genetic distance was calculated with DISPAN software, and trees were constructed by neighbor joining (NJ) using PHYLIP 3.63. The results show that all Alu insertions were polymorphic. APO is the closest to fixation. The less frequent insertions are PV92 and D1 in the Azores and Portugal, respectively. ACE and TPA-25 show the highest values of heterozygosity in both populations. Allele frequencies are very similar to those obtained in European populations. These results are validated by the Y-chromosome and mtDNA data, where the majority of the maternal and paternal lineages are European. Overall, these data are reflected in the phylogenetic tree, in which the Azoreans and the Portuguese branch with Catalans, Andalusians, Moroccans, and Algerians. We conclude that the population of the Azores shows no significant genetic differences from that of mainland Portugal and that it is an outbred population. Moreover, the data validate the use of Alu insertion polymorphisms to assess the origin and history of human populations. Am. J. Hum.

We assayed variation at nuclear microsatellite markers among peripheral vs. continuous populations of the temperate South American species Austrocedrus chilensis, to investigate the role of historical vs. demographical forces in shaping population genetic structure. This species occurs in continuous populations in the west and central distribution range, but becomes highly fragmented at the eastern limit, which comprised ice-free areas during Quaternary glaciations and has extreme climatic conditions at present times. Bayesian analysis methods identified two contrasting patterns of genetic structure; (I) populations from humid, mesic and peri-glacial regions formed a single deme with relatively low genetic differentiation and high admixture levels whereas (II) a highly heterogeneous genetic structure with low level of admixture was found in the steppe, towards the east and northeast limit of the distribution range. In the steppe, population fragmentation, restricted gene flow and isolation-by-distance were also inferred. In addition, several small steppe populations showed high genetic diversity and divergent gene pools, suggesting that they constitute ancient refuges from pre-Holocene glaciations with just a subgroup of them contributing significantly to post-glacial spread. These results are discussed in relation to patterns of genetic variation found for other temperate species and the contribution of the particular southern Andes topography and climate to post-glacial spread.Save to LibraryDownloadby Maria Arana•  26  Evolutionary Biology, Genetics, Zoology, GeographyComparative molecular phylogeography of two Xenopus species, X. gilli and X. laevis, in the south-western Cape Province, South AfricaSave to LibraryDownloadby Juan Morales•  20  Conservation Genetics, Population Genetics, Molecular Evolution, Endangered SpeciesNextLast »Related TopicsGeneticsFollowFollowingEvolutionary geneticsFollowFollowingGenomicsFollowFollowingEvolutionary BiologyFollowFollowingPhylogeneticsFollowFollowingMolecular GeneticsFollowFollowingConservation GeneticsFollowFollowingPhylogeographyFollowFollowingMolecular EvolutionFollowFollowingBioinformaticsFollowFollowing 71.6 million researchers use this site every month.
