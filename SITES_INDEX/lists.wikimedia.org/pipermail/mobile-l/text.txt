[WikimediaMobile] Wikivoyage: Need for a 100% offline app

Hello all,
I am Nicolas Raoul, 10 years of wikipedia editing.
I just released this non-official Android app for Wikivoyage offline:
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.github.OxygenGuide
Free, open source, of course.
It serves a different purpose than the existing official Wikivoyage app.
It lets people read Wikivoyage even when offline.
Like a paper guidebook, but stored in your phone.
At first run, it downloads OxygenGuide (a ZIP of all Wikivoyage text, 80MB).
Then you can enjoy the articles offline.
Bonus: Offline is much faster, because data is loaded from the SD card, not
from the Internet.
Offline is vital for travellers, because roaming is expensive.
Wikimedia's official app is great, but not offline, making it no-go for
most travellers... there is a "Save page" feature, but it is difficult to
know in advance every place and topic a travel you lead you to. Imagine
selecting and cutting pages from a paper guidebook one-by-one... rather
take the whole book if it is not heavy, right?
Special:Book generates monolithic A4-sized EPUB files with images, too
heavy for a phone if you select more than a few articles.
The app is functional, but ugly and many features could be added.
If anyone is interested, you're very welcome to join the team :-)
If Wikimedia wants to overtake the app, I would be flattered! If not, I
just continue as non-official, no worry.
If I violate any trademark or license, please let me know.
Also, any feedback is very welcome!
By the way, non-Android users can also copy the HTML articles manually to
their phone/reader/laptop: https://code.google.com/p/oxygenguide
Cheers!
Nicolas Raoul

yet when he posted. And sorry for kind of cross-posting with wikivoyage-l.
