In this work, we evaluated whether there is physiological plasticity in the thermal performance curve (TPC) of maximum jumping speed in individuals acclimated to current and projected temperatures and whether there is an opportunity for behavioral thermoregulation in the desert landscape where inhabits the northernmost population of the endemic frog Pleurodema thaul. Our results indicate that individuals acclimated to 20°C and 25°C increased the breath of their TPCs by shifting their upper limits with respect to when they were acclimated at 10°C. In addition, even when dispersal is not possible for this population, the landscape is heterogeneous enough to offer opportunities for behavioral thermoregulation. In particular, under current climatic conditions , behavioral thermoregulation is not compulsory as available operative temperatures are encompassed within the population TPC limits. However, for severe projected temperatures under climate change, behavioral thermoregula-tion will be required in the sunny patches. In overall, our results suggest that this population of Pleurodema thaul will be able to endure the worst projected scenario of climate warming as it has not only the physiological capacities but also the environmental opportunities to regulate its body temperature behaviorally.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersThermal physiology of Amazonian lizards (Reptilia: SquamataLuisa M Diele-Viegas, Carla M . Sette, Teresa Ávila-PiresWe summarize thermal-biology data of 69 species of Amazonian lizards, including mode of thermoregulation and field-active body temperatures (T b). We also provide new data on preferred temperatures (T pref), voluntary and thermal-tolerance ranges, and thermal-performance curves (TPC's) for 27 species from nine sites in the Brazilian Amazonia. We tested for phylogenetic signal and pairwise correlations among thermal traits. We found that species generally categorized as thermoregulators have the highest mean values for all thermal traits, and broader ranges for T b , critical thermal maximum (CT max) and optimal (T opt) temperatures. Species generally categorized as thermoconformers have large ranges for T pref , critical thermal minimum (CT min), and minimum voluntary (VT min) temperatures for performance. Despite these differences, our results show that all thermal characteristics overlap between both groups and suggest that Amazonian lizards do not fit into discrete thermoreg-ulatory categories. The traits are all correlated, with the exceptions of (1) T opt , which does not correlate with CT max , and (2) CT min , and correlates only with T opt. Weak phylogenetic signals for T b , T pref and VT min indicate that these characters may be shaped by local environmental conditions and influenced by phylogeny. We found that open-habitat species perform well under present environmental conditions, without experiencing detectable thermal stress from high environmental temperatures induced in lab experiments. For forest-dwelling lizards, we expect warming trends in Amazonia to induce thermal stress, as temperatures surpass the thermal tolerances for these species.Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of Thermal BiologyInteractions between thermoregulatory behavior and physiological acclimatization in a wild lizard population2018 • Norma L .

Thus, we know comparatively little about how they interact to shape physiological variation in natural populations. Here, we test the hypothesis that behavioral thermoregulation and thermal acclimatization interact to shape physiological phenotypes in a natural population of the diurnal lizard, Sceloporus torquatus. Every month for one year we examined thermoregulatory effectiveness and changes in the population mean in three physiological parameters: cold tolerance (Ct min), heat tolerance (Ct max), and the preferred body temperature (T pref), to indirectly assess thermal acclimatization in population means. We discovered that S. torquatus is an active thermoregulator throughout the year, with body temperature varying little despite strong seasonal temperature shifts. Although we did not observe a strong signal of acclimatization in Ct max , we did find that Ct min shifts in parallel with nighttime temperatures throughout the year. This likely occurs, at least in part, because thermoregulation is substantially less effective at buffering organisms from selection on lower physiological limits than upper physiological limits. Active thermoregulation is effective at limiting exposure to extreme temperatures during the day, but is less effective at night, potentially contributing to greater plasticity in Ct min than Ct max. Importantly, however, T pref tracked seasonal changes in temperature, which is one the factors contributing to highly effective thermoregulation throughout the year. Thus, behavior and physiological plasticity do not always operate independently, which could impact how organisms can respond to rising temperatures.Download Free PDFView PDFComparative thermal ecophysiology in Pristidactylus scapulatus populations from the Puna region of Argentinajuan carlos acostaReptiles are important models for understanding fundamental aspects of physiological ecology and for assessing how environmental change can impact biodiversity. Abiotic factors (micro-environmental temperatures, operative temperatures, thermal quality) may vary geographically along an altitudinal and latitudinal gradient, and therefore the different thermal resources available for thermoregulation also vary. Comparative analyses among populations provide an opportunity to understand how variation in abiotic factors can affect different ecophysiological traits of a species at different geographical points. Our objective was to carry out a comparative study between two populations of Pristidactylus scapulatus in the Puna region of Argentina, providing the first data available on thermal ecophysiology, thermoregulatory efficiency and locomotor performance of the species. We determined field body temperature, micro-environmental temperatures and operative temperatures. In the laboratory, we measured preferred temperatures and calculated the index of thermoregulatory efficiency. In addition, we recorded critical temperature (minimum and maximum) and we estimated the thermal sensitivity of locomotion by measuring sprint speed at different body temperatures; based on these data we calculated the optimal temperature for performance, the optimal performance breadth and thermal safety margin. Air temperatures and operative temperatures were different between sites. However, we only found differences between populations in the minimum critical temperatures, with these being lower at higher latitude. We note that P. scapulatus populations adjust optimal temperatures of performance to field body temperatures and preferred temperatures, which could reduce the costs of thermoregulation in lizards with limited daily activity and who inhabit sites with variable and unpredictable environment temperatures. We conclude that Pristidactylus scapulatus has thermal sensitivity in locomotor performance, is a moderate thermoregulator with respect to the environment and is a eurithermic lizard, which has thermal flexibility in the cold.Download Free PDFView PDFThermal adaptation of amphibians in tropical mountains: consequences of global warming = Adaptaciones térmicas de anfibios en montañas tropicales: consecuencias del calentamiento global = Adaptacions tèrmiques d’amfibis en muntanyes tropicals: conseqüències de l’escalfament global2018 • Pol Pintanel CostaTemperature is likely to be one of the most important abiotic factors given how it affects the physiology of the whole organism and as a consequence, it has an essential role in ecology and evolution. However, how the geographical (and temporal) variation of temperature is related to physiology still raises many questions. Several macrophysiological hypotheses have been proposed to explain the variation patterns of thermal physiological parameters across ecological gradients. Among them, Janzen’s (1967) &#39;seasonality’ hypothesis is probably one of the most relevant as it has awakened a great interest in other areas besides physiology itself, such as biogeography, ecology, evolution and conservation biology. Janzen proposed that tropical species are specialists to thermally stable environments and therefore would be more limited to dispersing altitudinally (up or down mountain) than temperate species because of evolved physiological barriers.

Lagos, Juan Diego Gaitán-Espitia, M A LardiesEnvironmental temperature has profound effects on the biological performance and biogeographical distribution of ectothermic species. Variation of this abiotic factor across geographic gradients is expected to produce physiological differentiation and local adaptation of natural populations depending on their thermal tolerances and physiological sensitivities. Here, we studied geographic variation in whole-organism thermal physiology of seven populations of the porcelain crab Petrolisthes violaceus across a latitudinal gradient of 3000 km, characterized by a cline of thermal conditions. Our study found that populations of P. violaceus show no differences in the limits of their thermal performance curves and demonstrate a negative correlation of their optimal temperatures with latitude. Additionally, our findings show that high-latitude populations of P. violaceus exhibit broader thermal tolerances, which is consistent with the climatic variability hypothesis. Interestingly, under a future scenario of warming oceans, the thermal safety margins of P. violaceus indicate that lower latitude populations can physiologically tolerate the ocean-warming scenarios projected by the IPCC for the end of the twenty-first century.Download Free PDFView PDFHabitat management alters thermal opportunitylance mcbrayer1. Ectotherms engage in behavioral thermoregulation to optimize body temperatures , however, thermoregulatory effort varies across species, over time, and among habitats. Classic cost-benefit models of ectothermic thermoregulation postulate that ectotherms should increase thermoregulatory effort when the benefits of thermoregulatory behavior outweigh the costs (Huey and Slatkin, 1976). However, alteration of habitat via land management may lead to unforeseen shifts in microclimate that change associated costs and benefits. In light of anthropogenic impacts on natural habitats, thermoregulatory effort should be examined in cases where land management results in environmental temperatures that deviate from the preferred temperature range of a given species. 2. We examined how habitat management alters microclimates and influences activity time, thermoregulatory behavior, and thermal physiology in a lizard (Sceloporus woodi) whose range has been significantly reduced due to habitat loss. We compared populations from two ecologically distinct habitats: longleaf pine and sand pine scrub, which have very different management histories. Daily surveys were conducted in each habitat type while environmental temperatures were recorded simultaneously with biophysical models. 3. Thermal performance curves differed between populations such that physiological performance was optimized in each environment. Longleaf pine habitat had greater thermal opportunity because cooler microclimates were available on arboreal perches. In longleaf pine habitat, lizards were able to stay active longer and thermoregulate more effectively. Regardless of habitat, thermoregulatory effort of S. woodi increased when thermal quality of habitat was low. However, when unfavorably high temperatures were experienced, the thermoregulatory effort increased significantly. 4. Our results demonstrate that ectotherms can afford to imprecisely thermoregu-late when habitat thermal quality is poor due to cooler environmental temperatures. However under unfavorably hot environmental temperatures, lizards must precisely regulate body temperature in spite of any costs. These results further demonstrate that habitat management has major implications on species-specific thermal opportunity, thermoregulatory behavior, and thermal physiology, such that shifts in thermoregulatory behavior may lead to higher energetic costs, enhanced predation risk, and constrained activity times.Download Free PDFView PDFExtinction risks forced by climatic change and intraspecific variation in the thermal physiology of a tropical lizardLuisa M Diele-ViegasA B S T R A C T Temperature increases can impact biodiversity and predicting their effects is one of the main challenges facing global climate-change research. Ectotherms are sensitive to temperature change and, although predictions indicate that tropical species are highly vulnerable to global warming, they remain one of the least studied groups with respect to the extent of physiological variation and local extinction risks. We model the extinction risks for a tropical heliothermic teiid lizard (Kentropyx calcarata) integrating previously obtained information on in-traspecific phylogeographic structure, eco-physiological traits and contemporary species distributions in the Amazon rainforest and its ecotone to the Cerrado savannah. We also investigated how thermal-biology traits vary throughout the species' geographic range and the consequences of such variation for lineage vulnerability. We show substantial variation in thermal tolerance of individuals among thermally distinct sites. Thermal critical limits were highly correlated with operative environmental temperatures. Our physiological/climatic model predicted relative extinction risks for local populations within clades of K. calcarata for 2050 ranging between 26.1% and 70.8%, while for 2070, extinction risks ranged from 52.8% to 92.8%. Our results support the hypothesis that tropical-lizard taxa are at high risk of local extinction caused by increasing temperatures. However, the thermo-physiological differences found across the species' distribution suggest that local adaptation may allow persistence of this tropical ectotherm in global warming scenarios. These results will serve as basis to further research to investigate the strength of local adaptation to climate change. Persistence of Kentropyx cal-carata also depends on forest preservation, but the Amazon rainforest is currently under high deforestation rates. We argue that higher conservation priority is necessary so the Amazon rainforest can fulfill its capacity to absorb the impacts of temperature increase on tropical ectotherms during climate change.Download Free PDFView PDFThermal physiology responds to interannual temperature shifts in a montane horned lizard, Phrynosoma orbiculareDavid R . Aguillón-GutiérrezAs climate change marches on, rapidly rising temperatures shatter records every year, presenting ever-growing physiological challenges to organisms worldwide. Ectotherms rely on behavioral and physiological plasticity to contend with environmental fluctuations. Nonetheless, our understanding of thermal plasticity has been largely limited to laboratory settings. Here, we test whether aspects of thermal physiology respond to interannual shifts in thermal environment in a natural population of Phrynosoma orbiculare, a montane horned lizard, from Hidalgo, Mexico. At our field site, 2019 was markedly warmer than the year that preceded it. We detected population-level increases in three key thermal physiological traits: preferred temperature, the critical thermal minimum, and the critical thermal maximum. Thus, thermal phenotypes appear to shift in tandem in response to environmental fluctuations. A subset of individuals were resampled across years, allowing insight into plastic shifts within an organism's lifetime. We detected parallel increases in these lizards for the preferred temperature and the critical thermal minimum, but not for the critical thermal maximum. Our results support a growing body of literature indicating that preferred conditions and cold tolerance can be highly labile over the course of an organism's lifetime, whereas hardening over shorter time periods is more common for heat tolerance. Given that heat tolerance increased at the population-level, but not in resampled individuals, it is possible that rapid evolution occurred due to temperature increases. In short, physiological shifts can be observed in natural populations over relatively short timespans, and these shifts might reflect a combination of evolutionary and acclimatory responses.
