However, only 12.6% of U.S. hospitals have developed the capacity to adopt closed-loop electronic medical records (EMR). Organizational complexity may be a major factor influencing hospitals\u27 adoption of closed-loop EMR. This quantitative study explored how organizational complexity influenced hospitals\u27 adoption of closed-loop EMR. Diffusion of innovation theory was the foundation for this study. Logistic regression was used to establish possible relationships between organizational complexity and hospitals\u27 adoption of EMR for closed-loop medication therapy management. Secondary data from Health Information and Management Systems Society were examined to explore the relationship between organization complexity and hospitals\u27 adoption of EMR for closed-loop medication therapy.
