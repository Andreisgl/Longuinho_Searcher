And what interactive effects do students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, diversity and inclusion advocacy, and diverse community contexts have on one another? We draw on existing literature and quantitative data to demonstrate that SOC tend to bring strengths to global learning experiences. We share several case studies to demonstrate how those strengths may lead to specific alliances regarding justice work in host communities, complicating any conception of students as visitors unattached to local justice struggles. Throughout the article, we draw on current literature and practice to present several questions at the intersections of education abroad, diversity, equity, inclusion, community-based global learning, and critical global citizenship. Introduction In the article that follows, we upend and complicate numerous assumptions at the intersection of participant diversity, global learning goals, inclusivity and justice advocacy, and host communities. In particular we demonstrate that students of color (SOC) bring specific assets and cultural wealth to education abroad programming, and that individuals with marginalized identities frequently interact with host community justice networks in both exciting and profoundly complicated ways,See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersHartman, E. & Kiely, R.

The purpose of this inquiry was to explore the perceptions of teachers who are returned Peace Corps volunteers (RPCV) regarding what in their long-term international experience influenced them to include cultural awareness in their instruction. Bennett’s developmental model of intercultural sensitivity and Mezirow’s transformative learning theory were the conceptual frameworks. The research questions for this qualitative study asked how a long-term international volunteering experience impacts teachers’ pedagogy and what instructional practices RPCV teachers consider to be influenced by their Peace Corps experience. From 11 interviews, codes were identified and categorized into patterns and themes. There were three key findings. The first was that teachers who are RPCVs recognized their Peace Corps experience provided them with a deep cultural experience that brought about the realization of their own culture. The second was their recognition of their ability to adapt to cultural differences more easily than before they had their Peace Corps experience. The final finding was that RPCV teachers choose to use deep and engaging teaching practices with varied approaches, forms, styles, and subject matter in their classrooms upon their return to the United States. Given the current problem of preservice teachers entering teaching jobs with a lack of cultural understanding, these findings could contribute to positive social change by providing a practical approach for policy makers and universities to increase attention to promoting international volunteering and implementing cultural awareness in their curriculum.Download Free PDFView PDFThe State of State Associations ECAGina MarcelloDownload Free PDFView PDFPolicy RecommendationsCommission on Climate Change & Energy Final Report2018 • Kyle GraceyThere is no more sobering fact than that, to date, we live on the only planet in the cosmos that sustains life. And no more worrisome fact than that, to our best estimates, our actions have severely risked our future sustainability on this planet. Today we live in a geologic era dominated by human actions; scientists refer to this age as the Anthropocene epoch because the single greatest environmental force is the collective choices of humanity.Download Free PDFView PDFThe Spectacle of Volunteerism: Aid, Africa, and the Western HelperMichele DeramoHigher education makes the case for preparing students to live and work in a globalized world. Its methods for achieving this include, among other things, engaging students in community service. This essay focuses on the rise of service abroad experiences for college students for the purpose of interrogating the assumptions of intercultural competence and global awareness that are its presumed learning outcomes. What do students learn through these encounters constructed around themes of service? Is the learning reciprocated by an measureable benefit to the host sites? Or is volunteerism a spectacle that furthers a Western agenda through positive public relations?Download Free PDFView PDFI Don’t Want to Be the Well-Intentioned Enemy of YouthCarmen Hernandez-Ojeda109th Convention, Eastern Communication Association, Pittsburgh, PA, April 2018. In this performance autoethnography, I critically reflect upon my role as a researcher on youth bullying, the invisibility of youth’s transformative agency in dominant anti-bullying discourses, and the responsibility of such discourses in promoting the school-to-prison pipeline in the U.S. I likewise invite the audience—scholars in particular— to question their assumptions on youth bullying and co-participate in reframing this issue. Through reframing, youth’s voice and agency are fully recognized, adults embrace a process of transformative self-reflexivity, and adults and youth join forces to understand and prevent, together, peer abuse. A reframing in which adult commit to stop being the well-intentioned enemy of youth.Download Free PDFView PDFGlobal service-learning in institutions of higher education: Concerns from a community of practiceBenjamin Lough, Cynthia TomsIn order to better understand and determine priorities of global service-learning in higher education, this study used an empowering evaluation processes to assess the strategic trajectories needed for growth in this field. Researchers organised 36 focus groups during an international summit to map the strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities for global service-learning in higher education. These focus groups generated 121 summary statements, which were qualitatively coded and analysed to assess common themes. Participants identified six main needs that could strengthen the practice of global service-learning. These needs highlight common priorities and current dilemmas faced by the emerging field of global service-learning, and illustrate the priorities needed to move this field forward in the coming years.Download Free PDFView PDFLong and Short Views: Political and Policy Contexts for International EducationAlan RubyThe paper looks at claims that the U.S. is entering a period of isolationism as well as the importance of diversity and tolerance in education.
