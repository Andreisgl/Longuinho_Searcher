Between 4% and 8% of employment may be accounted for by cultural industries. Culture must be inclusively not exclusively defined, preferably along lines proposed by Raymond Williams as ‗ordinary' or by Clifford Geertz as a ‗meaning transfer process', in democratic policy making. Shopping, sports and science are thus equally valid candidates as instruments for developing a city's cultural assets. Cities need to be aware of for whom a cultural policy is meant. Particularly, ‗global capture' of assets (Temple Bar, Guggenheim, Millennium Stadium, Wimbledon) and politically expedient ‗multiculturalism' can alienate excluded citizens, including those of hinterlands. High quality architectural planning and a focus on ‗cultural quarters' accompanies successful city cultural policy (E.g. Bilbao, Dublin, Tallinn). The governance and funding of successful cultural policy is often multi-level in nature rather than stand-alone. International benchmarking and networks of support are also key. Comparison shows many cities in Europe to have significant cultural assets. Science and knowledge are being embraced as cultural benchmarks. Thus cultural assets are both historical and creatively reproduced as modern imagery. Media is the greatest and most common cultural cluster in the modern city, but hardly seen at all in the countryside.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersWhite, L. (2009) Images of Canberra: Destination Marketing and the Capital City of Australia. In R. Maitland and B. Ritchie (eds.) City Tourism: National Capital Perspectives. Oxfordshire: CAB International, pp 37-49.Leanne WhiteThis chapter examines visual representations (mediated images) of both Canberra and the marketing of Australia’s capital city. The chapter examines numerous signs and symbols surrounding the national capital and its marketing in 2008 and 2009. The key organizations involved in marketing Canberra are Australian Capital Tourism and the Canberra and Region Visitors Centre. These groups effectively control the way in which Canberra is marketed locally, nationally and internationally. The national symbolism associated with the nation’s capital is examined. Textual analysis, in particular semiotics (examining how signs generate meaning) is a useful methodology for deconstructing mediated representations of national imagery and branding. Some semiotic analysis will be undertaken to analyse the way in which images and perceptions of Australia’s national capital are imagined, created, represented, replicated and relayed across Australia and beyond. The images examined in this chapter are also explored through the dual theoretical frameworks of nationalism and destination marketing.Download Free PDFView PDFTechnology, Talent and Tolerance in European cities: A comparative analysisNick CliftonDownload Free PDFView PDFMai Abdo - Master Thesis - The “Open Cities” Approach a Prospect for Improving the Quality of Life in Alexandria City, EgyptMai AbdoDownload Free PDFView PDFEvent ManagementCapacity Building and the Contribution of Public Festivals Evaluating “Cardiff 2005” Clifton et al Event Management, Vol. 16, pp. 77–91Nick CliftonFestivals and special events are increasingly encouraged by urban policy makers as driving local (and regional) economic and cultural regeneration, with the consequent justification of public investment therein. This has led to an emerging need for deeper understanding of their contribution, and for evaluation beyond the purely economic. In order to explore these issues, the Cardiff 2005 festival is used as a case study. This initiative attracted £1.3 million from the Millennium Commission’s Urban Cultural Programme, matched by Cardiff City Council, to fund a year-long celebration of Cardiff’s centenary. This article, therefore, explores the significance of “fit for purpose” festival/ special event evaluation, highlighting critical issues in evaluation practice. Ultimately, although a cultural success, Cardiff 2005 represents something of a missed opportunity, in terms of both legacy and fit for purpose evaluation. It is suggested that this has implications for similar initiatives both in the UK and internationally.Download Free PDFView PDFTHE ART OF REGENERATION Urban Renewal through Cultural Activity By Charles Landry, Lesley Greene, Francois MatarassoFranco BianchiniDownload Free PDFView PDFTHE ART OF REGENERATION Urban Renewal through Cultural ActivityJosé Jesús Páez CamachoDownload Free PDFView PDFContribution that the cultural and creative industries can make to urban regenerationRonan PhilippotDownload Free PDFView PDFUrban StudiesUnpacking the theory-policy interface of local economic development: An analysis of Cardiff and Liverpool2007 • Philip  BolandDownload Free PDFView PDFCardiff: The Making and Development of the Capital City of WalesMartin  JohnesCapital cities are never static entities and their status is often contested or the subject of resentment elsewhere. Any history of capitals should thus extend beyond considering the built environment that has dominated its historiography and root itself in an understanding of popular attitudes and local political processes. Only then can the reality and significance of being a capital be properly understood. Cardiff’s claim, attainment and development as the Welsh capital city are clear illustrations of this. They demonstrate first the uncertainty and contested nature of Welsh identity and then the growing confidence that came to exist in Wales as the nation became a more meaningful administrative entity. That process might have reduced the dispute surrounding Cardiff’s capital status but it did not always endear the capital to the rest of Wales.
