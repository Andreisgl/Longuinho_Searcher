Public institutions, motivated by the need to increase their legitimacy, have increasingly delegated functions to CSOs. Concomitantly, CSOs have expanded their access to public funding. In part because of increased access to public funding, and in part because of a stronger relationship with public powers, CSOs are under pressure to demonstrate that they use the resources they are given in an efficient, accountable and transparent manner, e.g. by adopting policies on fiscal transparency, and by maintaining financial solvency. The EU's interest in regulating CSOs is relatively recent. At present, the legal framework addressing CSOs' financial accountability includes two 'categories' of norms: those that regulate the award of public contracts and the concession of grants, and those norms that address transparency and openness. The first category includes the rules on public contracts and the rules on (co-)financing of CSO projects; whereas the second category includes the Financial Transparency Initiative (FTJ) and the Joint Transparency Register(JTR). The FTJ gathers all information on EU funding in a single database. The JTR gathers information produced by the various organisations (including CSOs) that are interested in lobbying the EU, and who register voluntarily. Defining the boundaries of CSO fiscal accountability and effectively tackling cases of fraud or financial mismanagement remains a difficult endeavor. On the one hand, the EU still lacks a single overarching understanding (and, consequently, legal definition) of CSOs. This translates into the absence of clear legal definitions, and more generally intothe opacity of the information available on CSOs through EU databases. Moreover, as CSOs are 'private entities', they are not submitted to the same integrity mechanisms and norms that apply to public institutions, including internal and external oversight. Finally, a significant administrative burden imposed on CSOs may, in the end, counter EU efforts to tackle financial mismanagement by CSOs. In many respects, the issue of CSO financial accountability has come to resemble a dialogue of the deaf: EU institution-proposed reforms have been postponed, or have not produced the outcomes expected, or have been fiercely opposed by CSOs. At the same time, the self-regulatory tools (including policies on selecting donors, self monitoring and codes of conduct and standards) developed by CSOs to enhance theirfinancial accountability have not obtained official recognition from EU institutions.Save to LibraryDownloadby Gianluca Sgueo•  32  European History, European Studies, European integration, European LawAvoiding a New 'Cold War' The Future of EU-Russia Relations in the Context of the Ukraine CrisisSave to LibraryDownloadby Cristian Nitoiu•  16  Eastern European Studies, European Studies, Russian Studies, European integrationNord Stream 2Save to LibraryDownloadby Julia Kusznir•  4  European Energy Policy, Energy Security, European Foreign Policy, EnergieversorgungThe EU's Global Strategy in the Age of Brexit and 'America First'In June 2016, the European Union launched its new ‘Global Strategy for Foreign and Security Policy’.

In less unusual times, it would have been received as merely the latest iteration of the main tenets and ambitions of EU external action, this time with an enhanced dose of pragmatism to respond to a more challenging international environment. However, with the contours of ‘Brexit’ becoming clearer and the start of the Trump Presidency in the United States, the EU’s Global Strategy has acquired a whole new level of significance. This paper argues that while meant to express a largely uncontroversial consensus, it now needs to be recontextualized as a distinctive vision in the face of trends of anti-globalism and Euroscepticism. This concerns in particular its emphasis on rules-based global governance. Challenged by both President Trump ‘America First’ policy and the British government’s course for a ‘hard Brexit’, the Global Strategy represents a blueprint and rallying point for a continued pursuit of a liberal world order based on the rule of law.Save to LibraryDownloadby Joris  Larik•  45  International Relations, Climate Change, International Studies, International LawTheory of the Border (Oxford University Press, 2016)There are more types of borders today than ever before in history.

Borders of all kinds define every aspect of social life in the twenty-first century. From the biometric data that divides the smallest aspects of our bodies to the aerial drones that patrol the immense expanse of our domestic and international airspace, we are defined by borders. They can no longer simply be understood as the geographical divisions between nation-states. Today, their form and function has become too complex, too hybrid. What we need now is a theory of the border that can make sense of this hybridity across multiple domains of social life. Rather than viewing borders as the result or outcome of pre-established social entities like states, Thomas Nail reinterprets social history from the perspective of the continual and constitutive movement of the borders that organize and divide society in the first place. Societies and states are the products of bordering, Nail argues, not the other way around. Applying his original movement-oriented theoretical framework "kinopolitics" to several major historical border regimes (fences, walls, cells, and checkpoints), Theory of the Border pioneers a new methodology of "critical limology," that provides fresh tools for the analysis of contemporary border politics.Save to LibraryDownloadby Thomas Nail•  247  Critical Theory, European History, Cultural History, Cultural StudiesSINO-EUROPEAN RELATIONS DURING THE COLD WAR AND THE RISE OF A MULTIPOLAR WORLDThis publication is the fruit of a one-of-a-kind conference, which took place in Palermo, Italy, in 2012.

The conference brought together veteran diplomats from Albania, China, Italy, Poland, Romania, and the United Kingdom, and paired them face-to-face with historians from around the world. For several days, participants engaged in what is known as “critical oral history.” Methodologically, critical oral history allows for substantive dialogue between foreign policy practitioners and scholars. It allows participants to go beyond and challenge individual recollections and to fill in the blank spots in the historical record. The dialogue that took place between former officials and the scholars in Palermo was unique, making this a milestone event in the discipline. What is perhaps most interesting about this volume is that the wealth of information and perspectives contained herewith have not been publically accessible before. This arises from the volume’s unique composition. It combines translations of formerly secret documents from ten different countries, with the rich oral history testimonies of ambassadors and diplomats from nearly as many nations. History could hardly be more international than how it is presented here.The new data collected here is all the more valuable because the subject matter, Sino-European relations during the Cold War, is so fascinating, so timely, and so relevant. The “socialization” between China and the West in 1960s and 1970s, examined exhaustively in this volume, still weighs heavily on the international system today. Why? If the bipolar system of the 1960s and 1970s was marked by superpower détente, the parallel tentative emergence of a new order—an increasingly multipolar world—was grounded in the dialogue between middle powers: China and Europe. As this volume demonstrates, Sino-European interaction and the resulting transformation of the Cold War order were the outcomes of Europe’s forward thinking diplomacy and Beijing’s genuine desire for independence on the international stage. De Gaulle’s vision of French grandeur inaugurated Europe’s overture to Beijing in 1960s. Later, the universalist impulses of and the emphasis on inclusiveness in Italian foreign policy found fertile ground in the ashes of the Cultural revolution. These and other shifts in the European political landscape added a normative horizon to Europe’s diplomatic contacts with Beijing and opened the door to Beijing’s return to the broader family of nations, thanks to its participation to the United Nations since the 1970s.Presenting profound insights into the diplomatic paths that determined these historical transformations, this volume is not just useful for seasoned academics. It is also highly instructive for the new generation of diplomats. It is this generation which must appreciate how the different political cultures of Europe and China affect relations today, but it also this generation that ought to understand the shared history between Europe and China and its role in shaping the challenging times we live in.Save to LibraryDownloadby Enrico Fardella•  5  History, International Relations, Cold War, European Foreign Policy2013 Representing Enlarging European Union: Hegemony, Change and the Visegrad PerspectivesThis study focuses on the European Union’s (EU) discursive construction, and representation in the process of its enlargement.

It problematizes the presently common tendency of doing so in ways which portray EU expansion as an expansion of Europe. At issue are thus practices conflating and equating the EU and Europe which pervade much of related academic, political and public debates and discourses, and so structure how we know of and imagine enlarging EU. Embracing post-structuralist and discourse-theoretical analytical and interpretative framework, this work points to the political character of representing the EU in this and, for that matter, any other fashion. Pursuit of this assertion necessitates a ‘step back’ from, and critical consideration of mainstream political and scholarly presuppositions concerning the Union and its enlargement in their arbitrariness. The very problematization of practices equating the EU and Europe, or of their allied ‘Europe-building’ concept of ‘European identity’, is conceivable and ‘meaningful’ only once we admit that these are not politically innocent components of an ‘objective’ grasp on ‘present’ or ‘emergent’ social realities in Europe and the EU but instead ‘merely’ value-laden interpretative possibilities biased in favour of the EU-official federalist integration project. Anticipating a divergence in conceptions and portrayals of the Union by senior EU members, elite and institutions on the one hand, and the new post-communist Member States on the other, this study examines national discursive spaces in the so-called Visegrad countries. On the basis of this extensive empirical enquiry, it reports rather distinctive understandings of the EU/European integration therein, affirming thus the suspected dissonance from the EU mainstream. They are attributed to several factors, considerations and concerns which are posited to be very likely shared more widely among post-communist member countries. The Visegrad societies’ conceptions of the EU and of its relation to Europe converge on a number of crucial points. These can be seen and interpreted as combining into a latent alternative European integration project which envisions persisting primacy of national identifications and maintenance of the current social and political organization of European space. The EU is conceived of as enlarging common political superstructure of Europe of nations and their states rather than a certain culture-bound, ‘thicker’ community of ‘post-national’ subjects of a ‘pan-European’ federal entity with centre in Brussels. The study challenges in this context the prevalent political and scholarly tendency to reduce debates on and contention over the character and future of European integration to a binary conflict between the so-called ‘Euroenthusiasts’ vs. ‘Eurosceptics’. Building on insights of Lacanian psychoanalysis as deployed by discourse theorists, it suggests that it may be precisely the suppressed democratic conflict of competing visions and projects of European integration which greatly contributes to the lacking popular identification with the process and the EU, and prompts some ‘obscene’ or more ‘excessive’ expressions of discontent with it.Save to LibraryDownloadby Pavel Senderák•  17  European Studies, European integration, European Foreign Policy, European UnionIs the UK making itself a target for Russian retaliationMoscow will be irritated by the stridency of UK's support for Ukraine and might contemplate singling it out for specific action.

By looking at the international missions in Kosovo (those of the UN and particularly the EU), we problematize how the EU mission in Kosovo is entrenched in a trajectory of ‘missionizing’ that makes it bear the stigma of a structure non-responsive and non-sensitive to the local. Employing Derrida’s deconstruction, we explain that the criticism (academic, dogmatic, ideological and empirical) of international missions relates not so much to how they operate in their host countries, or to the policy choices they make. Rather, looking at the path dependency of missions in the Western historical and civilizational trajectory, we maintain that the problem derives from the idea and very concept of ‘mission’ as intervention in itself.Save to LibraryDownloadby Jan Orbie•  13  European Studies, Metaphysics, European integration, Political ScienceBosnia’s Slow EuropeanisationThe European Union (EU) has closely correlated different aspects of the peace process in Bosnia with progress towards European accession.

The ‘power of attraction’ of EU membership would presumably induce the Bosnian authorities to accept the adaptation costs of political and economic transformation. However, the Europeanisation approach has not produced the expected results. The track record of the EU’s policies towards Bosnia represents a paradigmatic case of what would happen if almost nothing works as efficiently as in the case of the countries that joined the EU in 2004 and 2007. The article investigates the causes of EU policy failure in Bosnia and claims that the EU has not effectively responded to three challenges: 1) adjust the process to the needs of an ethnically divided post-war state; 2) preserve the credibility of accession conditionality, and 3) convey the proper messages on how to comply with EU rules. Therefore, the article argues for a more cohesive and consistent EU approach towards Bosnia.Save to Libraryby Nikolaos Tzifakis•  98  Eastern European Studies, European Studies, International Relations, MulticulturalismThe Geopolitics of Pandemic-related Assistance to the Western BalkansSave to LibraryDownloadby Nikolaos Tzifakis•  20  European History, Development Studies, Geopolitics, Balkan StudiesThe Western Balkans in the World: Linkages and Relations with Non-Western CountriesThis book provides a detailed understanding of how different types of engagements impact upon the reform and EU integration of the Western Balkan region.

It examines the influence of Russia, China, Turkey and the UAE in the region and analyses the range of existing links.Contributors offer an academic and multifaceted perspective of the role of external and non-Western actors in the region that goes beyond, on the one hand, the tendency of some Western decision makers to perceive all engagement by third powers as a sinister threat and, on the other, the view of regional governments of all external involvement as a boon coming at a time of Western neglect and reduced foreign investments. By looking at the importance of Russia, Turkey, China and the UAE in the Western Balkans, the book sheds light on one key arena of global competition, offers new insights on the strengths and weaknesses of Euro–Atlantic integration and advances our knowledge of foreign policy and its economic, social and security dimensions for small and medium-sized countries.Save to LibraryDownloadby Florian Bieber and +1Nikolaos Tzifakis•  20  European Studies, South East European Studies, Balkan Studies, KosovoThe European Union in Kosovo: Reflecting on the Credibility and Efficiency DeficitSave to LibraryDownloadby Nikolaos Tzifakis•  101  Languages, Eastern European Studies, European Studies, International RelationsThe Western Balkans as a Geopolitical Chessboard?

This warrants a forward-looking conceptual analysis on how to properly address Europe’s internal and external challenges and a bold and visionary approach. Instead of proposals that focus on current shortcomings, we encourage submissions that propose new, hands-on approaches to tackling Europe’s challenges in an innovative and future-oriented way, or pieces that revisit existing but promising approaches that were never put into practice. Additionally, in asking ourselves how we ought to shape the future of Europe, we also need to inquire how we will be studying EU law in the future.

Cristian Nitoiu identifies three perceived security threats implied by developments in Ukraine and how these threats may develop in future years: the threat of so called 'hybrid warfare' spilling over from the standoff between Ukraine and Russia; the threat posed by nuclear weapons; and the threat posed by more conventional forms of warfare. Perceptions of security threats are arguably more salient than actual threats, most times having a deep influence on the actions of states and other international actors. Hence, they play a key role in the way the EU, Kyiv and Moscow will shape their policies towards each other in the wake of the Ukraine crisis. While Russia can employ a wide range of capabilities, the EU and Ukraine have very few instruments to tackle security threats, be they traditional or non­traditional. In the case of Ukraine, but also more broadly the post­Soviet space, EU­Russia/Ukraine relations are affected by the perception of three types of security threats: so called 'hybrid warfare', nuclear threats and traditional military threats (i.e. territorial invasion). Hybrid warfare In the West and Ukraine the perception of the threat posed by hybrid war has recently increased sharply. The annexation of Crimea and the war in eastern Ukraine have put the spotlight on the way states engage in conflict by using a series of (sometimes innovative) tools and strategies. Hybrid war combines the use of conventional and non­conventional capabilities, the use of irregular troops, cyber­attacks, support for terrorist, rebel and criminal groups, or the use of the media and civil society for propaganda purposes. In eastern Ukraine in particular we have witnessed a combination of the use of both state and non­state actors by all the sides involved. States tend to use parts of this toolkit even in times of peace, however in such situations these instruments are not combined in order to pursue certain assertive foreign policy goals.Save to LibraryDownloadby Cristian Nitoiu•  16  Eastern European Studies, Russian Studies, Foreign Policy Analysis, International SecurityUS and EU sanctions against Russia.

In this landmark book, three eminent historians bring to life the complex and tumultuous relations between Genoans and Tunisians, Alexandrians and the people of Constantinople, Catalans and Maghrebis--the myriad groups and individuals whose stories reflect the common cultural, intellectual, and religious heritage of Europe and Islam. Since the seventh century, when the armies of Constantinople and Medina fought for control of Syria and Palestine, there has been ongoing contact between the Muslim world and the West. This sweeping history vividly recounts the wars and the crusades, the alliances and diplomacy, commerce and the slave trade, technology transfers, and the intellectual and artistic exchanges. Here readers are given an unparalleled introduction to key periods and events, including the Muslim conquests, the collapse of the Byzantine Empire, the commercial revolution of the medieval Mediterranean, the intellectual and cultural achievements of Muslim Spain, the crusades and Spanish reconquest, the rise of the Ottomans and their conquest of a third of Europe, European colonization and decolonization, and the challenges and promise of this entwined legacy today. As provocative as it is groundbreaking, this book describes this shared history in all its richness and diversity, revealing how ongoing encounters between Europe and Islam have profoundly shaped both.&amp;amp;amp;quot;Save to Libraryby Arno Tausch•  20  Cultural History, Cultural Studies, Arabic Literature, CultureVom "umfassenden" zum "integrierten Ansatz": notwendige Schritte zur Weiterentwicklung der EU-Außenbeziehungen am Beispiel der Sahelzone und des Horns von AfrikaSave to LibraryDownloadby Ronja  Kempin•  9  Security, European Foreign Policy, Horn of Africa, European Union external relationsAmérica Latina, el Caribe y la Unión Europea en 2020: perspectivas y oportunidadesSave to LibraryDownloadby José Antonio Sanahuja•  7  Latin American Foreign Policy, European Foreign Policy, Regionalism, EU Foreign PolicyThe Jordan-EU Association Agreement, Analysis of Process and Outcome 1999Save to LibraryDownloadby Yusuf Mansur•  5  European Studies, Development Economics, International Trade, European Foreign PolicyThe European Union and International Criminal Justice: Living Up to Its Normative Preferences?Save to LibraryDownloadby Elena Aoun•  4  European Foreign Policy, European Union (International Studies), European Union external relations, International Criminal Law; International Criminal JusticeEspaña y la doctrina del multilateralismo eficaz.

En este mundo cambiante, este libro explora el concepto de «multilateralismo eficaz» impulsado por el PSOE, por el cual España abandonó el apoyo incondicional de Estados Unidos y abordó una serie de colaboraciones multilaterales con regiones de todo el mundo.Exhaustivo y completo, España y la doctrina del multilateralismo eficaz ofrece una nueva historia internacional de la España contemporánea.

We focus on various forms of travel writing, media reporting, diplomatic record, policy making, truth claims and expert accounts related to different narrative perspectives on the Balkan wars, both old (1912-1913) and new (1991-1999). We show how these perspectives are rooted in different temporalities and historicizations, and how they contribute to international representations that affect international politics, particularly in relation to perpetuating othering and containment of Southeast Europe. We demonstrate through a detailed analysis and problematization how these international representations are culturally and politically constructed. They do not neutrally refer to a reality in the world; they create a reality of their own. As such, how international representations are constructed is itself a form of power and hegemony in both the practice and the theory of international relations.Save to LibraryDownloadby Albert Doja•  20  European Studies, Anthropology, International Relations, Social AnthropologyRobert Schuman: The Father of United Europe (in Hebrew)Introduction to the Hebrew translation of Robert Schuman's book "For Europe"Save to LibraryDownloadby Sharon Pardo and +1Hila Zahavi•  16  European History, European Studies, European integration, European LawThe Parliamentary Dimension of North Macedonia's Accession to the European UnionThe short brief analyses the new dynamics in the new EU legislature on EU enlargement to the Western Balkans, its impact on the EU’s perspective to North Macedonia, and the role of the Assembly of North Macedonia in pushing for the... moreThe short brief analyses the new dynamics in the new EU legislature on EU enlargement to the Western Balkans, its impact on the EU’s perspective to North Macedonia, and the role of the Assembly of North Macedonia in pushing for the country’s European perspective.Save to LibraryDownloadby Isabelle Ioannides•  14  European Studies, European integration, Balkan Studies, Foreign PolicyCall for Papers "Shaping the Future of Europe"Europe is at a crossroads: Although there is regular talk of crisis, trust in the European Union remains stable and there is a strong upwards trend regarding its positive image (the latest Standard-Eurobarometer 90 shows a record high).... moreEurope is at a crossroads: Although there is regular talk of crisis, trust in the European Union remains stable and there is a strong upwards trend regarding its positive image (the latest Standard-Eurobarometer 90 shows a record high).

These processes imply that the subjects of the EU’s influence adopt and internalize the norms and practices formulated by the Union. By requiring a reconsideration of the meanings of sovereignty and the adoption of certain rules forinteractions suggested by a foreign center of power, Europeanization can be considered as a hegemonic project.The European Union as a whole operates with a broad conception of international security, leaving the concerns over its narrow, military meanings to the member states. As part of the influence it exercises through the Europeanization process, the EU identitiessome nontraditional threats (trafficking, terrorism, migration, etc.) as relevant tointernational security and formulates policies aimed to address them.

Transparency, efficiency and accountability, rubber-stamped in official papers and declarations, are superseded by other standards: informal networks, patronage, and a patron-client system are what truly shape the performance of state institutions, making them serve the interests of the elected rather than the electors. The article traces the rise of Viktor Yanukovych to the Presidential office through extensive use of these informal patterns and formation of a vertikal of his own, laying preconditions for his fall.Save to LibraryDownloadby Yegor Vasylyev•  20  Eastern European Studies, Russian Studies, International Relations, GeopoliticsThe EU Enlargement Policy in the Polish political discourse after 2004, in: THE EUROPEAN UNION - A NEW START?

Polish public opinion and elites expressed very high level of support for the Polish membership in the EU and after 2004 high level of positive evaluations of membership. From the very first years in the block the opinions on enlargement expressed by Polish elites vary depending on which countries were concerned as well as how they were defining the EU. In order to present attitudes toward enlargement the article goes as follows. Firstly we will discuss the general characteristics of the Polish political discourse on European integration. In the second part we will analyse the opinions on further EU enlargement in the period between 2004-2014 in two sets of data. The analysis of the programs of the political parties will be presented as regards the position of Polish political parties regarding enlargement. This will be complemented with the analysis of the opinions on enlargement of Polish Members of the European Parliament (MEP) as expressed in 6th and 7th term in office of the European Parliament (EP).Save to LibraryDownloadby Natasza  Styczynska and +1Magdalena  Gora•  7  European Studies, European integration, Political Parties, European Foreign PolicyCritical Review Blair, Tony (2010).

Yet past priorities continued to occupy an important place in the foreign policy of this small state. Drawing on the literature on Europeanization, this paper examines the impact of European Union membership on Portuguese foreign policy by focusing on the case of Mozambique, one of Portugal’s largest former colonies in sub-Saharan Africa. Pointing to some national adaptation, the findings highlight Lisbon’s important efforts to project its priorities onto the EU level and preserve some freedom of maneuver in relation to its ex-colony. This study brings a more in-depth and nuanced picture of the EU’s impact on Portuguese foreign policy than the one usually found in the existing literature. Moreover, it corroborates the usefulness of the concept of Europeanization to explore the specific European dynamics that influence and shape the national foreign policies of EU member states.Save to LibraryDownloadby António Raimundo•  9  European Studies, Foreign Policy Analysis, Portuguese Studies, European Foreign PolicyLa Unión Europea y la Agenda 2030 en América Latina: políticas de cooperación en una región de “desarrollo en transición”La cooperación al desarrollo de la Unión Europea (UE) atraviesa por un importante proceso de reforma ante el ciclo presupuestario y de programación 2021-2027.

Esa reforma pretende dotar a la UE de los recursos y herramientas necesarios para conciliar sus valores e intereses ante un escenario más complejo, disputado e interconectado y, al tiempo, contribuir a una cooperación eficaz para alcanzar los Objetivos de Desarrollo Sostenible (ODS) de la Agenda 2030. Este documento de trabajo examina ese proceso de reforma a partir de las características diferenciadas de los países relativamente más avanzados de América Latina, más allá de clasificaciones de renta, y, en particular, su situación de “desarrollo en transición”.

However, the acronym is frequently heard in Brussels, recently. So, what is really PESCO? A major innovation of the Treaty Establishing a Constitution for Europe, when it was rewritten in the Treaty of Lisbon, PESCO was distorted and became illegible. Therefore, in order to understand what it really is, one needs to rediscover the original spirit of the preparatory works which led to it writing.

Following an overview of the development of EU foreign policy decision-making processes, the work analyses how these were applied in the case of Kosovo. It shows that while significant efforts were made to reach a united position on the question of recognition, these efforts eventually proved to be unsuccessful. The EU Member States ultimately agreed to the establishment of a law and order mission for Kosovo. To some, this was a success, but it cannot disguise the fact that procedural changes in the EU’s foreign policy decision-making do not cover up for diverging Member State interests and that the EU was unable to take charge of what was essentially a European issue.Save to LibraryDownloadby James  Ker-Lindsay and +1Spyros Economides•  8  Peace and Conflict Studies, International Studies, Conflict, KosovoLa construction européenne contribue-t-elle à la paix?Les partisans de la construction européenne ont toujours avancé que celle-ci avait amené la paix.

Pourtant, aucune étude scientifique n’ajamais développé une approche critique d’une telle prétention. Pourremédier à cette surprenante lacune, l’auteur établit une typologie quipermet de reconstituer les deux conceptions principales qui s’opposentautour de cette question : celle des européistes et celle des eurosceptiques.La confrontation dialectique entre ces deux approches constituele fil rouge de l’ouvrage. Reprise dans chacun des chapitres, ellepermet, de dégager un point de vue synthétique visant à dépasser cetteopposi tion. L’auteur montre que la contribution de la constructioneuropéenne à la paix se situe dans les nuances, se démarquant ainsides slogans irénistes des européistes tout en démontant les argumentsdes eurosceptiques. Il conclut que l’UE ne pourra jamais empêcherdes dérives extrémistes et belligènes.

As its role expands in the international system, China is forced to re-evaluate its identity and preferences, choosing to selectively remember or forget symbols and representations of the past and present. Transitioning from a developing country to an important member of the international system, its self-image has undergone a dramatic revolution. The EU meanwhile, has expanded from an EC-9 of similar Western democracies in 1973 to an EU-27 of diverse countries by 2007. Its attempt to develop a distinctive European presence in world affairs – that of ‘normative power’ Europe; set it on a course of collision with China. These changes in identity have important consequences for actions and foreign policy interactions. We can thus expect China-EU relations to develop in the context of the ongoing redefinition of their identities and roles in the evolving international order. Both China and the EU will likely continue to respond to each other according to the needs and demands of their respective populations, and to the external expectations placed on them as important players in global politics, diplomacy, economics, trade, finance and security.Save to LibraryDownloadby Reuben Wong•  6  Identity politics, Nationalism, European Foreign Policy, National IdentityIn search of a structure: the EU’s foreign policy strategy against the background of a missing global orderAlgieri and Kammel describe the evolution of the global power structure after the end of the Cold War equilibrium between the United States and the Soviet Union.

The 1990s represented a period of intense global change marked by two realities: the dominant role of the US and the difficulty of defining a multipolar balance. The establishment of a multipolar equilibrium will necessarily include Asia’s growing forces—India and China—and Russia, whereas the role of the EU remains uncertain.Save to LibraryDownloadby Arnold Kammel•European Foreign PolicyNextLast »Related TopicsEuropean integrationFollowFollowingEuropean UnionFollowFollowingEuropean StudiesFollowFollowingEuropean PoliticsFollowFollowingEuropean Security and Defence PolicyFollowFollowingEuropean Foreign and Security PolicyFollowFollowingEuropean Union external relationsFollowFollowingEU Foreign PolicyFollowFollowingInternational RelationsFollowFollowingEuropean Union PoliticsFollowFollowing 71.6 million researchers use this site every month.
