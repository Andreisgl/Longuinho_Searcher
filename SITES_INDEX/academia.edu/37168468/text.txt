In particular, the paper dwells on the transformation of motor racing into a collective myth, in accordance with Marinetti's celebration of speed. The texts arranged by Barthes for the documentary directed by Aubert Aquin (Les sport et les hommes, 1960-1961) enable an analysis of the diffusion of sports as a mere collective business. Therefore, the paper revolves around Barthes' ability to elaborate a theoretical framework suitable for the study of contemporary myths, in line with the Futurist " beauty of speed ". Juan Manuel Fangio embodied the real social myth, nowadays enhanced by Luis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel. The latter won the 2018 edition of the F1 Canadian Gp forty years after Gilles Villeneuve reached his first victory. The deaths of Villeneuve and Senna and Schumacher's serious injury attest that speed has become an effective social myth, suspended between risks and immortality.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersItalian Futurist Art: the relationship between creation and destruction reassessedKristina RimkuteDownload Free PDFView PDFThe " futurist " aesthetics of ISISthorsten botz-bornsteinISIS propaganda differs from that of other (Islamic or non-Islamic) religions or cults as it is not so much concerned with imagination and exotic fantasies but accentuates the maximal exploitation and demonstration of available technology. The Islamic State does not only excel through the extensive use of high-tech weapons, social media, commercial bot, and automated text systems; by putting forward the presence of speeding cars and tanks, mobile phones, and computers, ISIS presents jihad life as connected to modern urban culture. The article shows that the aesthetics of the Islamic State is “futurist” by comparing it with Italian Futurism. Futurism glorified cars, industrial machines, and modern cities while praising violence as a means of leaving behind imitations of the past in order to project itself most efficiently into the future. A profound sense of crisis produces in both Futurism and jihadism a nihilistic attitude toward the present state of society that will be overcome through an exaltation of technology. The futurist project to integrate life and art is paralleled by ISIS’s desire to integrate life and religion. In both cases the result is achieved through violence.Download Free PDFView PDFElizabeth Bowen and the Futurist ImaginationKeri WalshDownload Free PDFView PDFInternational Yearbook of Futurism StudiesThe Futurist Concept of 'Man Extended by Machines'2018 • Ekaterina LazarevaInspired by images of the new industrial order and the modern city, Marinetti described how the labouring masses will enter the 'Kingdom of the Machine', but rarely addressed the world of factory production and the organization of work processes. This essay concentrates on specific aspects of the 'machine myth' in Italian Futurism in its relation to politics, industrial work and the scientific organization of labour. It relates the Futurist's interest in motion studies to life in real factories. The 'man extended by machines' - a key concept in Futurist aesthetics is discussed here in the context of human-machine interaction and the implications it had in the Russian avant-garde, especially in the fields of 'biomechanics' and the 'Taylorization' of theatrical production. Drawing on Meyerhold's post-revolutionary theatrical practices and Paladini/ Pannaggi's Mechanical Ballet (1922), as well as theoretical writings by Eisenstein, Marinetti and Azari, this essay shows how the notion of an extended human body turning into a machine entered performance practices in both Italy and Russia. The Futurist 'myth of the machine' also had wider repercussions because it claimed a continuous progress in the physiological and intellectual domain. It thus became an important element of Futurist artificial optimism.

When a continuous action was broken into its constituent elements, it was observed that continuity could also be described as a kinesis of sequential iterations. Advance use of machinery allowed sophisticated tasks to be analysed in detail to construct its building components to formulate a fabrication system. Consequently, futurist artists were heavily inspired by the flourishing technological advancements in the early 20th century and portrayed these inspirations in the various forms of art. However, due to its provocative uncanny manners, Futurism Art has not been embraced extensively in the scope of art discourse. Despite its far-right political connotations, futurism art has been influential in many art forms and techniques including Computational Generative Arts. In this paper, the author aims to explore aesthetic constituents and procedural methodologies shared between Futurism Art and Computational Generative Art. The code generated art aesthetics will be in the focus of this study to inspect similarities between the examples of Futurism Art and the contemporary generative artworks built with creative coding methodologies. Major artworks from Futurist Art movement will be investigated and their associations with generative manifestations will be analyzed with respect to computational systems.Download Free PDFView PDFFascist Aesthetics: Violence and its Usage in Modernism 1910-1930Jonathan F CarsonThere are well documented studies of the troubling fascination with totalitarianism and/or fascism which many of the modernists maintained or, at the least, entertained following the First World War, from T.S. Eliot’s conservatism, to Wyndham Lewis’ flirtation with Nazi sympathies, to Ezra Pound’s advocation of (and propaganda regarding) fascism. An obvious effect of the fragmented social state of Europe following the war years, this desire for a new sense of order proves intriguing. Having lost any remaining residual faith in their current government structures—both democratic and socialist—having lost faith in divine providence, and loath to return to, instigate, or reinvigorate laissez-faire policies, modernists such as these representative few latched onto the control and social order which totalitarian theories promised. If God could not determine humanity’s fate, man would have to suffice. And man proved a less than worthy surrogate. Rather than questions to be explored, I propose to enlarge upon this conceit and the anxieties and fears underlying its motivation, utilizing the works of these authors (and analyses of their works), historians, and scholars of the era stretching from 1910-1930 to detail the processes by which totalitarian measures became an acceptable solution to disorder. Through such comparisons, I hope to document the ideological similarities between modernism and fascism which compelled some modernists to embrace the ethos of totalitarianism and fascism. Evaluating the structures, methodologies, and ideologies of fascism as it was practiced and heralded in Germany and Italy with the methodologies, artistic output, and attributes of the modernist movement in Anglo-American letters and in Italian Futurism, a significant correspondence can be discerned between these seemingly disparate movements of the period stretching from 1910-1930. By focusing on literary modernism as both a material and aesthetic structure, an underlying current of totalitarian approbation can be detected and which can be equated with fascist sympathy in that both were simultaneously looking forward and backward, inclined to manufacture a future history/identity predicated upon a mythic past, and seeking to rejuvenate a dilapidated cultural zeitgeist. As such, fascism and aesthetic modernism can be understood as revitalization movements that arose as a result of myriad social, artistic, and political crises, some of which will be examined herein. Understanding the factors which can lead to the rise or popularity of any extremist philosophies is an essential tool in working to ensure such inhumanities never again occur. This essay attempts just that purpose, while, at the same time, hopes to provide insight into the critical and literary work of some of modernism’s most accomplished writers and theorists. At its core, this examination intends to present a broad overview of the era, its social disorder, the socioeconomic and political factors, and the resultant responses of some of its literary figuresDownload Free PDFView PDFInternational Yearbook of Futurism StudiesThe War Diaries of Filippo Tommaso Marinetti and Ernst Jünger2012 • Andrea BenedettiDownload Free PDFView PDFfascist aesthetics violence and its usage in modernism 1910-1930.pdfJonathan F CarsonThere are well documented studies of the troubling fascination with totalitarianism and/or fascism which many of the modernists maintained or, at the least, entertained following the First World War, from T.S.

MerjianLuca Buvoli's single-channel video, Velocity Zero (2007-9) features various sufferers of aphasia – the brain disorder affecting speech (and often cognition) – as they read aloud the eleven points of F.T. Marinetti's ‘Founding and Manifesto of Futurism’ (1909). First screened at the Venice Biennale in 2007 as part of a larger installation, this revision of Futurism – on the eve of its centenary – entails a literal re-reading of the movement's founding text. Combining live-action footage overlaid with animation, and filmed in both English and Italian versions, Velocity Zero unstitches the movement's ostensibly streamlined poetics. In the mouths of these readers, the manifesto's language is decelerated, elided, pulled apart, giving the lie to a Futurist dream of dehumanized speech and speed. Yet many of the readings approximate Marinettian principles even as they undercut them; involuntary slips and omissions wrest a new poetics from imperative fiats. Buvoli's work thus sets into relief some vital, if unlikely, affinities: between physiological disability and avant-garde prowess, between clinical diagnosis and critical methodology. Velocity Zero restores to Futurist pronouncements the fraught embodiment of language. But it also suggests the extent to which the movement – like modernism at large – was haunted by linguistic demolition from the start.Download Free PDFView PDFA "Modern Rendezvous" in London: Painters, Pilots, and Edward Wadsworth's 'A Short Flight'Bernard VereFor open access full-text, click the link. Edward Wadsworth’s 'A Short Flight' was first exhibited in June 1914 and reproduced in the Vorticist journal 'Blast' later that summer. Vorticism’s leader, Wyndham Lewis, had spent the time leading up to the inaugural publication of Blast trying to differentiate the English movement from Italian Futurism, and did so by adopting a more sceptical attitude in the face of Futurism’s technophilia. Accordingly, 'A Short Flight' has been read as a painting that portrays the individual as subservient to the mechanized world. Disputing that interpretation, this article resituates 'A Short Flight' in the context of aviation in London before the First World War, when 120,000 people attended the meeting at Hendon Aerodrome over the Easter weekend of 1914. Moreover, four pilots flying at Hendon were amongst the names that the Vorticists “Blessed” in 'Blast'. Fellow painters and patrons flew from the venue, which quickly assumed the status of a fashionable “modern rendezvous”. Coming in the wake of F. T. Marinetti’s description of his flight over Milan in the “Technical Manifesto of Futurist Literature”, but anticipating the response of Futurism’s own painters to the theme of aviation, Hendon made the ideal subject for a painting that contested Futurism’s claims to be the art of the modern metropolis.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
