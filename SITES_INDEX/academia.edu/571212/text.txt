TeixeiraThe purpose of the present study was to assess the factor structure and reliability of the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS-21) in a large Portuguese community sample. Participants were 1020 adults (585 women and 435 men), with a mean age of 36.74 (SD = 11.90) years. All scales revealed good reliability, with Cronbach’s alpha values between .80 (anxiety) and .84 (depression). The internal consistency of the total score was .92. Confirmatory factor analysis revealed that the best-fitting model (*CFI = .940, *RMSEA = .038) consisted of a latent component of general psychological distress (or negative affectivity) plus orthogonal depression, anxiety and stress factors. The Portuguese version of the DASS-21 showed good psychometric properties (factorial validity and reliability) and thus can be used as a reliable and valid instrument for measuring depression, anxiety and stress symptoms.Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of Affective DisordersThe structure of emotional symptoms in the postpartum period: Is it unique?2013 • Andrew C Page, Nadia CunninghamDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Abnormal Child PsychologyThe Structure of Anxiety and Depression in a Normative Sample of Younger and Older Australian Adolescents2009 • Phillip TullyIt has been reported that depression and anxiety have overlapping symptoms and are conceptually interrelated. One of the most prominent theoretical developments that explain this association is Clark and Watson’s tripartite model (Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 100:316–336, 1991) that posits these two disorders and negative emotions share a latent component of negative affect (NA). The current study had two aims, (a) to compare a tripartite factor structure against competing models by Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) of the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS-21) (Lovibond and Lovibond 1995), and (b) explore the psychometric properties of the DASS-21. The DASS-21 was completed by a representative sample of 4039 young Australians, aged 12–18 years, as part of the South Australian Youth Mental Health Survey (SAYMHS), South Australia, Australia. The best fitting model for the data consisted of anhedonic depression, physiological hyperarousal, and general NA. The psychometric properties of the DASS-21 were excellent with a stable and interpretable factor structure and good internal consistency. The results of the current study suggest that the theoretical tripartite structure of depression and anxiety is robust and applicable among Australian youth. The diagnostic, clinical and theoretical implications of these findings are discussed.Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of adolescenceThe short version of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21): Factor structure in a young adolescent sample2010 • Marianna SzabóDownload Free PDFView PDFPsychological AssessmentAssessment of the depression, anxiety, and stress scale (DASS-21) in untreated obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)2016 • sergio starksteinDownload Free PDFView PDFAnxiety Depression Distress Inventory-27 (ADDI-27): A Short Version of the Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire-90Augustine OsmanThe authors conducted three studies to construct and examine the psychometric properties of a 27-item version of the Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire-90 (MASQ-90; Watson & Clark, 1991a). The Anxiety Depression Distress Inventory-27 (ADDI-27) contains three empirically derived scales: Positive Affect, Somatic Anxiety, and General Distress, which are relevant dimensions of the tripartite model of affect. Each scale is composed of nine items, and the estimate of scale reliability for each scale score was Z.80 across the three studies. Results of exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses provided adequate support for a 3-factor model. Additional estimates of concurrent validity documented the ADDI-27 scales' convergent and discriminant validity. We also identified three construct relevant correlates for each scale score. Overall, the ADDI-27 appears to be a content valid, reliable, and multidimensional measure of the tripartite model of affect. Concerns regarding the nature and structure of depression and anxiety have received extensive attention in the extant literature (Watson proposed the tripartite model of affect to address some of the concerns regarding the high overlap between anxiety and depression in self-report and clinical data. In particular, the domains of the tripartite model are characterized by symptoms of internalizing disorders: positive affect, negative affect, and anxious-arousal (i.e., physiological hyperarousal). Clinically, low positive affect responses (i.e., the absence of positive affect symptoms such as felt happy, felt optimistic, and felt good) are indicative of depression, and high-level anxious arousal responses (e.g., felt dizzy, hands were shaky, and trouble swallowing) are indicative of anxiety. High-level negative affect responses (e.g., worry, fear, and irritability) account for most of the shared (nonspecific) or overlapping symptoms of anxiety and depression. In terms of measurement, self-report instruments composed of positive affect and anxious arousal components are expected to have low to moderate negative correlations (i.e., rs typically range from À.35 to À.50; Cohen, 1988) among the derived scale scores (Keogh & Reidy, 2000). Furthermore, scores on self-report instruments composed of predominantly negative affect components are expected to be associated substantially (rs 5 .45 to .75) with scores on instruments designed to assess a range of mixed depression and anxiety responses, asDownload Free PDFView PDFA convenient method of obtaining percentile norms and accompanying interval estimates for self���report mood scales (DASS, DASS���21, HADS, PANAS, and sAD)2009 • Priyanka sinhaDownload Free PDFView PDFRevista Latino-Americana de EnfermagemConfirmatory factor analysis of the portuguese Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-212012 • Cynthia ArfkenTo determine which of three published models best characterizes the factor structure of the Portuguese version of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 and to assess its validity and reliability. Confirmatory factor analysis of Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 for 1,297 adult, primary care outpatients (66.7% female, Mage = 48.57 years) comparing 3 models. The relationship between the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule was analyzed. The correlated 3-factor model fit the data best. The scale demonstrated good internal consistency, with alpha scores of the subscales ranging from 0.836 to 0.897. Correlation with the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule was positive and moderate with the negative affect scale; it was negative and limited with the positive affect. These findings support the correlated 3-factor structure. The test demonstrated adequate reliability and construct validity, which supports its use for screening in primary...Download Free PDFView PDFTurkish Version of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS- 42):Psychometric PropertiesNazan BilgelDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
