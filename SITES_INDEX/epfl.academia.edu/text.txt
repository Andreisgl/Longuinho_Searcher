This evolution leads to a drastic reduction of component size and the miniaturization requires very high precision for manufacturing, assembly and packaging operations. This chapter presents several concepts of high precision robots that meet the permanent issue of product miniaturization. The works that will be presented directly connect to fields of interest to the IFToMM and also demonstrate how they can generate attractive opportunities for Swiss companies.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

However, the added-value of such devices is significantly impacted by their limited energetic autonomy, excessive weight and cost, thus preventing their full appropriation by the users. There is thus a strong incentive to produce active yet affordable, lightweight and energy efficient devices. To address these issues, we developed the ELSA (Efficient Lockable Spring Ankle) prosthesis embedding both a lockable parallel spring and a series elastic actuator, tailored to the walking dynamics of a sound ankle. The first contribution of this paper concerns the developement of a bio-inspired, lightweight and stiffness-adjustable parallel spring, comprising an energy efficient ratchet and pawl mechanism with servo actuation. The second contribution is the addition of ...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This robot is a 3 d.o.f. parallel robot based on a Delta-like kinematics [Clavel 88, 92]. It is actually an inverted Delta in which the parallel bars are inverted towards the basis. There are two principal advantages of this structure. The first is that there is less links between the actuators and the support basis. The second concerns the fact that end- effector naturally moves without changing the direction of the motors. This last characteristic leads to a fastest structure. This paper is organized as follows: At first, we will present the previous version of the micro-delta [Rey 94] and the actuator trajectories when carrying out a typical pick and place operations. The second part concerns the proposition of this new kinematics (called inverted delta), its optimization, simulation, design and the mechanics. A comparison between the actuator’s trajectories will be show...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

According to the invention, the output shafts (21) of the servo motors (16) are coupled directly, that is without the use of gearboxes connected to the servo motors (16), to the respective two arms (31, 32) via the transmission elements (24), and mechanical vibration damping elements (100; 100a to 100f) for damping vibrations generated by the servo motors (16) are arranged in the region of the transmission elements (24) and/or of the arms (31, 32) and/or of the carrier element.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
