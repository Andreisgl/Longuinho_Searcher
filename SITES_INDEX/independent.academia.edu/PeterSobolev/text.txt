Recently interpretation of existing offshore well logs for the Russian Barents Sea was performed and generalized porosity-depth trends were compiled (Sobolev, 2012). The results of porosity-depth analysis were supplemented with sonic log interpretation and vitrinite reflectance data to provide assessment of the total Mesozoic-Cenozoic exhumation magnitude. In this study we extended the latter approach to interpolate the results from wells using seismic velocity data from common-depth point seismic reflection surveys. The previous point assessments of the regional Cenozoic exhumation magnitude were significantly improved. Differential exhumation throughout the province has occurred. The least uplift and erosion (400-500 m) occur in the depocenters of both South and North Barents Sea Basins. The combined fission-track and U/Pb dating of apatite by LA-ICP-MS was used for reconstruction of the thermal history. The apatite from all 13 samples (Fersmanovskaya-1 well) was dated is partially annealed. The tentative interpretation of fission-track data shows that the Lower Triassic – Lower Jurassic rocks, apparently, used to be within the partial annealing zone in Middle Jurassic - Cretaceous, and an acceleration of exhumation occurred in Early Paleogene (~60 Ma).Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Organic petrological and geochemical analyses (vitrinite reflectance measurements, Rock-Eval pyrolysis, GC-MS) were undertaken in order to screen the maturity, quality and quantity of the organic matter in the outcrop samples. The lithology varies from continental sedimentary rocks with coal particles to shallow marine carbonates and deep marine black shales. Several organic-rich intervals were identified in the Upper Paleozoic to Lower Cenozoic succession. Lower Devonian shales were found to have the highest source rock potential of all Paleozoic units. Middle Carboniferous-Permian and Triassic units appear to have a good potential for natural gas formation. Late Mesozoic (Cretaceous) and Cenozoic low-rank coals, lignites, and coal-bearing sandstones also display a potential for gas generation. Kerogen type III (humic, gas-prone) dominates in most of the samples, and indicates deposition in lacustrine to coastal paleoenvironments. Most of the samples (except some of Cretaceous and Paleogene age) reached oil window maturities, whereas the Devonian to Carboniferous units shared a maturity mainly within the gas window.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The spherical block-and-fault dynamics (BAFD) model consists of fifteens blocks approximating tectonic plates and several additional blocks representing parts of the plates, where deep seismicity is observed. The blocks move as a consequence of the prescribed underlying mantle motion. The block displacements at any time are defined so that the system of the blocks is in a quasi-static equilibrium state. Because of the block rigidity, all deformations take place in the fault zones. The interaction between the spherical blocks is visco-elastic (a state of stress accumulation), so long as the ratio of the stress to the pressure is below a certain strength level. When this level is exceeded in some part of a fault, a stress-drop (a synthetic earthquake) occurs in accordance with the dry friction law. Immediately following the earthquake and for some period of time, the corresponding parts of the faults are in a state of creep. Catalogs of synthetic earthquakes are produced as results of numerical simulations. Using the catalogs of synthetic events we study frequency-magnitude relationships, clustering of the events, long-range interaction of earthquakes, earthquake mechanisms, and fault slips. The model catalogs obtained reflect important features of global seismicity: (i) two large seismic belts, the circum-Pacific and Alpine-Himalayan; (ii) extensive, but less pronounced, seismicity at mid-oceanic ridges; and (iii) increased seismic activity associated with triple junctions of plate boundaries. The model results are consistent with the observations: Nazca/South America, Cocos/Caribbean, India/Eurasia, California region, Arabia/Eurasia, northern Australia, and the Philippine plate margin are marked in the model as the regions prone to strong earthquakes. The modeled seismic activity is moderate at the boundaries such as the southern Pacific plate, Nazca/Pacific, east and southwest of Africa, India/Australia, and North America/ Eurasia.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

We summarized the principal results of the studies in MOR seismicity and their implications for geodynamics. The studies of epicenter distribution along the ridges and of focal mechanisms make an important contribution to the development of plate tectonics. During recent decades, a great amount of information on MOR structure and sea-floor spreading has become available. Geological and geophysical observations revealed a partitioning of the ridge by numerous discontinuities of several orders, which is reflected in the seismicity. There is a clear difference in seismic regime between two kinds of first-order segments—transform faults and spreading centers. The first have seismic moment release one–two orders higher; their contribution into the total seismic budget of MOR increases with higher spreading rate. The relationships between the seismic moment release, fault length and spreading rate are quite different for transform and rift parts of MOR; this confirms the difference in the geometry of their respective earthquake source volumes. In both these cases, the principal factor controlling the ridge seismicity is the thermal structure of the lithosphere. Microseismic experiments using ocean bottom seismometers, hydrophones and sonobuoys have perceptibly reduced the cutoff magnitude of complete reporting and the location uncertainty. Large numbers of microearthquakes are usually recorded almost everywhere near the ridge axis, even during relatively short recording times. More detailed location of epicenters and focal depths acquired great significance in the studies of magmatism, hydrothermal circulation and fracturing on MOR. Some spatial relationships seem to emerge between epicenter distribution and the location of hydrothermal sulfide deposits along the MOR. Several hierarchical levels could be distinguished; the nature of the relationship depends on the level of interest.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Seismicity of oceanic and continental rifts—a geodynamic approachTwo major kinds of divergent structures—oceanic and intracontinental rifts—were compared in princ... more Two major kinds of divergent structures—oceanic and intracontinental rifts—were compared in principal seismic and tectonic characteristics. First, the role of main components of the mid-oceanic ridges (MOR) was estimated for the whole Earth. We considered two levels of the MOR segmentation. The first-order structures are the segments of MOR between triple junctions and the second-order structures are a transform faults and rift parts of MOR. The seismic catalogues NEIC and CMT were used to assess the seismic moment release. The seismic moment release was calculated another way using the global plate tectonic model NUVEL-1 and Brune's formulae. Comparison of these two values shows that the seismic coupling coefficient, α, varies from 1 to 10% for most of MOR and is always higher for transform faults. Most of the deformation, therefore, is aseismic slip. Most seismicity of MOR is confined to transform faults. The energy contribution of transform faults is one to two orders magnitude higher than that of the rift, and increases with the spreading rate. There is a strong correlation between the seismic moment release of strike–slip faults and their total lengths. The correlation shows that the seismic moment release depends on the total transform area and confirms the simple thermal model of transform seismicity that was given by Burr and Solomon. The seismic moment release and the spreading rate have opposite patterns. For the rifts, there is an inverse correlation between the seismic moment of normal faults and spreading velocity, while it seems for transforms that these parameters are independent. Finally, these results show that the seismicity of transforms and rifts depends first of all on the thermal structure of oceanic lithosphere. In the case of continental rifts, one can distinguish in the degree of seismic activity depending on the stage of rifting. Hence, analysis of the continental seismicity requires the consideration of factors of a geological evolution that play practically no role in the case of oceanic lithosphere. The comparison of geological and seismic data for the East African region has allowed us to outline the regular changes of the seismic regime during development of the rift zone from the stage of incipient rift to mature oceanic rift. In the evolutionary series [intracontinental incipient rift]–[intracontinental mature rift]–[intercontinental rift]–[oceanic slow-spreading rift]–[oceanic fast-spreading rift], there is a gradual decrease of the role of rifts (sensu stricto, as tension structures) and increase of the role of strike–slip faults. Epicenters concentrate along major faults as well. The level of seismic energy becomes lower, although the rate of deformation increases.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
