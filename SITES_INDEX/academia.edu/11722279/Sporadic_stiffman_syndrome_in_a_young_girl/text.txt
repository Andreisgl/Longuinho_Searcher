Her clinical features and electromyography suggested Stiffman syndrome, and her response to high-dose diazepam and baclofen confirmed the diagnosis. Stiffman syndrome is a rare entity, rarer still in childhood. This is the youngest case of sporadic Stiffman syndrome reported in literature. Distinguishing Stiffman syndrome from similar conditions such as Schwartz-Jampei syndrome or neuromyotonia is important because administration of GABAergic agents (valproate, baclofen, diazepam) elicits a good response. © 1997 by Elsevier Science Inc.

In this review, we covered situations in which the main manifestations are MDs that pose significant risks for acute morbidity and mortality. The authors examine literature data on the most relevant MD emergencies, including those related to Parkinson&#39;s disease, acute drug reactions (acute dystonia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, serotonergic syndrome and malignant hyperthermia), acute exacerbation of chronic MD (status dystonicus), hemiballism and stiff-person syndrome, highlighting clinical presentation, demographics, diagnosis and management.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
