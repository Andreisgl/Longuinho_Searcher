Para avaliar a integridade ecológica de riachos na região de Cerrado do Brasil Central foram selecionados quatro pontos de coleta, considerando o nível de influência antrópica ao qual estão submetidos. Foram analisados parâmetros físicos e químicos da água, o uso da paisagem e a comunidade de macroinvetebrados bentônicos. As coletas foram realizadas em julho de 2015 e foram mensuradas " in situ " as variáveis condutividade elétrica, temperatura da água, pH, oxigênio dissolvido, turbidez, largura e comprimento do riacho e velocidade da correnteza. Em seguida, foram coletadas amostras para o seston, perifíton, macroinvertebrados bentônicos e sedimento depositado. O ponto " Referência " apresentou menor abundância de larvas de Chironomus (Chironomidae: Diptera) e maior riqueza taxonômica, além de maior abundância dos grupos taxonômicos Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera e Trichoptera, mostrando ser o sistema mais íntegro dentre os analisados. A sub-bacia delimitada a partir desse ponto mostrou uma maior porcentagem de áreas com vegetação nativa (51%). Os pontos com presença de efluentes domésticos (" ETE " e " Jusante ") por sua vez, apresentaram valores mais elevados de condutividade elétrica, turbidez, maior abundância de larvas de Chironomus e menor riqueza de táxons, mostrando elevado impacto em função das atividades antrópicas. A avaliação rápida realizada com a composição da comunidade bentônica e as variáveis físicas e químicas da água foi suficiente na identificação das alterações na integridade ecológica causadas pela influência antrópica na bacia hidrográfica do rio Corumbá.

This hinders cross-continental comparisons and causes confusion as words, such as &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#x27;forest&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#x27;and &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#x27;savanna&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#x27;have different meanings to different people.
