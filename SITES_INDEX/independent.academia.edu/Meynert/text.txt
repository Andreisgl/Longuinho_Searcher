The first part attempts to define concepts like " women " , " sex " , " gender " , " feminism " and " patriarchy ". It then attempt to trace the historical evolution and contents of different types of feminisms, namely, Liberal feminism, Marxist feminism, Radical feminism, Socialist feminism, Post-modern feminism and the feminist discourses in India. The second part explores the distinction between " The Women-in-Development " (WID) approach and the Gender-Relations approach to Poverty. The paper then explores how health care can be feminised; what poverty alleviation from a gender perspective would entail; how population issues can be feminised; and the strategies for empowering women. Finally it eclecticizes the insights found in different schools of feminisms to make a unified statement about feminist theory that can be vital to development and health planning for women. A feminist perspective in population policy has to break beyond the narrow fertility reduction goals and help to work towards empowerment of women. The concept of responsible father-hood and husband-hood needs to be promoted in order to sensitise men into supporting women in their productive and reproductive roles. Questions like: Is it relevant at this forum to raise the question about what can be done about the asymmetrical alignment of the North and South in the World order and distribution of world resources, a symmetries in relation to power and resources within a nation? How can this dimension be worked into the Gender and Health concerns needs to be asked?Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
