Phabricator is an open-source software development platform.
It is used for tracking issues and project management of Wikimedia and related software.
Go to Wikimedia Phabricator
Get started
Phabricator is for software bug reports, feature requests, and planning work.
To ask technical questions about Wikimedia projects, see m:Tech

Creating your account
Creating a task
If you maintain projects: Creating a project and learning about project management in Phabricator.
Etiquette
Learn to use Phabricator. Play and test in our Cloud Services instance as much as you want (the test instance is unfortunately not always online). Check out the documentation and short videos on Phabricator/Help .
Weekly update / maintenance window
Phabricator doesn't have releases, and therefore it is up to us to decide how close do we want to follow the upstream version.
There is a weekly window for updates and other maintenance tasks on Wednesdays at 5:00PM Pacific (Thursday Midnight, 0:00 UTC) (check your timezone) and users will get redirected to Phabricator/Maintenance.
We don't necessarily update Phabricator every week, but we reserve this window to use as needed, usually twice per month, depending on the urgency of outstanding bugs fixed upstream.
The expected downtime during this window is between 0 and 30 minutes.
For specific bugs and changes, query for resolved tasks of the latest update date under "Milestones" and check the corresponding latest upstream Changelog items.
