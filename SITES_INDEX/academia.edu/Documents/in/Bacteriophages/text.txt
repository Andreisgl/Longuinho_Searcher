They can be divided into various groups according to their life cycle. The lytic phages kill their host cells and this property can be applied for selective elimination of pathogenic bacteria. The first bacteriophage treatment was described one hundred years ago, and phage therapy had been extensively used till the Second World War. Upon appearance of antibiotics, the medical application of phages retrograded in most parts of the world. In the last decades, owing to the costs of development of new antibiotics and rapid emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria, this old approach was revitalized and phage-based treatment was legalized from the middle of the last decade. Here, we summarize the current knowledge on phage therapy, its advantages and potential drawbacks. The application of phages against plant pathogens, especially Erwinia amylovora is discussed.

In this study, we examined the previously isolated and partially characterized B. bronchiseptica siphoviruses of the genus Vojvodinavirus (LK3, CN1, CN2, FP1 and MW2) for their ability to inhibit bacterial growth and biofilm, and we examined other therapeutically important properties through genomic analysis and lysogeny experiments. The phages inhibited bacterial growth at a low multiplicity of infection (MOI = 0.001) of up to 85% and at MOI = 1 for &gt;99%. Similarly, depending on the phages and MOIs, biofilm formation inhibition ranged from 65 to 95%. The removal of biofilm by the phages was less efficient but still considerably high (40–75%).

In this work we isolated and assembled a five member cocktail of wild phages against A. baumannii and demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in a mouse full-thickness dorsal infected wound model. The cocktail lowers the bioburden in the wound, prevents the spread of infection and necrosis to surrounding tissue, and decreases infection-associated morbidity. Interestingly, this effective cocktail is composed of four phages that do not kill the parent strain of the infection, and one phage that simply delays bacterial growth in vitro via a strong but incomplete selection event. The cocktail here appears to function in a combinatorial manner, as one constituent phage targets capsulated A. baumannii and selects for loss of receptor, shifting the population to an uncapsulated state that is then sensitized to the remaining four phages in t...Save to LibraryDownloadby Meron Ghebremedhin•  19  Microbiology, Medical Microbiology, Biology, BacteriophagesRapid Detection of Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Methicillin-Susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) Using the KeyPath MRSA/MSSA Blood Culture Test and the BacT/ALERT System in a Pediatric PopulationContext.—Timely initiation of directed antimicrobial therapy for Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia is dependent on rapid identification of S aureus to ascertain methicillin-susceptibility status.

While the evolution of different virulence levels is well studied, the evolution of host resistance in response to different virulence levels is less understood and as of now mainly based on observations and theoretical predictions with few experimental tests. Increased virulence can increase selection for host resistance evolution if resistance costs are outweighed by the benefits of avoiding infection. To test this, we experimentally evolved the bacterium Vibrio alginolyticus in the presence of two variants of the filamentous phage, VALGΦ8, that differ in their virulence. The bacterial host exhibited two alternative defence strategies against future phage infection: (1) super infection exclusion (SIE) whereby phage-infected cells were immune to subsequent infection at a cost of reduced growth, and (2) surface receptor mutations (SRM) in genes encoding the MSHA type-IV...Save to LibraryDownloadby Heiko Liesegang•  8  Microbiology, Biology, Virology, Biological Sciencesα,β-Difluoromethylene Deoxynucleoside 5′-Triphosphates: A Convenient Synthesis of Useful Probes for DNA Polymerase β Structure and FunctionSave to LibraryDownloadby Samuel Wilson•  12  Chemistry, Medicine, Protein Structure and Function, Pyruvate KinaseTopical treatment of Klebsiella pneumoniae B5055 induced burn wound infection in mice using natural productsBackground: Burn wound infection remains the principal cause of death in burn patients.

Even though randomization generates comparable treatment and control groups, the remaining survivors often differ significantly in background variables that are prognostic to the outcomes. This is called the truncation by death problem. Under the potential outcomes framework, the only well-defined causal effect on the outcome is within the subgroup of patients who would always survive under both treatment and control. Because the definition of the subgroup depends on the potential values of the survival status that could not be observed jointly, without making strong parametric assumptions, we cannot identify the causal effect of interest and consequently can only obtain bounds of it. Unfortunately, however, many bounds are too wide to be useful.

An inclusive Research Education Community (iREC) provides a centralized scientific and administrative infrastructure enabling engagement of large numbers of students at different types of institutions. The Science Education Alliance-Phage Hunters Advancing Genomics and Evolutionary Science (SEA-PHAGES) is an iREC that promotes engagement and continued involvement in science among beginning undergraduate students. The SEA-PHAGES students show strong gains correlated with persistence relative to those in traditional laboratory courses regardless of academic, ethnic, gender, and socioeconomic profiles. This persistent involvement in science is reflected in key measures, including project ownership, scientific community values, science identity, and scientific networking.Save to LibraryDownloadby Stephanie Stockwell•  20  Program Evaluation, Psychology, Education, Science EducationThe Mobilome; A Major Contributor to Escherichia coli stx2-Positive O26:H11 Strains Intra-Serotype DiversitySave to LibraryDownloadby P.

These ubiquitous proteins are present in prokaryotes, eukaryotes, and viruses, and play a pivotal role in the following major cellular processes: replication, recombination, and repair of genetic material. In DNA replication, SSB proteins specifically stimulate DNA polymerase, increase fidelity of DNA synthesis, assist the advance of DNA polymerase, and organize and stabilize replication forks. Here, we present our characterization of four SSB proteins of different origins. One of them was isolated from Clostridium sp. phage phiCP130 (SSB C1: 124 aa, Mr = 13,905).

Many of these heat-stable proteins are useful for biotechnological applications; nevertheless, none have been utilized as antibacterial agents.

While mesophilic phages have been extensively studied, their thermophilic counterparts are not well characterized. Here, we present a detailed analysis of the structure and function of Ts2631 endolysin from thermophilic phage vB_Tsc2631, which is a zinc-dependent amidase. The active site of Ts2631 consists of His30, Tyr58, His131 and Cys139, which are involved in Zn2+ coordination and catalysis. We found that the active site residues are necessary for lysis yet not crucial for peptidoglycan binding. To elucidate residues involved in the enzyme interaction with peptidoglycan, we tested single-residue substitution variants and identified Tyr60 and Lys70 as essential residues. Moreover, substitution of Cys80, abrogating disulfide bridge formation, inactivates Ts2631, as do substitutions of His31, Thr32 and Asn85 residues.

We generated and characterized two single-copy Tn916ΔE mutants which were resistant to phage A118 and several other serotype 1/2a-specific phages. In one mutant the insertion was immediately upstream of the recently identifiedptsHI locus, which encodes two proteins of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent carbohydrate uptake system, whereas in the other the insertion was immediately upstream of an operon whose most distal gene was clpC, involved in stress responses and virulence. Transduction experiments confirmed the association of the phage-resistant phenotype of these mutants with the transposon insertion.

As antibiotics are counter-indicated for treatment of these infections, they represent prime candidates for targeted application of bacteriophages to reduce infection burden. In this study, we characterised lytic bacteriophages representing three phage genera for activity against E. coli O157 strains. The phages vb_EcoM_bov9_1 (Tequatrovirus), vb_EcoM_bov11CS3 (Vequintavirus), and vb_EcoS_bov25_1D (Dhillonvirus) showed effective lysis of enterohaemorrhagic E. coli EHEC O157:H7 strains, while also exhibiting activity against other strains of the O157 serogroup, as well as of the ‘big six’ (STEC) serogroups, albeit with lower efficiency.

Atypical El Tor strains are categorized into 2 groups, Wave 2 and Wave 3 strains, based on genomic variations and the CTX phage that they harbor. Whole-genome analysis of V. cholerae strains in the seventh cholera pandemic has demonstrated gradual changes in the genome of prototype and atypical El Tor strains, indicating that atypical strains arose from the prototype strains by replacing the CTX phages.

Two adult patients with Cystic Fibrosis colonized by Achromobacter xylosoxidans CF418 or Achromobacter ruhlandii CF116 experienced fatal exacerbations. Achromobacter spp. are naturally resistant to several antibiotics. Therefore, phages could be valuable as therapeutics for the control of Achromobacter. In this study, thirteen lytic phages were isolated and characterized at the morphological and genomic levels for potential future use in phage therapy. They are presented here as the Achromobacter Kumeyaay phage collection. Six distinct Achromobacter phage genome clusters were identified based on a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of the Kumeyaay collection as well as the publicly available Achromobacter phages.

Limited genomic information shows that phage genomes are mosaic, and the genetic architecture of phage populations remains ill-defined.

Their genetic diversity is considerable, and there are 28 distinct genomic types (clusters) with related nucleotide sequences. However, amino acid sequence comparisons show pervasive genomic mosaicism, and quantification of inter-cluster and intra-cluster relatedness reveals a continuum of genetic diversity, albeit with uneven representation of different phages.

The double-stranded DNA genome of AAS23 (51,170 bp) contains 92 probable protein encoding genes, and no genes for tRNA. A comparative sequence analysis revealed that 25 of all AAS23 open reading frames (ORFs) code for unique proteins that have no reliable identity to database entries. Based on the phylogenetic analysis, AAS23 has no close relationship to other viruses publicly available to date and represents a single species of the genus Sauletekiovirus within the family Drexlerviridae. The phage is able to form plaques in bacterial lawns even at 4 °C and demonstrates a depolymerase activity. Thus, the data presented in this study not only provides the information on Pantoea-infecting bacteriophages, but also offers novel insights into the diversity of cold-adapted viruses and their potential to be used as biocontrol agents.Save to LibraryDownloadby Algirdas Kaupinis•  6  Biology, Medicine, Genome, MicroorganismsPantoea agglomerans-Infecting Bacteriophage vB_PagS_AAS21: A Cold-Adapted Virus Representing a Novel Genus within the Family SiphoviridaeA novel cold-adapted siphovirus, vB_PagS_AAS21 (AAS21), was isolated in Lithuania using Pantoea agglomerans as the host for phage propagation.

AAS21 has an isometric head (~85 nm in diameter) and a non-contractile flexible tail (~174 × 10 nm). With a genome size of 116,649 bp, bacteriophage AAS21 is the largest Pantoea-infecting siphovirus sequenced to date. The genome of AAS21 has a G+C content of 39.0% and contains 213 putative protein-encoding genes and 29 genes for tRNAs.

TEM observations revealed that those protein nanotubes varied in length (~10–1000 nm). Meanwhile, the width of the polysheaths (~28 nm) corresponded to the width of the contracted tail sheath of phage FV3. The formed protein nanotubes could withstand various extreme treatments including heating up to 100 °C and high concentrations of urea. To determine the shortest variant of gp053 capable of forming protein nanotubes, a set of N- or/and C-truncated as well as poly-His-tagged variants of gp053 were constructed. The TEM analysis of these mutants showed that up to 25 and 100 amino acid residues could be removed from the N and C termini, respectively, without disturbing the process of self-assembly. In addition, two to six copies of the gp053...Save to LibraryDownloadby Algirdas Kaupinis•  3  Chemistry, Medicine, VirusesMolecular Analysis of Arthrobacter Myovirus vB_ArtM-ArV1: We Blame It on the TailThis is the first report on a myophage that infects Arthrobacter .

A novel virus, vB_ArtM-ArV1 (ArV1), was isolated from soil using Arthrobacter sp. strain 68b for phage propagation. Transmission electron microscopy showed its resemblance to members of the family Myoviridae : ArV1 has an isometric head (∼74 nm in diameter) and a contractile, nonflexible tail (∼192 nm). Phylogenetic and comparative sequence analyses, however, revealed that ArV1 has more genes in common with phages from the family Siphoviridae than it does with any myovirus characterized to date. The genome of ArV1 is a linear, circularly permuted, double-stranded DNA molecule (71,200 bp) with a GC content of 61.6%. The genome includes 101 open reading frames (ORFs) yet contains no tRNA genes. More than 50% of ArV1 genes encode unique proteins that either have no reliable identity to database entries or have homologues only in Arthrobacter phages, both sipho- and myoviruses.

Due to increasing levels of global antibiotic resistance exhibited by many pathogenic organisms, alternative strategies to combat such infections are urgently required. In this study, we evaluated the stability of five coliphages (four Myoviridae and one Siphoviridae phage) over a range of pH conditions and in simulated gastric conditions. The Myoviridae phages were stable across the range of pH 2 to 7, while the Siphoviridae phage, JK16, exhibited higher sensitivity to low pH. A composite mixture of these five phages was tested in vivo in a Galleria mellonella model. The obtained data clearly shows potential in treating E. coli infections prophylactically.Save to LibraryDownloadby Gabriele Andrea Lugli•  9  Microbiology, Biology, Medicine, Escherichia coliProbiogenomics Analysis of 97 Lactobacillus crispatus Strains as a Tool for the Identification of Promising Next-Generation ProbioticsMembers of the genus Lactobacillus represent the most common colonizers of the human vagina and are well-known for preserving vaginal health and contrasting the colonization of opportunistic pathogens.

Remarkably, high abundance of Lactobacillus crispatus in the vaginal environment has been linked to vaginal health, leading to the widespread use of many L. crispatus strains as probiotics. Nevertheless, despite the scientific and industrial relevance of this species, a comprehensive investigation of the genomics of L. crispatus taxon is still missing. For this reason, we have performed a comparative genomics analysis of 97 L. crispatus strains, encompassing 16 strains sequenced in the framework of this study alongside 81 additional publicly available genome sequences. Thus, allowing the dissection of the L.crispatus pan-genome and core-genome followed by a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis based on the predicted core genes that revealed clustering based on ecological origin.

Lactococcal strains are described as typically harboring a number of prophages in their chromosomes. The presence of such prophages may provide both advantages and disadvantages to the carrying host. Here, we describe the deliberate generation of three distinct lysogens of the model lactococcal strain 3107 and the impact of additional prophage carriage on phage-resistance and anti-microbial susceptibility. Lysogen-specific responses were observed, highlighting the unique relationship and impact of each lysogenic phage on its host. Both homologous and heterologous phage-resistance profiles were observed, highlighting the presence of possible prophage-encoded phage-resistance factors. Superinfection exclusion was among the most notable causes of heterologous phage-resistance profiles with resistance observed against members of the Skunavirus, P335, P087, and 949 lactococcal phage groups.

Their early appearance and dominance in the human infant gut and the reported health-promoting or probiotic status of several bifidobacterial strains has culminated in intensive research efforts that focus on their activities as part of the gut microbiota and the concomitant implications for human health. In this mini-review, we evaluate current knowledge on the genomics of this diverse bacterial genus, and on the genetic and functional adaptations that have underpinned the success of bifidobacteria in colonising the infant gut. The growing interest in functional genomics of bifidobacteria has also created interest in the interactions of bifidobacteria and their (bacterio)phages. While virulent phages of bifidobacteria have yet to be isolated, the incidence of integrated (pro)phages in bifidobacterial genomes are widely reported and this mini-review considers the role of these so-called bifi...Save to LibraryDownloadby Gabriele Andrea Lugli•  12  Biology, Bacteriophages, Medicine, MultidisciplinaryPhage Biodiversity in Artisanal Cheese Wheys Reflects the Complexity of the Fermentation ProcessSave to LibraryDownloadby Gabriele Andrea Lugli•  18  Microbiology, Biology, Bacteriophages, BiodiversityGenome Sequence of Serratia marcescens Phage BFPhages infecting Serratia marcescens, a common causative agent of nosocomial infections, have potential therapeutic applications.

The lactococcal P335 phages, which are currently classified into four sub-groups (I-IV), are the second most frequently isolated phage group in an industrial dairy context. The current work describes the isolation and comparative genomic analysis of 17 novel P335 group phages. Detailed analysis of the genomic region of P335 phages encoding the so-called &quot;baseplate&quot;, which includes the receptor binding protein (RBP) was combined with a functional characterization of the RBP of sub-group III and IV phages. Additionally, calcium-dependence assays revealed a specific requirement for calcium by sub-group IV phages while host range analysis highlighted a higher number of strains with CWPS type A (11 of 39 strains) are infected by the P335 phages assessed in this study than those with a C (five strains), B (three of 39 strains) or un...Save to LibraryDownloadby Gabriele Andrea Lugli•  13  Genetics, Genomics, Biology, BacteriophagesCharacterization and genomic analyses of Aeromonas hydrophila phages AhSzq-1 and AhSzw-1, isolates representing new species within the T5virus genusIn this study, two bacteriophage isolates, AhSzq-1 and AhSzw-1 that specifically infect Aeromonas hydrophila strain KT998822, were isolated from seawater and characterized.

One-step growth curves showed that the latent period of AhSzq-1 and AhSzw-1 are 50 min and 60 min, respectively. The sequence similarities between AhSzq-1 and AhSzw-1 were 88% at the DNA and 83% at the protein level, suggesting that these two phages are representatives of two different species. The virion morphology, DNA genome size and terminal repeats of these two phages are similar to those of viruses classified as T5virus phages. Both phylogenetic analyses and proteomic comparison show that AhSzq-1 and AhSzw-1 group with members of the T5virus genus. We thus propose these two phages as representative isolates of two new species within the T5virus genus.Save to LibraryDownloadby deng atak deng•  18  Microbiology, Genomics, Biology, VirologyDevelopment of Nanotechnology-Based Drug Delivery Systems for Controlling Clinical Multidrug-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli Associated with Aerobic VaginitisThe growing prevalence of resistance to antibiotics potentially makes Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus serious pathogens, necessitating the development of new antimicrobial agents.

We extracted crude biosurfactants from a potential probiotic Bacillus spp. to control pathogenic bacteria associated with aerobic vaginal infection. Using nanotechnology formulations, we developed nanoemulsions based on biosurfactants at different concentrations (1% and 3.33%). The results showed that these nanoemulsions were stable, with a weighted index of 0.3, and demonstrated broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, with MICs ranging between 1.25 and 4 mg/mL. Additionally, the nanoemulsions exhibited interesting antibiofilm effects. All strains became more sensitive to the antibiotics to which they were resistant because of various biosurfactant formulations combined with antibiotics. Lower concentrations of BNE1% and 3.33% were still more eff...Save to LibraryDownloadby Najla haddaji•PharmaceuticsIsocratic reporter-exclusion immunoassay using restricted-access adsorbentsSave to LibraryDownloadby ujwal patil•Complementary action of recombination and excision in the repair of ultraviolet irradiation damage to DNASave to LibraryDownloadby Miroslav Radman•  20  Molecular Biology, Biology, Bacteriophages, DNA replicationNextLast »Related TopicsScientific InquiryFollowFollowingVirologyFollowFollowingInfectious DiseasesFollowFollowingDairyFollowFollowingPolitical JournalismFollowFollowingDairy ProductsFollowFollowingFoodborne Bacterial PathogensFollowFollowingMicrobiologyFollowFollowingBiosurfactantsFollowFollowingBacteriophage TherapyFollowFollowing 71.6 million researchers use this site every month.
