Abstract
A promising medium is the One Laptop Per Child (OLPC); when used by the teacher, it is called One Laptop Per Teacher (OLPT). This paper proposes structure and content for in-service training of teachers in the use of OLPC, using the OLPT. With the OLPC pupils build each other up by co-operating and collaborating, using the mesh networking facilities built into the OLPC. And this must also be a key point for teachers, building each other up by co-operating and collaborating using the Web. Wikiversity was used as the repository to keep the current, cooperatively composed, master copy of material prepared by the community for the course for in-service teachers. The in-service teachers are supported by material provided under the LP, and as part of preparing this paper, the authors created a framework for the material that will be provided in the collaborative learning group. The repository has been called "Collaborate and Create In-Service", and this course is at Wikiversity.
