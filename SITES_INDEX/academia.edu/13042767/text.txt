In addition to the attempts to explain the formation of these kinds of practices in the cities and discuss the path-dependent character of CI policies, the challenging task is to identify the main alternatives and inherent logic of CI policies, especially due to the existing rich and diverse experiences of European cities. This article aims to build a typology of the policy practices relating to CI. We make use of an "ideal types" approach, which focuses on determining a limited number of parameters to characterize alternative CI policies in different (European) cities; this is based on how one kind of CI policy practice can be distinguished from another. The article examines how the CI policies in four post-socialist cities (three of which are located in the Baltic...See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated Papersin Phil Jones & Saskia Warren (eds), Creative Economies, Creative Communities: Rethinking Place, Policy And Practice, Ashgate.Cross Intermediation? Policy, Creative Industries and Cultures Across the EU Paul Longhttp://www.ashgate.com/isbn/9781472451378 Edited by Saskia Warren, University of Manchester, UK and Phil Jones, University of Birmingham, UKInvestigating how people and places are connected into the creative economy, this volume takes a holistic view of the intersections between community, policy and practice and how they are co-constituted. The role of the creative economy and broader cultural policy within community development is problematised and, in a significant addition to work in this area, the concept of ‘place’ forms a key cross cutting theme. It brings together case studies from the European Union across urban, rural and coastal areas, along with examples from the developing world, to explore tensions in universal and regionally-specific issues. Empirically-based and theoretically-informed, this collection is of particular interest to academics, postgraduates, policy makers and practitioners within geography, urban and regional studies, cultural policy and the cultural/creative industries.Contents: Introduction, Saskia Warren and Phil Jones.

Index.About the Editor: Saskia Warren is Lecturer at the University of Manchester, UK and Phil Jones is Senior Lecturer at the University of Birmingham, UK.Reviews: ‘A book which usefully re-orientates the study of creative economy to questions of community and place, and helps us to understand how “policy from below” is capable of reshaping these developments towards saner and more just outcomes.’ Kate Oakley, University of Leeds, UK ‘Creative industries and the creative economy have rapidly established themselves within dominant discourses in terms of how we value and explain the role of culture and creativity in contemporary society. If this sudden emergence as “fast policy” wrong-footed many working in the fields of cultural economy, this new book by Warren and Jones shows how we can come to terms with the challenge. It takes us into the everyday reality of making, connecting, celebrating and earning a living that has long marked the complex value of culture, and helps point us behind the narrow confines of a relentlessly instrumental present.’ Justin O'Connor, Monash University, AustraliaDownload Free PDFView PDFManaging urban and regional development through European Capital of Culture programme and creative industriesIgor Mavrin, Maja Lamza-maronicEuropean Capital of Culture is a thriving cultural programme of the European Union, with benefits for the cultural life of cities and regions and also for the economic development of some of the titleholders. Development of cultural and creative sector – cultural and creative industries – is an integral part of the economic development of cities who decide to run for the European Capital of Culture title. (Cultural) tourism and the overall economy of the region are also developed directly through the project. In 2020, for the first time in history of the project, one city from the Republic of Croatia will hold the European Capital of Culture title. This is a great opportunity for Osijek as a regional center – there is a possibility of redefining and reprogramming city development strategies and the possibility of a new positioning within the European Union. The paper provides an overview of the connections of the European Capital of Culture and urban and regional development through the growth of the cultural and creative sector, and also brings a draft of a successful development strategy for Osijek and the region in the context of this programme. The purpose of the survey is to identify trends in the development of the creative sector within the European Capital of Culture, and the attempt to forecast what would be the positive effects of the programme on Osijek. It provides an overview of the possible directions of development in the city's independent candidacy, regional and macro-regional candidacy (Osijek - Eastern Croatian – Pannonian candidacy).Download Free PDFView PDFIdentity Politics in the European Capital of Culture Initiative.

It elaborates on a new concept, cross-innovation, referring to co-innovation and convergence processes taking place between different sectors of digital service economies. The proposition is that digitisation and mediatisation processes are conditioning new inter-sector dialogues and the emergence of new cross-innovation systems at the borderlines of formerly distinct industries. The case study industries presented are, on the one hand, audiovisual media (film, television, videogames, etc.) and health care, education or tourism, on the other hand. The book builds on 2 years of empirical work across Nordic and Baltic countries, putting a special emphasis on the opportunities and challenges for small countries as they build the cross-innovation systems in the era of media globalisation and platformisation of services. The empirical research of 144 interviews with stakeholders (policy makers, entrepreneurs, managers, professionals) from all four sectors and of secondary data and documentary analysis. The findings tell of complex stories how global platformisation of tourism undermines the emergence of related cross-innovation systems in small countries; how fragmentation of local education and health care markets does not enable the scalability of innovations, but protects local innovation systems for being overtaken by global platform giants. The book has stories of successful facilitation of cross-innovation as well as failures to do so.Download Free PDFView PDFCreative Tourism in Cape Town: An Innovation PerspectiveIrma BooyensDownload Free PDFView PDFBaltic Screen Media RviewTallinn Film Cluster: Realities, Expectations and Alternatives2013 • Indrek Ibrus, Silja Lassur, Külliki Tafel-ViiaThe article takes a close look at the entrepreneurial practices of the Estonian film industry and at how these particular practices may be understood to influence the evolution of the film production cluster in Tallinn. It asks how these processes of institutional evolution of the local film industry may be understood to influence the specific nature of audiovisual culture in contemporary Estonia. The article is based on a study that was conducted in mid 2012. The study consisted of interviews with the repre- sentatives of the local film industry, including respondents from production companies (“studios”), post-production companies and distributors. The second phase of the study was a confirmative roundtable with the select group that included the previously interviewed filmmakers and a few additional industry insiders. The key research ques- tions were: (1) what are the existing co-operation practices between companies like and (2) considering the further evolution of the industry cluster in Tallinn, what are the companies’ specific expectations and needs. The current status of the cluster’s competitiveness was evaluated by using Michael Porter’s model for analyzing conditions of competition (Porter’s diamond). Also, development perspectives of the cluster were evaluated, considering the needs and expectations of entrepreneurs. Key results of the research were divided into two basic categories: (1) current state of clustering of AV enterprises and (2) perspectives and alternatives of further development of the AV cluster.Download Free PDFView PDFThe construction of cultural leadershipJon PriceCultural leadership became a key concept in cultural policy and training in the UK during the early 2000s. It attracted significant public and private investment and remains a major focus for development programmes, now internationally, despite significant changes in sectoral needs and context. This paper reviews the evolution of cultural leadership as a discursive construct, drawing on a decade’s research. It pays attention to key inclusions and exclusions, employing Arendt’s theory of action to critique fundamental assumptions. A tendency to privilege organisational leadership is challenged by considering the social and aesthetic dimensions of cultural practice alongside corresponding influences from other spheres of action which complicate the notion of autonomy in cultural production. To define cultural leadership is therefore to engage with culture’s place in civil society. Distinctions between entrepreneurial, generous and public dimensions of cultural leadership are identified in the analysis with implications for practitioners, training providers and policy makers.Download Free PDFView PDFEuropean Capitals of Culture: Success Strategies and Long-Term EffectsBeatriz GarciaThe European City/Capital of Culture Programme was launched in 1985 and the ECoC title has been awarded to nearly 60 cities in 30 countries. The Programme has become a key platform for city positioning and a catalyst for economic and cultural regeneration. Immediate cultural, social and economic impacts are common and the capacity to secure long-term effects, though harder to evidence, has grown in key areas such as urban image change and tourism development. The latter is evidence of the stronger commitment towards sustainable legacy planning and ever more defined and locally sensitive vision statements. This report documents common approaches and success strategies, highlights the strongest claims of long-term effect and analyses recurrent challenges that limit the Programme’s ability to reach its full potential. Key recommendations are the establishment of a standardised evaluation framework, greater emphasis on comparative research and the creation of a formal knowledge transfer programme so that future hosts can better benefit from the wealth of experience developed in the last three decades.Download Free PDFView PDFEuropean Capitals of Culture: Success strategies and long-term effects, published by the European Parliament.
