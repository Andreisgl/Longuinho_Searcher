MediaWiki
Monitoring and understanding all the technical activity happening across the Wikimedia movement is a difficult and time-consuming task.
By subscribing to Tech News, you can help monitor recent software changes likely to impact Wikimedians, and receive a weekly summary on your talk page, without technical jargon.

Subscribe on wiki
Subscribe to talk-page delivery to receive the weekly Tech News on your talk page on your local wiki.
Subscribe to a web feed
Subscribe to an Atom or RSS feed to receive Tech News in your favourite news aggregator as soon as it arrives.
Subscribe to the list
You're also encouraged to subscribe to our mailing list.
The list is low-traffic and allows you to comment on changes and ask for further information. It's also a good place to publish comments and questions from your fellow editors on your wiki.
Read the latest issue
A new issue is published every week.
Read old issues
The archives contain all the previous weekly issues.
Advertise Tech News
Do you know people who would be interested in the Tech News summary? Invite them to sign up for talk-page delivery and the mailing list.
If you get consensus, you can also add a community page (like your local village pump, technical noticeboard or community newspaper) to the talk page delivery list, so that everyone reading the page can see the updates.
You can also display these user boxes on your user page, and copy them to your home wiki:
{{User tech news}}
TNThis user reads Tech News to be notified of upcoming technical changes.
{{User tech news translator}}
This user translates the weekly tech newsletter.
Help write Tech News
Write and simplify
Do add material to Tech News! Any additions are always very welcome.
Add information, even if you are not sure it's vital or important. It is better to remove something later than to miss information that should have been included.
Keep in mind while editing:
Use simple, non-technical language;
Use short, common words and the active voice for verbs;
Use <abbr> for abbreviations and acronyms;
Keep entries short (ideally no longer than two short sentences);
Link to details, ideally translatable content on a wiki, with the most important link first
Use  ([[File:Octicons-sync.svg|12px|link=]]) for items that are in most issues of the newsletter (new MediaWiki version, some meetings) and  ([[File:Octicons-tools.svg|15px|link=]]) for advanced items aimed at technical editors.
Monitor changes
Check the following sources of information. Choose those you understand and are comfortable with: if you understand code, you can look at the commits, for example, while summarizing mailing list discussions may be more appropriate for someone who doesn't code:
The #user-notice tag in Phabricator;
Recent wikitech-ambassadors messages;
Recent wikitech-l threads;
Upcoming deployments;
Wikimedia Foundation Tech Blog.
Select information
From those sources, select what you think is relevant:
for Wikimedians without specialized technical knowledge, who may otherwise not learn about technical changes that may affect them;
for people who relay these news to their fellow editors, like village pumps or noticeboards.
Add material to the next summary.
Any contribution is useful, even just adding a link. Other contributors can help write or simplify a longer description later.
There are more ways to add information to Tech News.

The next issue is scheduled for publication on 2023-09-04.
