Forbes fuels the ideas, creates the communities, and ignites the impact. 
Forbes champions success by celebrating those who have made it and those who aspire to make it. 
Known for convening and curating the most influential leaders and entrepreneurs who are driving change, transforming business and making a significant impact on the world, the historic brand reaches global audiences through its trusted journalism, signature live and virtual events, custom marketing programs and global licensed local editions. 
With an international scale of over 140 million, audiences regularly look to Forbes to inform, inspire, and enable them to create wealth for themselves, their businesses, their communities, and the world. Regarded as the frontrunner for leadership and community-building, Forbes’ most recognized franchises include the esteemed 30 Under 30 (which applauds young trailblazers and their entrepreneurial success), 50 Over 50 (dedicated to spotlighting women over the age of 50 who are shattering age and gender norms across every industry), and the Forbes 400 (the definitive list of the richest Americans). 
And now, 105 years since its inaugural issue, Forbes takes another step toward making the world a more prosperous, equitable and inclusive society. 
Where thought leadership meets creativity and innovation meets impact
Spearheaded by Seth Cohen, who brings over 20 years of experiences in business, philanthropy, and community building, the Forbes Impact Lab aims to be a platform where ideas are amplified, communities are created and impact is ignited.
The Forbes Impact Lab will partner with organizations and agencies to create custom initiatives that amplify and accelerate key priorities of corporate and private philanthropy, ESG and NGO initiatives, and public/governmental entities. 
At the heart of every initiative is Impact as a Service, our strategic and communications-based approach that puts the power of impact at the center of the conversation. By working with a cross-organizational team of experts across storytelling, technology, business and philanthropy, the Forbes Impact Lab combines world-class storytelling with an impact-focused strategy. This collaboration, uniquely powered by our 105-year-old brand, allows us to help our partners reach their target audiences in new, innovative ways—while creating sustainable impact. 
Possibilities with the Forbes Impact Lab are endless
