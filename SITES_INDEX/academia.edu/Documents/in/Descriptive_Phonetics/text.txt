Sociolinguistics has a long tradition of exploring both the language use of political minorities and the regional variation of those who considered among the mainstream population, but it often ignores interaction between the two. This work addresses such interaction among Mexican Americans in Benton Harbor, Michigan, a town which is 95% African American, in terms of both their production and their perception of vowels. This population, composed mostly of former migrant workers, is only beginning to form a community, but linguistic patterns similar to Roeder’s (2006) study of an established community of Mexican Americans in Lansing, Michigan, are already emerging. Contrary to Labov’s (1994) claims that groups like Latinos do not participate in regional variation, the vocalic patterns of Mexican Americans in Benton Harbor and Lansing demonstrate accommodation to the Northern Cities Shift (NCS), a regional change found among whites in the Inland North. This work also addresses claims about substrate Spanish effects in the vowel system, showing several of the claims about confusion patterns might be overstated. Finally, it addresses the social situation that is conditioning the developing dialect, addressing racial tensions and patterns of movement that might contribute to these speakers’ partial adoption of the NCS as opposed to other available local norms.Save to LibraryDownloadby Jaclyn L Ocumpaugh•  101  Discourse Analysis, Religion, Social Psychology, Chicano StudiesLa Batalla de Progreso: Ceceo contra SeseoA senior honors thesis for the Department of Spanish and Portuguese which explores historical linguistics, language change, optimality theory, synchrony, diachrony, and the mutual influence between Arabic and Hispano-Romance in the... moreA senior honors thesis for the Department of Spanish and Portuguese which explores historical linguistics, language change, optimality theory, synchrony, diachrony, and the mutual influence between Arabic and Hispano-Romance in the formative period of well over a milennium and a half (79-1781).

We examine the genre and stylistic features of a teenage discourse, such as lexical, semantic, phonetic and graphic characteristics of the rural British English, the Northern English dialect depicted in the language of a male teenager in THE TRUE TALE OF THE MONSTER BILLY DEAN by David Almond. In this novel the thematic component is represented by the following recurrent concepts or frames: EDUCATION, NATURE OF THE "SELF", COMING OF AGE, ADAPTATION TO CHANGE, RELATIONS BETWEEN OPPOSITES (LIFE AND DEATH, PAST AND FUTURE, REALITY AND FICTION). The expressive lexis, for example, metaphors, teenage slang and collo-quialisms, illustrate youth in crisis and the challenges of growing up. The other novel we analyze is CHASING REDBIRD by Sharon Creech; here we examine the discourse features of a female teenager, including the thematic components of Themes such as FAMILY, OVERCOMING DEPRESSION, and TEENAGE ROMANCE. The analysis of the conversations of fictional characters created by British and American authors is used to build generalizations about the characteristics of language and style of teenagers. The stylistic and genre components highlight the colloquial style used to depict the personal life of a male and female teenagers , who confront the evils of society, including corruption, unkindness, and family issues.Save to LibraryDownloadby Boris Penkov•  67  Discourse Analysis, Phonetics, Dialectology, Dialects of EnglishWord-Initial Glottal Stop Insertion, Hiatus Resolution and Linking in British EnglishGlottal stop insertion at word boundaries is usually not included in descriptions of the phonology of Southern Standard British English (BrE), and little is known about the factors that determine it.

This paper investigates the insertion of glottal stops before vowels at word boundaries (e.g. <town is> pronounced as [taUn?Iz]) in the spontaneous and read  speech of 10 speakers of BrE.Results show that glottal stops are inserted in certain contextsin up to 50% of all cases before vowel-initial words at word boundaries. Glottal stop insertion is least frequent after obstruents (11.8%), followed by sonorants (19.0%) and vowels(29.0%). Preceding high vowels and following low vowels alsomake glottal stop insertion more likely. In addition, glottal stopinsertion is slightly more frequent in read than in spontaneousspeech, which suggests that it is a feature of the standard rather than a colloquial feature of BrE.Save to LibraryDownloadby Robert Fuchs•  29  Languages, Languages and Linguistics, Phonology, Speech ProsodyПроисхождение индоевропейских (и индоарийских) придыхательных и их ностратические прототипыThe origins of Indo-European and Indo-Aryan aspirates and their Nuclear Nostratic prototypes (in Russian) [2020]Save to LibraryDownloadby Igor A Tonoyan-Belyayev•  16  Indo-european language reconstruction, Ancient Indo-European Languages, Indo-European Studies, Comparative LinguisticsSign Language Phonetic Annotation meets Phonological CorpusTools: Towards a Sign Language Toolset for Phonetic Notation and Phonological AnalysisThe field of sign language linguistics still misses a unified notation system such as IPA for spoken languages.

Some previous attempts to create written notation systems are either not suited for phonetic analysis, or language-specific and phoneme-based and thus impossible to use in cross-linguistic studies. We describe a more recent attempt to create a purely phonetic notation system, Sign Language Phonetic Annotation (SLPA) by Johnson and Liddell (2010, 2011a, 2011b, 2012). SLPA aims for narrow phonetic notation, is easily learned by humans and machine-readable, utilizes symbols found on a common keyboard, and does not require the user to be familiar with sign languages. However, SLPA is too exhaustive (a single handshape requires 23-34 characters), incorporates some theoretical assumptions (e.g., binary features), and captures as distinctive handshapes that anatomically impossible, redundant, or perceptually nondistinctive. We propose modifications to SLPA that make it easier to use and avoid coding errors, more user-friendly, and more linguistically relevant, both general modifications suitable for manual notation and software-specific modifications. We also discuss how we intend to adapt SLPA into the Phonological CorpusTools software (Hall et al. 2015), a free tool that allows researchers to make fast, replicable analyses of various phonological patterns.Save to LibraryDownloadby Oksana Tkachman and +1Andre Xavier•  5  Sign Languages, Descriptive Phonetics, notation system, Phonological CorpusToolsPlosive voicing acoustics and voice quality in Yerevan ArmenianYerevan Armenian is a variety of Eastern Armenian with a three-way voicing contrast that includes voiced, voiceless unaspirated, and voiceless aspirated stops, but previous work has not converged on a description of how voice quality is... moreYerevan Armenian is a variety of Eastern Armenian with a three-way voicing contrast that includes voiced, voiceless unaspirated, and voiceless aspirated stops, but previous work has not converged on a description of how voice quality is involved in the contrast. We demonstrate how voice quality can be assessed in a two-dimensional acoustic space using a spectral tilt measure in conjunction with a measure of spectral noise. Eight speakers produced a list of words with prevocalic word-initial and postvocalic word-final plosives. The results suggest that Yerevan Armenian has breathy-voiced plosives which are produced with closure voicing and a relatively spread glottis that is maintained into a following vowel. These qualitatively differ from some Indic ones in that they do not have an extended interval of voiced aspiration after the closure. For the voiceless unaspirated plosives, most speakers produced acoustically modal voiceless plosives, although two showed evidence for some glottal constriction and tensing. Many acoustic cues contribute to overall reliable discriminability of the three-way contrast in both initial and final position. Nevertheless, closure voicing intensity and aspiration duration together provide a robust separation of the three categories in both positions. We also find that back vowels are fronted after the breathy-voiced plosives, which supports a historical analysis in which early Armenian voiced stops were also breathy, rather than plain voiced.Save to LibraryDownloadby Scott Seyfarth•  20  Indo-european language reconstruction, Armenian Studies, Phonetics, Indo-European StudiesPHONEMES OF THE IGNACIANO LANGUAGESave to LibraryDownloadby Willis Ott•Descriptive PhoneticsCruselles, Herrero & Jiménez (2017): "Propietats acústiques i percepció de contrastos mínims en les sibilants del valencià".

Whereas the contrast between /z/ and /s/ seems unquestionable, the existence of a contrast between /ʃ/ and /s/ is much more dubious. Our first goal is to determine if, in a sample of hyperarticulate speech (Fonet, Gonzàlvez et al. 2007), /s/ is different from /z/ and /ʃ/ with respect to seven acoustic parameters: duration, harmonicity, spectral peak and four spectral moments: center of gravity, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. The data indicate that /z/ and /s/ display a clear contrast in duration, harmonicity, and skewness; /ʃ/ and /s/ differ in harmonicity, standard deviation, kurtosis, and, especially, in two features typically associated with place of articulation: spectral peak and center of gravity, but to a lesser extent than in other Catalan dialects. The second goal of the paper is to assess if Valencian speakers are able to distinguish between the two pairs of fricatives: /z/-/s/ and /ʃ/-/s/, using stimuli from the center of each consonant. Perception tests reveal that subjects clearly differentiate the two alveolar consonants, but have more difficulty in distinguishing the pair /ʃ/-/s/.  Keywords: acoustic phonetics, perception, consonants, sibilants, fricatives, Valencian Catalan. RESUM: El valencià estàndard presenta tres consonants fricatives sibilants: /s/, /z/ i /ʃ/. Mentre que el contrast entre /z/ i /s/ sembla indiscutible, l’existència d’una oposició real entre /ʃ/ i /s/ és més dubtosa. El primer objectiu d’aquest treball és comprovar si, en un estil de parla hiperarticulat (Fonet, Gonzàlvez et al. 2007), la consonant /s/ és diferent de /z/ i de /ʃ/ tenint en compte set paràmetres acústics: durada, harmonicitat, pic espectral i quatre moments espectrals: centre de gravetat, desviació estàndard, asimetria i curtosi. Les dades revelen que /z/ i /s/ contrasten clarament en durada, harmonicitat i asimetria; /ʃ/ i /s/ contrasten en harmonicitat, desviació estàndard, curtosi i, en particular, es distingeixen per dos trets típicament associats amb el punt d’articulació: pic espectral i centre de gravetat, però en un grau menor al d’altres dialectes catalans. El segon objectiu del treball és comprovar si els parlants són capaços de discriminar les fricatives /z/-/s/ i /ʃ/-/s/ a partir d’estímuls extrets del centre de les consonants. Els tests de percepció realitzats indiquen que els subjectes perceben clarament el contrast entre les dues consonants alveolars, però tenen més dificultats per distingir el parell /ʃ/-/s/.  Paraules clau: fonètica acústica, percepció, consonants, fricatives, sibilants, valencià.Save to LibraryDownloadby Jesús Jiménez•  32  Catalan Studies, Phonology, Catalan Language, PhoneticsThe bilabial trills of Ahamb (Vanuatu): Acoustic and articulatory propertiesAhamb, an endangered and previously undocumented language of Malekula Island in Vanuatu, has two phonemic bilabial trills-a prenasalised voiced /ᵐʙ/ (with a complementary voiceless allophone word-finally) and a plain voiceless /ʙ̥ /.

This paper adds to our knowledge about these rare sounds by describing their acoustic and articulatory properties, including measurements of the nasal and/or oral closure duration and the frequency of vibration. Such data for bilabial trills in other languages are rare, especially for /ʙ̥ /. The analysis is based on audio recordings of citation forms for 11 speakers and examples extracted from connected speech. The results suggest that prenasalisation, rather than voicing is the primary cue for contrast between /ᵐʙ/ and /ʙ̥ /. Besides, in some realisations of Ahamb bilabial trills, trilling appears to fail. Evidence from slow motion video recordings of Ahamb speakers suggests that in some such examples the lips may still oscillate without producing complete closure.Save to LibraryDownloadby Tihomir Rangelov•  11  Phonetics, Oceanic languages, Endangered Languages, Acoustic PhoneticsThe Variable Chapter In the Story of R: An Acoustic Analysis of a Shift In Final and Pre-Consonantal Instances of American/R/Production In Louisburg, North …Save to LibraryDownloadby Jaclyn L Ocumpaugh•  121  Acoustics, Anthropology, Anthropological Linguistics, Synchronic Linguistics (Or Descriptive Linguistics)Notes on the Phonetics, Phonology and Prosody of the Čakavian Dialect of SusakThe paper deals with synchrony and diachrony of phonetics, phonology and prosody of the Čakavian dialect of Susak (Croatia) based on the author's fieldwork in 2018.

The data is compared to previous studies of the Susak dialect. The local dialect exhibits a number of interesting phonological features-e. g. a complex ("Tsakavian") opposition of postalveolars (/č, ž, š/) to dentals/alveolars (/c, z, s/), centralization of short /i/ and /o/ (in connection to vowel quantity opposition), complex allophonic realizations of the diphthong /i̯e/, etc.-which may be interesting from the perspective of wider phonological theory.Save to LibraryDownloadby Mate Kapović•  20  Synchronic Linguistics (Or Descriptive Linguistics), Historical Linguistics, Phonology, PhoneticsSuomalais-ugrilainen tarkekirjoitus (SUT)The Uralic Phonetic Alphabet is the phonological descriptor or transcription for the Finnish language and its dialects and languages related to Finnish.

Dushanbe, the current capital of Tajikistan, was then a small village with a population of only a few hundred and had no cultural heritage comparable to that of Bukhara or Samarkand. Bukharan Tajik, whose phonology is described in this paper, is a variety of Tajik that played a particularly influential role in the phonological standardization of Tajik, which took place for the most part in 1930. For instance, the Scientific Conference of Uzbekistan Tajiks of 1930 resolved that the dialect of Bukhara must be the designated basis of the sound and orthography of literary Tajik (вaroji tajjorī вa kanfiransijaji ilmiji istalinoвod 1930: 2). In August the same year, the Linguistic Conference held in the then newly established Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic also adopted a similar resolution that establishes the ‘language of the Tajiks of Samarkand and Bukhara’ as the reference point in establishing the literary (i.e. standard) pronunciation (Halimov 1974: 126). According to Bergne (2007: 82), ‘the same Linguistic Conference of 22 August 1930 in Stalinabad decided that the phonetic base for the language had better be the dialect of Bukhara’. Thus, the Bukharan Tajik of today is the direct descendant of the variety of Tajik which served as a primary basis of standard Tajik phonological norms; and hence differs little from standard Tajik phonologically and phonetically.Save to Libraryby Shinji Ido•  40  Languages, Synchronic Linguistics (Or Descriptive Linguistics), Languages and Linguistics, Contact LinguisticsSound comparisons: a new online database and resource for research in phonetic diversitySound Comparisons hosts over 90,000 individual word recordings and 50,000 narrow phonetic transcriptions from 600 language varieties from eleven language families around the world.

It identifies the chain shift as constituting of an intermediate stage of the Northern Tajik chain shift and accordingly tentatively concludes that in the Northern Tajik chain shift Early New Persian ā shifted before ō did, shedding light on the process whereby the present-day Tajik vowel system was established. The article is divided into three parts. The first provides an explanation of the variety of Tajik spoken by Jewish inhabitants of Bukhara. The second section explains the relationship between this particular variety and other varieties that have been used by Jews in Central Asia. The third section deals specifically with the vowel system of the variety and the changes that it has undergone since the late 19th century.Save to Libraryby Shinji Ido•  146  Languages, Synchronic Linguistics (Or Descriptive Linguistics), Diachronic Linguistics (Or Historical Linguistics), Jewish StudiesSound comparisons: a new online database and resource for research in phonetic diversitySound Comparisons hosts over 90,000 individual word recordings and 50,000 narrow phonetic transcriptions from 600 language varieties from eleven language families around the world.

Evidence from slow motion video recordings of Ahamb speakers suggests that in some such examples the lips may still oscillate without producing complete...Save to LibraryDownloadby Tihomir Rangelov•  11  Phonetics, Oceanic languages, Endangered Languages, Acoustic Phonetics"Prominence and centralization: a two-way contrast between lexical and epenthetic non-labial high vowels in Alguerese Catalan".

In this study, we compare five acoustic features of this epenthetic segment (i.e., duration, intensity, and the three first formants) with those of lexical /i/ vowels, both stressed and unstressed. The results indicate that the three vowels present differences only with respect to duration, F2 and, to a lesser extent, F3. The second formant values decline progressively from the lexical stressed vowels to the inserted unstressed segments, with lexical unstressed segments at an intermediate point. This gradation mirrors the relative prominence of each vowel. The differences in F2 between lexical stressed and unstressed vowels can be attributed to the shorter duration of the later segments. Lexical unstressed and inserted vowels, however, have an equivalent duration, challenging the idea that inserted vowels are more centralized due to their shorter duration. All in all, the data point to a double contrast: first, between lexical stressed and unstressed segments and, second, between unstressed segments.Save to LibraryDownloadby Maria-Rosa  Lloret and +1Jesús Jiménez•  32  Catalan Studies, Phonology, Catalan Language, PhoneticsThe Navajo Sound System. 2003     Joyce M.
