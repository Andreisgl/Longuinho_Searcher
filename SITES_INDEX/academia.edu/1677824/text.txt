In this lecture, I summarize these findings and evaluate their importance for Indo-European (IE) and general historical linguistics. Not only is the number of cases to be reconstructed for PIE called into question, but the agglutinative or “secondary” cases of the Anatolian and Tocharian languages, long regarded as typologically odd, are shown to be well motivated developments with numerous parallels within IE and elsewhere. The semantic reinterpretation of adverbial markers as case markers, and the grammaticalization of postpositional phrases as univerbated case forms, must have been taking place already in the late stages of the protolanguage. These results allow us to view the notoriously complex PIE case system, with its elaborate system of portmanteau endings marking case, number, and inflectional class, in wider typological perspective, and to better understand its historical evolution in the various IE languages.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersThe Proto-Indo-European case system and its reflexes in a diachronic typological perspective: Evidence for the linguistic prehistory of Eurasia2012 • Leonid KulikovDownload Free PDFView PDFRivista degli studi orientaliProto-Indo-European case system and its reflexes in a diachronic typological perspective: Evidence for the linguistic prehistory of Eurasia2011 • Leonid  KulikovThe present paper outlines a diachronic typology of changes in case systems within the Indo-European linguistic family. This study is written in the genre of identification and definition of problem: I will not attempt to offer an exhaustive treatment of the subject. Rather, I would like to draw attention to the importance of extensive research in this field in a diachronic typological perspective, which, in my opinion, may shed light on reconstruction of the linguistic prehistory of Eurasia. First, I will summarize some well-known facts about the Indo-European case and the variety of reflexes of the Proto-Indo-European case system, outlining the most important tendencies – without entering into a discussion of details of the individual case systems as well as into details of the Proto-Indo-European reconstruction. In the second part of the paper I will make an attempt to explain some of the attested developments of the original case system as resulting from contacts with non-Indo-European languages. This, in turn, will enable us to make some hypotheses about the case systems and, in general, structural types of some non-documented substrate languages which could have triggered these changes.Download Free PDFView PDFThe Proto-Indo-European Case SystemRoland PoothThis paper provides a comparative and internal reconstruction of the Proto-Indo-European case system.Download Free PDFView PDFLinguistic Analysis and Comparative Philology: The Case-Marking System of Proto-Indo-EuropeanRoland PoothThe reader is presented here with a fundamentally new reconstruction of the case-marking system of the Proto-Indo-European language. This article gives an outline of the nominal proto-inflection and includes a general overview of inflectional and derivational morphological strategies of the proto-language. The presented model deviates from the traditional model in that it is typologically different and based on a combinatorial methodology: The established results of Indo-European comparison are evaluated by means of a typology-based linguistic analysis. This article is a fully revised version of a manuscript that was pre-published in the year 2014 on my profile at www.academia.edu. It is part of work in progress on a new comparative grammar of Proto-Indo-European.Download Free PDFView PDFAdam I.

The paper studies both formal parameters (markedness of case forms, interaction between declensional types) and functional features (overlapping of case semantics, semantic roles encoded, semantic specificity of cases) relevant for case competition. On the basis of evidence from languages with well-attested documented history, I outline possible approaches to the study of a tentative hierarchy of parameters that play an important role for the choice of case in the situation of competition and can be used to make plausible suggestions on the outcome of case competition.Download Free PDFView PDFBenjamins Current TopicsProto-Indo-European Syntax and its Development2015 • Nikolaos LavidasDownload Free PDFView PDFA typological overview of Proto-Indo-EuropeanRoland PoothThis article provides a typological overview of the major highlights of Proto-Indo-European grammar and a brief summary of its morphosyntactic type.

The idea of this workshop was to bring together scholars interested in these and related problems and to shine new light on current research into ancient Indo-European syntax. Special attention was paid to the development of the hypothetical reconstructed features within the documented history of Indo-European languages.Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of Indo-European StudiesProto-Indo-European verbal syntax1983 • Frederik KortlandtI.
