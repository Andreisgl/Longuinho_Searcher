Nebuchadnezzar I (r. 1125-1104)... more For preorders, click the URL links to Routledge or Amazon.com. Nebuchadnezzar I (r. 1125-1104) was one of the more significant and successful kings to rule Babylonia in the intervening period between the demise of the Kassite Dynasty in the 12th century at the end of the Late Bronze Age, and the emergence of a new, independent Babylonian monarchy in the last quarter of the 7th century. His dynamic reign saw Nebuchadnezzar active on both domestic and foreign fronts. He tended to the needs of the traditional cult sanctuaries and their associated priesthoods in the major cities throughout Babylonia and embarked on military campaigns against both Assyria in the north and Elam to the east. Yet later Babylonian tradition celebrated him for one achievement that was little noted in his own royal inscriptions: the return of the statue of Marduk, Babylon’s patron deity, from captivity in Elam.The Reign of Nebuchadnezzar reconstructs the history of Nebuchadnezzar I’s rule and, drawing upon theoretical treatments of historical and collective memory, examines how stories of his reign were intentionally utilized by later generations of Babylonian scholars and priests to create an historical memory that projected their collective identity and reflected Marduk’s rise to the place of primacy within the Babylonian pantheon in the 1st millennium BCE. It also explores how this historical memory was employed by the urban elite in discourses of power. Nebuchadnezzar I remained a viable symbol, though with diminishing effect, until at least the 3rd century BCE, by which time his memory had almost entirely faded. This study is a valuable resource to students of the Ancient Near East and Nebuchadnezzar, but is also a fascinating exploration of memory creation and exploitation in the ancient world. ISBN-13: 978-1138120402Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Personal Names in Early Neo-Babylonian Legal and Administrative Tablets, 747-626 B.C.E.The period between the accession of Nabonasser, in 747 B.C.E., and the accession of Nabopolasser,... more The period between the accession of Nabonasser, in 747 B.C.E., and the accession of Nabopolasser, in 625 B.C.E., was a period of renewed stability for Babylonia, due in large part to the projection of Assyrian power in the region. During this transitional period, increased economic activity throughout Babylonia resulted in an increase in the amount of written evidence. And the legal and administrative texts that have thus far come to light are, in the works of J. A. Brinkman, “a mine of information for researchers interested in demography, social institutions, economic history, and even ancient technology.” In this volume, John Nielsen provides an index of the personal names found on these texts from this period. As such, the index is a valuable supplement to the Prosopography of the Neo-Assyrian Empire project (Helsinki). Information presented in the book is modeled on the Helsinki project’s publications. The index includes comprehensive cross-references to the CAD, Stamm’s Namengebung, the Helsinki PNAE indexes, Hölscher’s Personennamen, and Knut Tallqvist’s Neubabylonisch Namenbuch.Nielsen’s prosopographical index adds a major new resource to the study of the Neo-Babylonian period.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

KINGS OF CHALDEA AND SONS OF NOBODIES: ASSYRIAN ENGAGEMENT WITH CHALDEA AND THE EMERGENCE OF CHALDEAN POWER IN BABYLONIAStudia Orientalia Electronica,  2021From the ninth century until the last quarter of the seventh century bce, the Assyrian Empire fir... more From the ninth century until the last quarter of the seventh century bce, the Assyrian Empire first extended its power over Babylonia and then engaged in a prolonged effort to retain control. The patchwork nature of Babylonian society-divided as it was between the traditional urban centers, territories controlled by five distinct Chaldean tribes, and regions inhabited by Aramaean tribes-presented opportunities and challenges for Assyria as it sought to assert its dominance. Assyrian interactions with the Chaldean tribes of Babylonia redefined the Chaldeans' place within power relationships in southern Mesopotamia. Starting in 878, Assyria first perceived Chaldean territory as distinct from what they defined as Karduniaš, the land ruled by the king of Babylon. Shalmaneser III exploited and accentuated this division by recognizing the Chaldean leaders as kings and accepting their tribute even as he concluded a treaty with the Babylonian king, Mardukzakir-shumi I. By decentralizing power in Babylonia, Assyria was able to assert indirect control over Babylonia. However, periods of Assyrian weakness created opportunities for several Chaldeansdrawing upon the economic and military power they could muster-to claim the title of king of Babylon with all the accompanying ideological power. These new developments prompted Assyria under the Sargonids to create counter-narratives that questioned the legitimacy of Chaldeans as kings of Babylon by presenting them as strange and inimical to the Assyrian order even as Assyrian interactions with the Chaldeans improved Assyrian familiarity with them.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

(the early Neo-Babylonian period) reveal an emergent use of family names among the elite inhabitants of many of southern Mesopotamia's traditional cultic centers. In Sons and Descendants the author applied a structuralist approach to examine this phenomenon. Less developed were the related questions of to whom were the urban elite projecting their identities and why had it become advantageous to claim such identities. The current work will address these questions by examining cultural contacts between the urban elite, the Assyrian empire, and the Aramean and Chaldean tribal groups present in southern Mesopotamia, and by considering to what degree the use of family names represented a nascent form of Babylonian national consciousness among the urban elite.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
