These underground open spaces harbor a significant amount of microbial communities including mineral-utilizing microorganisms, and represent unique environments for investigating the largely unexplored subsurface life. Karstic caves, generally formed in limestone or other soluble rocks such as dolostone and gypsum, are the most common cave types . In contrast, cavities in granite rock are scarcer and less investigated . These caves result mainly from run-off infiltration through the granite massif discontinuities that causes chemical weathering of the rock complemented with mechanical or physical erosion. The weathering products include more resilient relic minerals, as quartz grains, and newly formed minerals, such as illite, biotite/muscovite, chlorite, and iron oxy-hydroxides. These weathering products are released by disintegration and easily...See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersCoatingsColored Microbial Coatings in Show Caves from the Galapagos Islands (Ecuador): First Microbiological ApproachManuel PereiraThe Galapagos Islands (Ecuador) have a unique ecosystem on Earth due to their outstanding biodiversity and geological features. This also extends to their subterranean heritage, such as volcanic caves, with plenty of secondary mineral deposits, including coralloid-type speleothems and moonmilk deposits. In this study, the bacterial communities associated with speleothems from two lava tubes of Santa Cruz Island were investigated. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) was carried out for the morphological characterization and detection of microbial features associated with moonmilk and coralloid speleothems from Bellavista and Royal Palm Caves. Microbial cells, especially filamentous bacteria in close association with extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), were abundant in both types of speleothems. Furthermore, reticulated filaments and Actinobacteria-like cells were observed by FESEM. The analysis of 16S rDNA revealed the presence of different bacterial phylotypes,...Download Free PDFView PDFiScienceOrganic geochemistry and mineralogy suggest anthropogenic impact in speleothem chemistry from volcanic show caves of the GalapagosPaolo FortiDownload Free PDFView PDFScientific ReportsThe Actinobacterial Colonization of Etruscan Paintings2013 • Valme Juado LoboDownload Free PDFView PDFBiomineralization by Cave Dwelling MicroorganismsValme JuradoDownload Free PDFView PDFArchaeometryVariability and sampling strategy of cave wall concretion: Case study of the moonmilk found in Leye Cave (Dordogne)2018 • Rémy  ChapoulieDownload Free PDFView PDFThe Capuchin Catacombs of Palermo: problems facing the conservation of an impressive burial siteGuadalupe PinarThe Capuchin Catacombs of Palermo contain over 1800 preserved bodies spanning the 16th-20th centuries A.D., many of which now show serious evidence of biodeterioration. In order to protect these remains, an extensive microbiological and molecular investigation was performed to clarify which biological agents are involved in the ongoing deterioration. Within the framework of the “Sicily Mummy Project”, samples were taken from skin, muscle, bone, hair, clothing and stuffing materials. Additional samples were removed from the surrounding wall materials, many of which display an unknown, intriguing rosy discoloration. Finally, air samples were taken to investigate the impact of this microbial contamination on the indoor air quality. The results obtained confirmed the presence of a heavy mould contamination. In some areas of the crypt the fungal spores in the air reached more than 2000 spores/m3. This high concentration of spores is not conducive to the conservation of the human remains ...Download Free PDFView PDFApplied SciencesMicrobial Activity in Subterranean Ecosystems: Recent Advances2020 • TAMARA MARTIN POZASOf the several critical challenges present in environmental microbiology today, one is the assessment of the contribution of microorganisms in the carbon cycle in the Earth-climate system. Karstic subterranean ecosystems have been overlooked until recently. Covering up to 25% of the land surface and acting as a rapid CH4 sink and alternately as a CO2 source or sink, karstic subterranean ecosystems play a decisive role in the carbon cycle in terms of their contribution to the global balance of greenhouse gases. Recent data indicate that microbiota must play a significant ecological role in the biogeochemical processes that control the composition of the subterranean atmosphere, as well as in the availability of nutrients for the ecosystem. Nevertheless, there are still essential gaps in our knowledge concerning the budgets of greenhouse gases at the ecosystem scale and the possible feedback mechanisms between environmental-microclimatic conditions and the rates and type of activity o...Download Free PDFView PDF1 High-throughput Sequencing Analysis of the 2 Actinobacterial Spatial Diversity in Moonmilk 3 Deposits 42018 • Monique CarnolMarta Maciejewska1, Magdalena Całusińska2, Luc Cornet3, Delphine Adam1, Igor S.

SilvaEl Sidrón Cave is an archaeological and anthropological reference site of the Neanderthal world. It shows singular activity related to cannibalisation, and all existing processes are relevant to explain the specific behaviour of the concerned individuals. This paper presents geoarchaeological data, primarily based on mineralogical and petrographic techniques, from an investigation of the nature of the encrustations or hard coatings that affect a large part of the Neanderthal bone remains and their relationship with the depositional and post-depositional processes at the archaeological site. Crusts and patina were found to be numerous and diverse, mainly composed of calcite and siliciclastic grains, with different proportions and textures. The analysis indicated different origins and scenarios from their initial post-mortem accumulation to the final deposit recovered during the archaeological work. The presence of micromorphological features, such as clotted-peloidal micrite, needle-...Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
