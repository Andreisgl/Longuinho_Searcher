This chapter examines what happens to these foster youth after they leave care. It begins with a brief discussion of the motivation for and development of the Title IV-E Independent Living Program and its successor, the John H. Chafee Foster Care Independence Program. It then reviews the literature on the outcomes of former foster youth. The review describes a number of previous studies that have examined the self-sufficiency of foster youth who aged out of care, discusses their methodological limitations, and summarizes the findings from this research. The chapter concludes with a discussion of some unanswered questions that researchers are beginning to address.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
