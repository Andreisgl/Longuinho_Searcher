Design/methodology/approach – A questionnaire survey is administered to 339 managers working in four Malaysian high-tech industries. Findings – The authors find that in most industries, patents are considered as the most effective innovation protection mechanism, while lead time is considered as least effective. In firms with private and foreign ownerships, patents and in firms categorized as “others” “moving quickly down the learning curve” are considered as the most effective protection mechanisms. It also emerges that “being first to market (lead time)” is considered as the least effective protection mechanism under all ownership structures. Further, young and middle-aged firms report patents, while old firms report secrecy as the most effective innovation protection mechanisms. Research limitations/implications – This paper restricted analysis to the high-tech sector in Malaysia, and thus, the findings are not generalizable to other industries. Second, this paper took into consideration only four innovation protection mechanisms. The authors suggest that future research should investigate the issue at hand in other industries and consider other innovation protection mechanisms to have a holistic view of how Malaysian firms view different innovation protection mechanisms. Practical implications – In addition to providing inputs for policy-making, the results of this paper are expected to help practitioners in deciding on the right kind of innovation protection mechanisms for their innovations based on their industry, ownership structure and firm age. Originality/value – This paper is the first of its kind conducted in the Malaysian high-tech sector and as such is expected to help policy-makers to design and implement effectively innovation protection policies.

But it also points that patents are of limited effectiveness against copying. The purpose of this paper is to identify why pharmaceutical firms file patent applications despite the well known limitations of patents as protective devices. A qualitative approach was used to investigate this topic, and the results are based upon six case studies of pharmaceutical organizations established in the United Kingdom. A common response on why firms engage in the patenting process was the long development time of a new product, and the costs associated with that. Thus, the main purpose of pursuing patents was to protect inventions from copying. In addition, our findings revealed that the motivations to patent also encompass their use: i) to deter entry, ii) to enhance appropriability conditions, iii) to secure royalty income, iv) to use in technology negotiations, v) to influence investors perception, vi) to signal to others, and vii) (apparently to a lesser degree) to incentivise researchers.Download Free PDFView PDFResearch PolicyHow much should society fuel the greed of innovators?:: On the relations between appropriability, opportunities and rates of innovation2006 • Luigi MarengoDownload Free PDFView PDFAcademy of Management Conference, August, Honolulu, HawaiiThe paradox of openness: appropriability and the use of external sources of knowledge for innovation2005 • Ammon SalterDownload Free PDFView PDFKnowledge, competition and appropriability: Is strong IPR protection always needed for more and better innovations?2007 • Luigi MarengoDownload Free PDFView PDFEconomics of Innovation and New TechnologyThe impact of vertical R&D cooperation on firm innovation: an empirical investigation2002 • Najib HarabiDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of ManagementHow Firms Capture Value From Their Innovations2013 • michael leibleinDownload Free PDFView PDFHow Firms Capture Value From Their Innovations On behalf of: Southern Management Association can be found at: Journal of Management Additional services and information formichael leibleinOver the past twenty-five years, the technology strategy literature has examined how four primary mechanisms—patents, secrecy, lead time, and complementary assets—influence whether and to what extent firms capture value generated by their innovations. Although this literature has had a profound impact on our understanding of how firms capture value from innovation, we have yet to develop a robust theory that allows us to unbundle the characteristics of institutions, industries, firms, and individual technologies that affect the selection of particular value capture mechanisms. The purpose of this paper is to provide a foundation for addressing these gaps in the literature. We identify and assess relevant scholarly work regarding value capture mechanisms published in top-tier, peer-reviewed management journals between 1980 and 2011. We then review the assumptions, insights, and causal mechanisms for the antecedents and consequences of the value capture mechanisms highlighted in these papers. The ultimate objective is to identify research opportunities that help to better understand the conditions under which specific bundles of value capture mechanisms are most likely to help innovating firms achieve persistent superior performance.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
