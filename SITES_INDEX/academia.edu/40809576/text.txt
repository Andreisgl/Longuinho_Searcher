Focusing on the installation-like ‘environments’ of Roberto Chabet, the community-centred compositions of José Maceda and the interactive performances of David Medalla, Judy Freya Sibayan and Raymundo Albano, it looks at the significance of the term ‘experimental’ in Philippine art at this time, and discusses the intersection between discourse-building, artistic practice and institutional politics.Download Free PDFView PDFLIVING SPECTACLES, EMPOWERING LIVES: THE DYNAMICS OF IMPROVISATION IN PHILIPPINE POLITICAL THEATER 1Glecy AtienzaThis study focuses on the dynamics of improvisation in theater and its impact on the qualities, systems and functions indicated in political theater during the Martial Law period. Drawing from specific experiences in mounting and performing political plays in key cities in the Philippines from 1970-1986, the study aims to underscore how improvisation has influenced the development of an distinct aesthetic quality in Philippine political plays. The study also notes the transformed notions in play production bourne out of the political conditions during the period under study. A postscript on scenarios on current Philippine theater provides an insightful discussion on the impact of improvisation on the current Philippine theater situation.Download Free PDFView PDFArtist as Citizen: Transnational Cultural Work in the National Democratic Movement of the Philippines2014 • Ryan LeanoDownload Free PDFView PDFPathways of Performativity in Contemporary Southeast Asian Art, 27 - 28 June 2019, Haus der Kunst, Munich.2019 • Eva BentchevaThe international symposium Pathways of Performativity in Contemporary Southeast Asian Art casts a spotlight on the fascinating histories of performance practices which speak to the postcolonial, Cold War and politico-economic forces that have shaped Southeast Asia after the Second World War. It brings together renowned scholars and curators from the disciplines of art history, film and music studies, whose work explores the central role of performance in bridging the visual arts, theatre, dance, music and political activism in the region from the 1960s to the present. The conference aims to deepen historical awareness of the long-standing performance-based practices in Southeast Asia, while opening up dialogues around diasporic and migrant entanglements. It explores the relationship between intermediality and historical developments, especially performative practices that have been impacted by advances in technology. This discussion takes on more urgent resonances as it is framed in relation to the notions of 'identity' and 'activism' within the region in light of an increasing policing of the public media platforms. Projecting these discussions into the future, the conference concludes by exploring the intersection of performance and archiving, questioning the possibilities yielded through historicisation and research. The symposium is accompanied by the launch of the exhibition Archives in Residence: Southeast Asia Performance Collection, curated by Eva Bentcheva, Annie Jael Kwan and Damian Lentini, as part of the series 'Archives in Residence' in Haus der Kunst's Archive Gallery. It presents video documentation from the 'Southeast Asia Performance Collection', an expansive research project and digital archive compiled by an international team of researchers and curators in the UK and Asia between 2015 and 2017. This archive contains documentation of performance-based works such as live art, urban and social interventions by over fifty artists from across Southeast Asia and its diasporas. The exhibition presents a selection of these materials for the first time in Germany, and explores the relationship between performativity and digital exchanges, networks and virtual preservation across Southeast Asia, with a particular focus on Cambodia, Vietnam, Singapore and the Philippines. Bringing the ideas behind the symposium and exhibition to life will also be a curated program of live performancesDownload Free PDFView PDFThe Substation, SingaporeSoutheast Asian Art's Contemporary Turn: the role of siting, audience, and performativity STEALING PUBLIC SPACE2020 • iola  lenziIola Lenzi argues a distinctive methodology of Southeast Asian contemporary art whereby public space and intangible public “sites” such as money, national anthems, history, and maps, are co-opted to engage audiences on collective, social issues. Analysing seminal Southeast art from the 1970s onwards, the paper argues that these strategies emerged and have persisted from contextual necessity, and are fundamental to Southeast Asian art's transition to contemporary modes.Download Free PDFView PDFPuro Arte: Filipinos on the Stages of Empire (NYU Press)Introduction to Puro Arte: Filipinos on the Stages of Empire

Recipient of the Cultural Studies Book Award, Awarded by the Asian American Studies Associations in 20142012 • LUCY M. BURNSThis is the introduction to my first book Puro Arte: On the Filipino Performing Body (NYU Press 2012), winner of the Cultural Studies Book Award, Asian American Studies Association, (2012). Puro Arte tracks the emergence of Filipino American theater and performance as it conjoins colonial histories of the Philippines with U.S. race relations and discourses of globalization. In Filipino, puro arte performs a more ironic function, gesturing rather to the labor of over-acting, histrionics, playfulness, and purely over-the-top dramatics. In each chapter, I trace a range of corporeal icons in various performance spaces, which include early plays about the U.S.-Philippine War and Filipinos “displayed” in the 1904 St. Louis World’s Fair, the Filipino patron in the U.S. taxi dance halls, theatrical performances about martial law, and the Filipino performers in the musical global phenomenon Miss Saigon. It is through these multiple and differentiated spaces of performance that I theorize the Filipino performing body as an “archival embodiment” of U.S.-Philippine imperial relations. While I engage with the racialization of Filipinos in the U.S. through the history of imperial relations between the U.S. and the Philippines, I equally emphasize Filipino racial formation in the U.S. as already formed in relation to the racialization of African Americans, other Asians, Native Americans, Latinos, and other subjects of the U.S. empire. I stage a conversation between colonial constructions of/and contemporary performance practices by Filipinos to argue for a consideration of performance not simply as site of uncritical visibility, resistance, or agency, but as a relationship constituted within colonial and neocolonial histories.Download Free PDFView PDFCambodia - Postcolonialism discourse in performance artNguyễn HiềnWhen you mention Cambodia, most people will instantly think of ‘a place of rumor, myth and legend’. After all, it is ‘the only nation in the world that proudly adorns the national flag with a ruin’ – Angkor Wat (A&E Television Networks 2007). In short, Cambodia is popularly known for its past glories and everlasting wars. After 90 years, it achieved independence from French in 1953 only to fell back to 'Year Zero' under Khmer Rouge regime. Finally achieved peace in 1991 (BBC 2015), Kingdom of Cambodia still suffers from unstable politics despite booming economy thanks to agricultural and tourism industries. With temples destroyed, books burnt and scholars massacred, most of Cambodian heritage has survived through storytelling, songs and dances (Thomas n.d). Accordingly, this essay will attempt to explore the influence of postcolonialism on Cambodian performance art. During the past three decades, it has fueled nationalism that soothes war-traumatized Cambodians and helped maintaining cultural autonomy in a converging world.Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of Southeast Asian Studies 50(4)When Art was Political: Historicising Decolonisation and the Cold War in Southeast Asia through Curatorial Practice.
