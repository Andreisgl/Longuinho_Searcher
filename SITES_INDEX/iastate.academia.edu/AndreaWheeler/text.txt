Andrea WheelerIowa State University,  Architecture,  Faculty Member +1The University of Texas at Austin, Architecture, Visiting Big XII Research FellowIowa State University, Architecture, Faculty MemberArchitecture+43Academic Profile from Iowa State University Department of Architecture:  Dr. Andrea Wheeler is Assistant Professor in the Department of Architecture at the Iowa State University, where she contributes to the technical lecture series and is a studio instructor for the Year 4 comprehensive project. She graduated in Architecture from Oxford Brookes University, gained an MPhil from the School of Mechanical Engineering Oxford Brookes University and was awarded a PhD from the University of Nottingham in 2005. In 2007 she was awarded a prestigious three year ESRC/EPSRC fellowship award to examine sustainable schools and subsequently worked as a research fellow for a central UK government research unit Defra. Andrea’s work is about making sustainable buildings. What is different about her research is that she cares about lifestyle change, the actual performance of buildings and about challenging the sustainability agenda in architecture.  Andrea has recently been awarded $12 000 from the New Faculty Seed Funds of the Iowa NSF EPSCoR Energy Utilization platform for a project entitled: Iowa's New Schools: A Future Invested in Sustainability, $3 000 from the Iowa Energy Center entitled: Building a powerful team to research the performance of energy-efficient learning environments. $33,000 from the Provost's Office as an additional start-up package to fund a part-time graduate RA over 3 years. Andrea is a new member of the Center for Building Energy Research (CBER) http://www.iprt.iastate.edu/news/cber-welcomes-dr-andrea-wheelerCourses taught: ARCH245, ARCH 342 ARCH 445 Environmental Systems courses at undergraduate level, ARCH644, ARCH542 Building Technology courses at Graduate Level.ARCH401, ARCH302 Studio design classes at undergraduate level (3rd and 4th years)ARCH 558 Sustainability and Green Architecture.Supervisors: Tom Leslie and Deborah Hauptmannless273 Followers115 Following7 Co-authorsTotal Views ;FollowFollowingall12 Journal Articles6 Chapters in Books37 Conference Presentations (Peer Reviewed)11 Talks, Seminars, Invited Presentations1 GRANT REPORTS/ Final ReportsMore  1 PHD THESIS11 Grants Awarded (USA)5 Grants Awarded (International/ UK)4 Fellowships, Scholarships and Awards2 TEACHING - Syllabi10 TEACHING - Student/ RA Presentations3 Conferences (organized)4 WEBSITES1 BOOK REVIEWS1 IMPACT22 Papers1 Other2 DraftsJournal ArticlesAn Interview with Luce Irigaray on Through Vegetal BeingFull Text available: http://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/cMnwKCjb9KG3ZJrxpmXs/full Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It focusses on three cases of UK secondary schools, demonstrating how users can be inspired to engage with the problems of school design and energy use awareness. The cases provided new insights into the engagement of school teachers, staff and young people regarding issues of sustainability, management, functional performance and comfort. The integrative approach adopted in these cases provided a more holistic understanding of these buildings’ performance than could have been achieved by either observational or more traditional questionnaire-based methods. Moreover, the whole-school approach, involving children in POE, provided researchers with highly contextualised information about how a school is used, how to improve the quality of school experiences (both socially and educationally) and how the school community is contributing to the building's energy performance. These POE methods also provided unique opportunities for children to examine the social and cultural factors impeding the adoption of energy-conscious and sustainable behaviours.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Chapters in BooksRethinking Post-occupancy Evaluation for Sustainable Learning Environmentsby RUCHA V NEWALKAR and Andrea WheelerGreen or sustainable schools are an important building type from which to explore questions of ch... more Green or sustainable schools are an important building type from which to explore questions of changing social behaviors and the often overlooked social dimensions of sustainable development such as equity and inclusion. Building performance studies, including post-occupancy evaluations (POE) are increasingly taking into account behavioral and social dimensions of the build environment, as well as the more common objectives of reductions in energy efficiency, and adopting ethnographic and art-based research methodologies to examine building users’ interaction with their environments. In this paper we examine contemporary evaluation methods in the context of school buildings to explore how some popular POE approaches imply only superficial objectives for green building. The need to create new habits of living and the role of the built environment in this task goes without question; but confronting scientific methods and engineering perspectives typical within the industry, meets professional barriers. In order to improve commonly adopted POE methods in the context of sustainable building, it is important that we are able to contest the meaning of sustainable design and include evaluation tools that have radical educational and transformative objectives, in particular those that allow communities to explore futures that demand both social and technical change. This paper suggests that through user feedback, architects and other building professionals have not only important tools to improve the performance of sustainable buildings, but also to confront the limited expectations of architects and engage users in a sustainable future. POE tools are educational and in listening to users, co-researching ways to transform environments, architects can transform their approaches to sustainable design.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In Exploring Avenues to Interdisciplinary Research: From Cross- to Multi- to Inter-disciplinarity, Maria Karanika-Murray and Rolf Wiesemes (eds.) Nottingham University Press, 2008.  ABSTRACTAre places of social interaction more important than classrooms? Is tackling poverty and social integration first and foremost in sustainable development? This paper examines how Government policy to improve learning and to create sustainable communities, through the new schools building programme Building Schools for the Future, is being addressed by architects and educationalists. It explores a variety of ways of teaching young people about sustainability, but it also demonstrates that young people's attitudes to sustainable lifestyles can illuminate many of the problems of current policy. Participation practices suggest empowerment, citizenship, ownership, place-making and community, but so many questions are still refused within these interactions. Social relationships are key to the well-being of young people in schools, but exploring and encouraging positive relationships through the design of school buildings is poorly researched. Furthermore, questions of well-being have to be ones directed to young people themselves, but current practices of consultation are not necessarily ones that can allow architects or educationalists to listen to and respond to more emotional needs. So can the architect or educationalist work within this context to explore expanded notions of care for the environment and for others? Can he or she respond to what young people are saying? Participation within the Building Schools for the Future (BSF) programme risks becoming tokenistic, but could understanding the relationship between participation and sustainability through new educational philosophies not only counter these accusations, but enable the Government to achieve the dual objectives of providing better learning environments and sustainable schools?Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

 ... more New materialist and ecological futures. Reading Irigaray contra Bradotti on female subjectivity Andrea Gibson and Andrew Gibson  Abstract Can we still become women and men in the post-human world? Will we feel loved? And how will we be sexed? In this paper we explore the work of Rosi Bradotti and Luce Irigaray, firstly to examine the distinctions between both exceptional thinkers in the context of new materialism and secondly, to critically and carefully imagine what would these different worlds look and feel like through the perspectives of Bradotti and Irigaray? Bradotti is influenced by the transformative thinker Luce Irigaray who has changed the course of feminist thinking, but she barely cites her work. Bradotti proposes new futures, new ontologies, but for Irigaray we still have to become women and men and this approach risks dismissing the question of woman before it has been thought. How can we become post-human, she argues, animals, plants, or machines, if we have not yet discovered and culturally recovered what it means to be embodied, sexed, sexuately different, and moreover equal in our differences? Nevertheless, Irigaray’s does propose a future ecological world, one of peaceful co-existence and shared and sexuate living. The material energy of sexuate living sustains sexuate difference.

Through atmosphere we feel our own ... more For the philosopher Gernot Böhme architecture is atmosphere.  Through atmosphere we feel our own presence in space and feel the space in which we are present. But his argument remains extraneous to a feminist agenda, ignoring a history of feminist philosophy that has challenged his philosophicaltradition. While atmosphere might be able to allow architecture to reclaim its aesthetic discourse from the arts, establishing anapproach dependent on “feeling” more than on seeing—experienced through being in it, rather than seeing it or imagining it, his dialogue as many others is gender neutral. And yet the conversation of mood and affect has always been associated with the female.So what if we could rethink atmosphere? What if we could reclaim atmosphere as a feminist approach to architecture? What if the vagueness of atmosphere, belonging neither to the subject nor the architectural environment, could illuminate a path to building a new world to include the dimension of sexuate difference, as is the current language of the philosopher LuceIrigaray? Architectural atmosphere is a contemporary conversation that is positioned as a counterpoint to a performance driven and technical agenda in environmental design. And Irigaray is aninfluential feminist philosopher, now in her eighties, whose work is pivotal to feminist thinking and who has over the course of her career shaped the development of feminist theory. This paper examines how the most contemporary ecological philosophies proposed by the foundational feminist could shape a different sort of understanding of mood or feeling, and challengesuch contemporary theories of atmosphere and affectthat reinforce such distinctions. Philosophical in approach, engaged with the discourse of environment and affect and its language, this paper will propose a living architecture that can include the dimension of sexuate difference.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Masdar is known for its wide range of renewable energy strategies and for its carefully planned and advanced research into these technological developments. This paper explores the renewable energy strategies used in Masdar in comparison with those used in a number of other sustainable cities around the world. Through a critical and comparative study, with the help of research papers and articles, and interviews with the professionals involved with Masdar, the city will be studied in terms of the educational value of this exemplar in its role of leading city transformation. The actual effectiveness and efficiency of the renewable energy systems used in Masdar will be given some careful and critical consideration, and they will be compared to the original designed-for performance predictions; the results will be evaluated in relation to the original intentions and to see if they can be used, in actuality, as a primary approach to developing a sustainable city for future generations.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Wheeler, Andrea (2015) TWO AFFECTIVE AND INTERTWINED SPACE-TIMES AROUSED BY ATMOSPHERE: ON MATERIAL AND IMMATERIAL ARCHITECTURES AS THE PRELUDE TO A PROPER SHARING Sites of Production Conference UCL July 2015Could we have a new thinking on global environmental concerns within the architectural conversati... more Could we have a new thinking on global environmental concerns within the architectural conversation on atmospheres? Could this also attend to an ethic of sexual difference? In this paper, I examine the ways in which the philosophy of Luce Irigaray and her ethical and aesthetic perspectives create such a possibility. This new dialogue provides a prelude to an ecological approach wherein the definition of atmosphere emerges as one of energy, not fossil fuel-based nor renewable energy, but the energy of invitation needed for new subjectivities.Despite the call from Juhani Pallasmaa for an ecological architecture that explores the potential of atmosphere to create our own existential foothold, the current theory of atmospheres in architecture largely overlooks issues of environmental ethics.  To understand the conversation on atmospheres from an ecological perspective however, different philosophies are required to enter the discourse. For Irigaray, the problem in our relationship with natural and built environments is a symptom of an obsession with satisfying our needs rather than cultivating our desires; she argues that we have reached a point wherein we have almost forgotten how to enter an ethical relationship with the beings and things which compose nature. Her work has moved over the course of her career from criticism of the masculine bias within philosophy towards how to forge a relationship between men and women where both have their own relationality and where different approaches are culturally valued, protected and built upon. No ordinary relationship exists in Irigaray’s philosophy. Sexuate difference is a key term, which allows understanding of difference that engages with the distinction between nature and culture; sexuate difference, Irigaray argues, is the first biodiversity that we must take into account.   At this time in the world's history, perhaps more than any other, experiencing architecture shaped through conventional philosophical traditions is not sufficient to address the ecological problems caused, as suggested, by a tragedy in human relationships.The current interest in architectural atmosphere is demonstrated by the popularity of Zumthor’s Atmospheres: Architectural environments, surrounding objects (2006) and Pallasmaa’s The Eyes of the skin: Architecture and the senses (1996), as well as in recent edited collections such as Architectural atmospheres: On the experience and politics of architecture (2014) and Atmospheres: Aesthetics of emotional spaces (2014). Zumthor wrote, “I enter a building, see a room, and in a fraction of a second I have this feeling about it”.  As an immediately grasped indicator of the environmental character of architecture, one can describe atmosphere as a collaboration of a multiplicity of multisensory factors and even as a non-material experience; this is in sharp contrast to our traditional understanding of architecture, which has been interpreted as a material artefact experienced largely through the sense of sight.  Thus, atmosphere calls on our entire embodied and existential sense, stimulating and guiding imagination. Dufrenne posited that atmosphere is a “certain quality which words cannot translate but which communicates itself in arousing a feeling”.  Architectural atmosphere thus cannot be associated simply with a characteristic of interior space, a design approach measuring ambience or mood, or a determination of illumination or of acoustic quality. Dufrenne remarked that the object, in this case the architectural object, arouses a quality that communicates itself through affect. Atmosphere evokes; it stimulates; it promises; it feeds imagination; it is the prelude to new experience. It creates a space-time in excess of the expressed world of the object. Gernot Böhme suggested atmosphere is the prototypical ‘between’ space: “Atmosphere is something between the subject and the object; therefore, aesthetics of atmosphere must also mediate between aesthetics of reception and the aesthetics of the product or production”.  In other words, atmosphere is a quasi-objective experience one can share with others; however, it cannot be described independently of the subject, nor of one's correspondents. Terms such as energy that are more typical of Eastern than of Western philosophical discourse seem more suited to describing such an experience. However, in “Being Two, How Many Eyes Have We”, Irigaray argues that, even our looking constrains us to look at things in ways already understood, nevertheless, living things, natural things, offer a different opportunity. They can liberate our vision and enable new discoveries like a gift of energy, an inspiration.  This paper argues that two affective and intertwined space-times, protecting material and immaterial experience, can be aroused by atmosphere. In this way new cultures of architectural knowledge could be created; meaning can be produced and shared worlds built through dialogue between the two. This recognition of co-existence is the prelude to the proper sharing required in our time. This is not an imaginary site of production, rather it is an invitation to acknowledge the air we breathe as shared, our material resources are shared between us: plants, animals and humans. It is a profound acknowledgment of co-existence: a feeling that provokes an invitation to a new way of being and living together.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Whilst architecture can be utopian in impulse and commonly aims to give material form to new human society, Irigaray’s philosophy does not destroy in its wake the old. New dialogues are needed in architecture that explore how we can reduce our human impact on the earth and live together in peaceful ways. BiographyAndrea Wheeler is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Architecture at Iowa State University.

IT REPRESENTS A WORKING PAPER. ABSTRACTIssues of internal and external air pollution, common diseases afflicting children, and concerns for optimizing learning potential are all important factors to consider in post-occupancy evaluations of air quality in schools. However, children’s perspectives on air quality are largely overlooked. Developing an appropriate methodology to include children is both important and institutionally difficult. This paper examines child-friendly methods of conducting post-occupancy examination of indoor air quality in school settings. It proposes interdisciplinary work on post-occupancy methodologies, engaging with social-science literature on research with children. The paper identifies barriers to the development of an inclusive post-occupancy methodology that can collect both qualitative and quantitative data. It also incorporates children’s experiences by citing research findings from a pilot project that is taking place in a central Iowa school.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Defining sustainable architecture is a notoriously difficult proposition. Ambitious claims abound, demanding a critical distance, but equally important and necessary self-criticisms are heard. Edward Mazria (2013) founder of the Architecture 2030 Challenge, argues that “life depends on design.” Whilst the building sector as a whole, a major emitter of greenhouse gases, is currently making a significant negative impact on the natural environment, it can also be a solution to climate change. Roger Platt, President of the U.S. Green Building Council, recognizing the limitations of the LEED rating tool, argues that we need to expand our definitions of sustainability to include social equity, actual performance, and well-being. Jason McLennan, creator of the Living Building Challenge, sees his role as that of steward and co-creator of a true living future, one that is culturally rich and ecologically restorative. Bjark Ingels calls not for a sterile energy performance engineering of buildings, but instead for “worldcraft,” the craft of making our world: making new and sustainable ways of being in our world, empowering people to transform their own environments. Defining sustainable architecture as building a shared world furthers each of these aims by exploring how, through a radical relationality which includes a relationship to the built environment, human beings can learn not to appropriate resources but instead share living. This presents an ethical and political task—a radical approach to building—to be accomplished together. This shared concept proposes a much bigger environmental picture, but one that reinforces the experiential and qualitative dimension of our lives and of our architecture, arguing against any simple technical approach to creating a sustainable built environment.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This paper critically examines research literature that hasprovided evidence that temperature and air quality are, in a large proportion of classrooms, so pooras to have a negative effect on children’s health and educational performance. This evidence, insupport of mechanical systems that control air quality, contradicts trends towards natural ventilationproposed in order to conserve energy consumption in schools. Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) is generallynot stressed, or indeed challenged, in the program to design sustainable schools, but the questions ofair quality, children’s wellbeing in school and educational performance, raise important issues in thedrive to reduce energy consumption of schools.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The UK has seen a recent growth in the number of Passivhaus schools. These include: Bushbury Hill Passivhaus School (2011); Oakmeadow Passivhaus Primary School (2011); Swillington Passivhaus Primary School (2011); and Wilkinson Passivhaus School (2013).  The US is, however, yet to see such an enthusiastic adoption of Passivhaus standands for schools. This paper will explore both the technical and wider performance qualities of the Passivhaus approach. It will examine the feasibility of Passivhaus methods for schools in the US, examining barriers of perception and performance. Passivhaus excels as a method to address energy efficiency, but schools operate at a number of other levels not only energy performance, and this paper examines through qualitative and quantitative data how Passivhaus standards may effects in aspects of school design. Over the summer of 2014 case studies will be prepared of UK Passivhaus standard schools. Data will be collected on the current energy performance of those buildings. Architects will be interviewed about the design and construction process of the schools, and visits will be made to school buildings to collect information through interview about building management, user perceptions and behaviors. Where energy performance is being monitored and post-occupancy data has already been collected, this will also be utilized. This work will be carried out in collaboration with technical experts in the Department of Architecture, the University of Bath. Currently, researchers are aware of only one school has been built in the US to Passivhaus standards: Center for Energy Efficient Design (CEED) in Franklin County, Virginia. In order to make comparison with UK schools, data will be collected examining the performance of this school. Telephone interviews will also be carried out with stakeholders, the architect, construction team and building occupants. As schools operate at a number of other levels, perceptions about Passivhaus Schools will be effected by a wider community involved in school designs and an online questionnaires will be developed and sent to stakeholders to determine these wider perceptions.It is anticipated that barriers to the adoption of Passivhaus standards in schools in the US will be seen to span the range of concerns from design, to construction and building management. It is also anticipated that the single school built in the US will be seen to rate well in comparison to the apparently excellent performance of UK Passivhaus Schools. The aims of the paper are to determine what lessons learnt in the UK can be adopted in the US and what real and perceived barriers prevent the wider adoption of the method.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This paper speculates on the future for the design of the ‘sustainable’ school. It poses the following questions: are there new ways of thinking, living and being emerging, demanding support from educationalists; and does the ‘sustainable’ school and its design, provide a testing ground for supporting changes in patterns of living? These questions are explored and illustrated through the dialogue, drawings, narratives and performances of secondary school children. The paper draws heavily on theories of participation with children and adopts educational philosophy and architectural theory to present a critical review of themes emerging from workshops with secondary school children. Governments have to begin to take steps to account for natural and social capital and beyond meeting merely material goals towards a range of outcomes captured through the use of the term 'wellbeing'. It is not a matter of lifestyle practices, we can or cannot adopt, it demands both ontological and political interrogation: what does it mean to be in an ethical or just relation to the environment and to other human beings? Who is this historical human being characterised so well by his/her exploitation of the natural environment and how do we understand his or her rights? The paper examines how children engage with these sorts of ideas and creatively envision pedagogical and associated design solutions.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It discusses work carried out in a series of workshops with young people in UK schools in the East and West Midlands, South Yorkshire. Whilst POE methodologies allow an examination of the physical, technical and management factors influencing the actual performance of building, using action research based participatory and co-research methods also gives an opportunity to explore children's knowledge, attitudes and behaviours towards low carbon buildings and living more sustainable lifestyle, and this influence on energy behaviours. Intergenerational influence, often goes unacknowledged: children’s attitudes, knowledge and behaviours (and school-based education for sustainability) has influence within households, as do the experiences of the older generation able to reflect on consumerism and unfettered spending. Understanding why our energy use and our relationship to the natural resources has to change raises, complex social issues, but schools provide a unique opportunity for feedback tools not only improve the performance of 'sustainable' architecture but also to address how we can motivate more sustainable lifestyles.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Its aims were described as transforming learning and embedding sustainability into the life experience of every child. However, how do young people understand these aims, and the concepts of sustainable lifestyles and sustainable communities, now they have begun to be translated into school design? This paper reports on the recently suspended programme and discusses the value of Post Occupancy Evaluation (POE) as a way of capturing successes and failures of what has been implemented so far. POE provides an opportunity for young people to critically engage with why our energy use and our relationship with the natural environment has to change. POE can also examine the gap between predicted and actual energy performance of a building and human behaviour is key in such investigations. The focus on innovative technologies is in danger of ignoring the human factors involved in reducing our impact on the environment. Current approaches used in Education for Sustainability can also ignore the complex social aspects of encouraging sustainable lifestyles. This paper describes an emergent POE approach developed and used to carried out research with young people in the UK using this method. It examines reoccurring themes across case studies and describes young peoples’ experience with contradictory adults’ behaviours. If we are to meet the needs of future generations, we will all have to be able to design for ourselves – albeit in negotiation with others – environments in which we can live in different ways. Participatory post-occupancy assessments hence have multiple benefits, whilst for architects, they provide feedback on the performance of buildings; for young people they are also creative opportunities to begin to explore sustainable development, with all the philosophical and political complexities this entails, and to begin to rethink and redesign their lifestyles.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It demonstrates how methods adopted can be used to enhance student experience and improve retention. Initial research with students found that the difference between student experience in initial and final years can be characterised by concern over the independent study required for the dissertation project and associated worries of managing workloads with competing deadlines. Interviews and workshops with students also identified a wider concern about the quality of relationships with technical, administrative and academic staff. In addition, research found that the final year can be flooded by concerns over employability. Fundamental to these issues are student relationships. Using the methods of Service Design and Data Mining the project designed, implemented and assessed a number of initiatives aimed at alleviating these student concerns. Key to the theory of Service Design is the management of points of contact with service providers and vital to Data Mining is the identification of patterns of behaviour that could predict non-completion. Service Design aims to provide customer focused highly desirable services. Whilst, on the other hand, data mining aims to identify signals that determine those at risk of not completing courses. This paper examines the use of Service Design and Data Mining in Higher Education from the results of the project and determined that whilst the methods can be used in a complementary manner, each derives from different paradigms of knowledge.  Keywords: Service Design, Teaching and Learning, Higher Education, Undergraduates, Data Mining.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The language of concern is even changing from a discussion of architecture to that of the apparently more inclusive, but also science-based, engineering focused, performance driven, calculable, quantifiable: built environment. As we begin to understand the limits of our economic growth and recognize our finite reserves of natural resources; and in the knowledge of irreversible environmental change, exhausted by our voracious desires to consume: we have to submit that our ways of living, and our patterns of occupation, somehow, and in some way have to change.  New ways to inhabit, new ways to relate to other living beings, greater hospitality; the sentiment is not in question: but confronting the methods of our scientific norms and the assiduity of accounting perspectives that promise to shape potential future and ecologically resilient worlds, this is a barrier that limits questions about the nature of our relationship with the natural environment and other living beings. Climate change while it is dominated by a scientific discourse, does not fully address what it means to live or what it feels to live; nor examines how our ways of living are shaped by bodies, unexamined collective histories and unexplored desires. What it is to be human - as man and woman - in the face of an uncontrollable forces of nature (which has to be stated has always been uncontrollable) for the most part, cannot acknowledge the question of an ecological belonging, especially for both man and womanSo why seek to engage the discipline of architecture that is questioning its ecological impact, in how we might build love, and a natural energy for becoming, between us? And why give concern to questioning our relationships with nature and others as limited by the perspectives of science (but also of more traditional philosophical engagements) or think about the reality of different intimacies between the sexes and genders, with real and hidden intimacies?

I adopted team-based and collaborative learning as a method especially appropriate for sustainable designers. This required team activities on research problems to solve, but the final research essay assignment remained an individual activity. The problem the class presented was one of evaluating the benefit of teamwork within the course objectives. In Fall Semester 2014 I inherited a course that had not been offered for more than five years but had remained in the course catalogue. The description was concise, as is typical of the University catalogue, and there was no syllabus recorded to guide on either content or approach to teaching. I took it upon myself in the semester prior to develop the syllabus, objectives, content, and methods of delivery, with only minor changes to the description (see Figure 1) carried out in the Spring semester. The course develops around the position that the challenge of sustainability in design is a matter of situationally specific interpretation rather than the setting of universal goals [1].Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Each sense can ... more Comfort is defined through human senses; sight, hearing, smell, touch and taste.  Each sense can lead to a greater or lesser degree of comfort. Yet, children experience comfort differently to adults. They experience spaces differently and have knowledge about the performance of a building different to adult users; they can also have a perspective on design quality that is unlike that of the architect. School is a designed environment that a child lives in for over 6 hours a day; it is it is thus argued simply a matter of a child’s right to be consulted about his or her day-to-day environment. However, the reasons that children are not included in post-occupancy evaluations include: a trend towards the standardization of methods in order to collect data comparable for building types; a persistent prejudice against the value of children’s experience deeming children unreliable research participants; and simply because of the difficulty developing methods appropriate for children. Interviews and questionnaires are examples of such typical research methods. Designing a tool that includes children’s perspectives has value not only in terms of improving building performance, and thereby energy performance but in delivering the educational objectives of schooling and in ensuring health and wellbeing at both physical and developmental levels.Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) is well known for its effects on children’s health, wellbeing, and educational performance, for example, and daylighting has been proved as equally important. Design and space provision is a slightly more slippery issue in determining the link with educational performance, nevertheless, studies have examined this [1]; the question of different comfort levels and designing to children’s comfort levels in school tends to be limited to specific medical or developmental issues and Special Needs.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This was a period when London was at the center of renewed artistic activity, London was economical vibrant and an art movement described as Young British Art or Brit Art was emerging.  Architects were also beginning to propose environmental stewardship as a motivation for design. The proposed grant will allow the Principal Investigator Dr. Andrea Wheeler to develop the educational program based around walking tours and gallery visits, experiencing the districts, neighborhoods and architecture of London. These tours will allow students to experience the many layers of social and architectural history in the city, ultimately arriving at the boom period of art and and architecture. London is a truly cosmopolitan city, a world city. It has welcomed continuous waves of ethnically diverse peoples. As early as the C17th and C18th Huguenot refugees arrived from France; and Jewish immigrants from Germany and Eastern Europe; this was followed by women and men from Africa, the Caribbean, Europe, China and India. Almost every race, color, nation and religion on earth is represented, and this has led to one of the richest and most diverse social histories played out in the city streets and neighborhoods. This diversity gives London its vibrancy and creativity and student will experience this directly during the visit.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Loughborough University’s construction programmes are exceptional for their links to industry but an average of 25% of undergraduate students still lack this important experience. In the past, bachelor students had access to ‘industrial tutors’, giving them a chance to experience day-to-day activities of local engineers’ professional life. More recently the Institution of Civil Engineers established an Ambassadors programme where professionals engage with young people. In response, this research seeks to reinstate the role of the ‘industrial tutor’ through an e-mentoring initiative, exploiting the latest free and readily available technology, to foster awareness of practice and the needs of employers. Knowledge and understanding of employer needs and professional practices will give students an obvious advantage in finding employment through first-hand knowledge of life in industry. It will benefit the industry in producing more useful young professionals, better able to meet their changing needs, including personal, social and professional networking skills.  The proposed e-mentoring programme will develop, test and evaluate the benefits of student interaction with industrial mentors. The students will include undergraduates and postgraduates who typically have less contact with industry, and international students whose needs in terms of employability have been poorly addressed by HEIs. The mentors will be drawn from the many industrial connections of the School, and in particular alumni who are currently in practice and wish to help support students in their former department. The research will provide evidence and insights for an improved curriculum aimed at employability and meeting the needs of international students.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Zumthor writes: “I enter a building, see a room, and – in a fraction of a second – I have this feeling about it” (Zumthor 2006: 13). Juhani Pallasmaa argues that “ …the immediate judgement of character of space calls upon our entire embodied and existential sense, …atmosphere stimulates activities and guides imagination” (Pallasmaa 2014: 19).  ARCH 458X will teach students to think critically and independently about the nature of “architectural atmosphere”, and to comprehend the relationship between atmosphere, feeling, mood and architecture. It will also pose questions about how thinking on global environmental concerns, on sustainability in architecture, relates to these understandings. Despite a call from Pallasmaa (2014) for an ecological architecture that explores the potential of atmosphere to create an existential foothold, theories currently largely overlook issues of environmental concern.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Sustainable Schools and Equityby Zeinab Amiri and Andrea WheelerSustainable schools should provide a healthy and environmentally conscious education for all chil... more Sustainable schools should provide a healthy and environmentally conscious education for all children. They should be a places where equal importance is given to the three pillars of sustainability: environmental, economy and social sustainability. Although various sustainable design projects meet environmental and economical factors and make efforts at influencing our communities, in the meanwhile many also neglect the social aspect of sustainability maintaining educational disadvantage amongst students. In the current era, where world leaders are challenged with the problems of social cohesion, social and educational equity seem to be some of the common factors which are underestimated and neglected. In this research, we analyze and synthesize two different, but related discourses, sustainable schools and equal education, and converge them to argue for sustainable schools’ practices and equal education opportunities for children. To have a sustainable school, an integrated approach contemplating all physical, educational and organizational elements is necessary. Although a sustainable school is more than any performance assessment standards, here we mostly focus on performance to see whether schools with performance assessment standards such as LEED can provide equal education or not. In other words, we analyze and criticize frameworks and performance assessment tools for sustainable buildings in terms of social sustainability and equity. Accordingly, a number of case studies will be examined in the study and assessed on the basis of actual performance versus designed performance taking into account the question of social equity. Case studies chosen within the United States will be those documented as successful sustainable school projects. This study will be done on the basis of interviews with children in these particular schools (where available) and also by obtaining data about the particular schools from related journals and articles. The value of this work is in providing a platform to improve the performance standards of schools and also to evaluate the outcomes of the successful design strategies in terms of social equity.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Designing a Child Participated Building Evaluation Tool: A Review of Literature (Naghmeh Pak and Andrea Wheeler)by Andrea Wheeler and Melody PakBecause the foundation of an individual’s health and well-being is laid in their childhood, evalu... more Because the foundation of an individual’s health and well-being is laid in their childhood, evaluating health and comfort factors in the environments in which children live is essential. Children have a different perspective on design quality and define comfort differently from that of adults, but schools are generally designed without consultation with children. School is a designed setting that a child resides in on a daily basis, and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child argues that it is simply a matter of a child’s right to be consulted about his or her day-to-day environment, “the child’s views must be considered and taken into account in all matters affecting him or her” [1]. However, the reasons that children are not included in the evaluation of buildings include a trend toward the standardization of methods in order to collect data comparable for building types; but also a persistent prejudice against the value of children’s experiences, deeming children unreliable research participants [2]. It can simply be the difficulty in developing methods appropriate for children. Architectural engineering has yet to respond to the rights of the child.Comfort is defined through human senses: sight, hearing, smell, touch, and taste. Each sense can lead to a greater or lesser degree of comfort. However, children experience comfort differently from adults [3]. They experience spaces differently and have knowledge about the performance of a building that is different from adult users; they can also have a perspective on design quality that is unlike that of the architect. Designing a tool that includes children’s perspectives has value not only in terms of improving building performance, and thereby energy performance, but also in delivering the educational objectives of schooling and in ensuring health and wellbeing at both the physical and developmental levels, providing healthy human beings for the future.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The problem designers have however is with the human condition: irascible, unpredictable, uncontrollable, acting against all their best architectural intentions. The crooked timber of humanity refers to the work of Immanuel Kant and to Isaiah Berlin who adopted the quote to suggest that the world, being run by humans, will always be imperfect but the feminist approach suggested in this paper is a recognition that climate change demands deeper transformations of economy, cultural and political life. This paper is in two parts, a philosophical discussion of the human condition and a dialogue with an engineer exploring the design of tall wooden buildings. This paper is an appeal to architects and engineers to engage with profound questions of living and in this way examine how practices of design thinking will need to change.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

By then, an estimated three billion people will need a home. Within this same time domain – if carbon emissions remain unabated – potentially catastrophic climate scenarios may become a reality. Yet the need for housing cannot be ignored, and will require an extensive level of construction – a process which accounts for almost half of all human-responsible carbon emissions. We must conclude that world housing and climate change are on a collision course due to their diametrically opposed demands. The answer to this problem is twofold: a majority of future housing construction must be of at least a moderate density – between five and fifteen stories, and must yield a small carbon footprint. Steel and concrete are almost exclusively relied upon for buildings of such a nature, yet represent 3% and 5% of total carbon emissions in the world respectively. Recent advances in the realm of wood laminate construction offer an alternative way however. Cross-laminated timber (CLT) – a wood composite – can be locally sourced from renewable materials in a manner which actually sequesters carbon from the atmosphere. The research would suggest the potential for buildings composed of a purely wood structure to reach up to twenty stories. Composite systems which combine a concrete core with wood columns and beams could further this achievement to almost forty stories. The implementation of CLT is occurring slowly, but case studies do exist. This poster will explore these precedence within the context of the compelling reasoning for their investigation, and will attempt to chart the future of this technology.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

However, it is commonly known that discrepancies exist between the predicted/optimised and the actual performance of buildings when they are in use, which may result in additional re-design and refurbishment costs to bring the buildings’ performance to the initial design objectives in terms of energy use and occupants’ comfort. Some of the causes of the above performance shortfalls are attributed to the inherent limitations associated with the use of simulation tools (namely, the lack of information on the exact characteristics of the building, especially in the early design stages and the simplifications and assumptions built into the mathematical models on which the tools are based). Other causes known to have more significant effects on the building’s performance are related to factors that are beyond the scope of building desig...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

 ... more New materialist and ecological futures. Reading Irigaray contra Bradotti on female subjectivity Andrea Gibson and Andrew Gibson  Abstract Can we still become women and men in the post-human world? Will we feel loved? And how will we be sexed? In this paper we explore the work of Rosi Bradotti and Luce Irigaray, firstly to examine the distinctions between both exceptional thinkers in the context of new materialism and secondly, to critically and carefully imagine what would these different worlds look and feel like through the perspectives of Bradotti and Irigaray? Bradotti is influenced by the transformative thinker Luce Irigaray who has changed the course of feminist thinking, but she barely cites her work. Bradotti proposes new futures, new ontologies, but for Irigaray we still have to become women and men and this approach risks dismissing the question of woman before it has been thought. How can we become post-human, she argues, animals, plants, or machines, if we have not yet discovered and culturally recovered what it means to be embodied, sexed, sexuately different, and moreover equal in our differences? Nevertheless, Irigaray’s does propose a future ecological world, one of peaceful co-existence and shared and sexuate living. The material energy of sexuate living sustains sexuate difference. But which is utopia, and which living?Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
