However, due to the absence of comprehensive studies on Luther’s contexts, a thorough and detailed analysis of this influence in Luther’s thought and writings has been hindered. The aforementioned circumstance has resulted in the overall disregard of this contribution in the history of Western philosophy. This paper aims to analyze the distinct impact of Renaissance ideology on the evolution of Luther’s concept of liberty. The first section will discuss the background of Luther’s reform movement and the fundamental place of the humanist concept of liberty in its impact on the destruction of the religious power of the Catholic Church. The second section will examine the significant role played by humanists, such as Erasmus, in shaping Luther’s liberal ideas during his early years.

Two Kinds of Love: On the Interpretation of Luther's View of Love by the Finnish School MannermaaInternational Journal of Sino-Western StudiesIn the midst of the dilemmas facing the history of contemporary Western theory, Martin Luther&#39... more In the midst of the dilemmas facing the history of contemporary Western theory, Martin Luther&#39;s concept of love and his theology of the Decalogue have been given more and more attention by more and more researchers. The interpretation of Luther&#39;s concept of love by the Finnish school in contemporary Lutheran studies has also been increasingly recognized. In this paper, we will discuss the interpretation of Luther&#39;s view of love by Mannermaa, the father of the Finnish school. The first two sections of the paper will deal with Luther&#39;s critique of the view of love ruled by the Greek philosophical tradition and the Catholic ‘theology of Glory’ in Mannermaa’s interpretation. The third section will introduce the important themes of faith and salvation in Luther&#39;s ‘theology of the Cross’ by discussing Mannermaa’s interpretation about love, thus highlighting the importance of the theme of love in theology. The last section will further discuss the inheritance of Luther&...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It is very specific and real. The &quot;seven characteristics&quot; he summarized, summed up the attributes of God in the Bible or Christianity into seven characteristics, which I think is quite accurate: an adjective in front, a noun in the back, and adjectives are indispensable (if I have time later, I will explain it ), and the nouns are also very accurate (if I have time, I will also say my improvement opinions on his summary, which is more important in my opinion). He has done in-depth research on ancient Chinese books, such as paying attention to how many times &quot;God&quot; and &quot;Heaven&quot; appear in oracle bone inscriptions. This is a very real academic work, which I admire very much.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Is it a literature, humanistic document, the Word of God, or a record of God-man interaction?

How did you start your religious life? Your experience of reciting Biblical texts and the influence of Dr. Richard Deutsch and Professor David Flusserto on your academic career, and your experience of Biblical studies at Edinburg University. 2) Core questions in your academic research: the relationship between theology and religions, cross-contextual and textual reading and presuppositions, the influence of your faith on your academic research, the relationship between the Canon and doctrines, to read the original Hebrew Biblical texts in Classic Chinese. 3) Has an over- optimistic humanistic presupposition controlled your research? If you put aside the doctrines of Christianity while reading the Hebrew Bible, how do you deal with your own presuppositions? Is it possible that you are proclaiming a different Gospel from the Apostle Paul? Are you going to fall into relativism or nihilism? If your strategy is to deconstruct first and to reconstruct later, are you worried that you will stray from Christian Orthodox doctrine? 4) The plan of Hebrew Biblical scholars’ training in Chinese academia: You have strategically trained over ten Hebrew Biblical scholars for Chinese academia, and you have deeply influenced the present state of Hebrew Biblical studies in Chinese language. 5) Sino-Christian Academic Biblical Studies in the Light of the Great Guoxue: In order to deconstruct the narrow-minded guoxue (Chinese national studies) and to include Biblical studies in Chinese academia officially, I have invented this concept and have published two monographs and several articles related to it. The Bible is usually accepted as literary fiction, a humanistic document, or the Word of God, but you consider the Bible as a record of God-Man interaction. 6) What is the relationship between your academic research and Christian orthodox doctrines? Do any of your research results subvert the traditional teachings of Christianity? You have invented and developed cross-textual reading &amp;amp; hermeneutics. Facing inter-religious dialogue, or comparative religions, how do you read the Hebrew Bible in your own context of pluralistic classics. Can you find biblical evidence to support the doctrines of the Trinity and Original Sin? A scholar should pay attention to the ambiguity and transcendence of the Bible – do you find any Hebrew Biblical text to prove that God is omniscient and has omnipotentiality? 7) What is the basis for your own theories? This is to say, what allows them to withstand scrutiny? You have done Hebrew Biblical hermeneutical research with your own understanding / teaching / interpretation as the presupposition, how do you interpret Martin Luther’s Sola Scriptura? What is the authority for you? In addition to humanistic reason, do you believe that God has a revelation for you especially? 8) The outlook of the development of Biblical studies in Chinese academia. 9) The problem of the Canon’s absoluteness. 提要：本对话于2018年8月2日在赫尔辛基大学举行，主要包括如下内容：一、您个人的生活经历和学历中有哪些事件对你今天的学术道路，包括你所从事的这个事业和你的思想的形成产生一些重要的影响？你怎么会产生宗教情怀？背诵《圣经》经文的经历， 戴智民博士（Dr. Richard Deutsch）的影响，著名的学者Professor David Flusser的影响，爱丁堡大学的希伯来《圣经》研究。二、学术研究中的核心问题：神学与宗教之间的问题，跨语境和跨文本阅读与前见，您的信仰对学术研究的影响，“经”与“教”的关系，以中国的经典来读希伯来《圣经》的原文。三、你的研究是否会被你自己的过分人文主义“前见”所控制? 把“教”放下来去读“经”的时候，你如何处理你自己的“前见”？你是否会在传一个不同于使徒保罗所传的福音？你会否导致相对主义或虚无主义？先解构，再建构，您不担心离经背道吗？四、汉语学界的希伯来《圣经》研究及人才培养：人才培养计划，中国大陆本土培养的希伯来《圣经》研究学者。五、大国学视野中的汉语学术圣经学：我所构建的《大国学视野中的汉语学术圣经学》为了解构狭隘国学，并为在汉语学界进行基督教研究获得合法性。《圣经》不仅是神的话语、文学艺术作品和人文经典，而且是神人交碰的记载，无论你信它是上帝，还是不信它是上帝，它有上帝的话。如果你真的去研究这个话，它就会成为一个对你生命有意义的话。六、你的学术研究与基督教传统教义之间的关系是什么? 你的颠覆了传统教义的研究成果是什么？Cross textual reading（跨文本阅读、跨文本诠释）与inter-religious（宗教间对话） 或comparative religions （比较宗教学），您自己如何在多元亚洲经典处境中进行《圣经》阅读？三位一体、原罪等教义有《圣经》根据吗？如何关注《圣经》的模糊性和超越性？旧约里有“上帝是全知全能”这方面的经文吗？七、你自己的学说也就是“教”，得以站立的根据是什么? 你以你自己的理解来代替“教”而解经，如何理解路德的“唯独《圣经》”？你的“权威”是什么? 除去人文理性之外，你相信上帝对你有启示吗？八、汉语学界《圣经》学今后发展的展望。九、“经”的绝对性与否的问题。 No. 18, June 2020, www.SinoWesternStudies.comSave to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The New Leftists in contemporary China claim to fight for the weaker members of society, for justice and equality, but they easily become the supporters of a Leviathan that destroys all power that may threaten the state. Liberalism in contemporary China is like a Wild Horse, which can bring many benefits to the state and its people, since it is alive and longs for liberty; but it can also easily fall into disorder and chaos, because it breaks all kinds of restrictions. The negative sides of the Leviathan and of the Wild Horse can be limited but cannot be solved by democracy and law, because human rationality cannot reach the perfection it longs for due to its innate limitations. Similarly, the negative sides of Chinese New Leftism have not only to do with the limitations of human rationality and reason, but they easily cooperate with narrow-minded nationalism, populism, violent despotism and totalitarianism. Consequently, it is important to refer to the transcendent viewpoint of Christianity, so as to avoid both absolutism and idolism. The main contribution that Christianity can give to the debate between Chinese New leftism and Liberalism is to offer a totally new value system and a new structure of knowledge.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

They recalled and reflected on the &quot;Second Enlightenment&quot; in China that began in 1978. Then they reflected on the Absoluteness, modernity and freedom in Chinese context from the perspective of comparative Chinese and Western philosophy. By a review of their academic research, they exchanged ideas on current hot topics in Chinese philosophical research, how the development of Chinese philosophy in the context of globalization can be adapted to Chinese society. Issues of temporality, freedom, individual subjectivity and the Absolute are discussed in the context of modernity, liberalism and the revival of Chinese classical studies. The two scholars call for attention to Luther and the advent of the Third Enlightenment as a way of rectifying the flaws left by the beheading of Western and Eastern philosophical thought.

Thus, it is crucial to define what a jing (canon) is and why a jing (canon) holds authority. After an analysis on the concepts of Canons and the study of Canons in Chinese and Western Contexts, the present author draws a contrast between the Confucian Canons in the light of Western studies and the Western Canons in the light of Confucianism. He will come to the conclusion that the key to understanding these two traditions and their studies of Canons lies in the authority that elevates a classic into a Canon. It is to say, where does the authority come from? Is it a divine revelation from the top-down or a human exploration from the bottom-up？This determines whether the authority of a Canon is metaphysically absolute, eternal and unchangeable. If not, is it physically relativ...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

My aim is to explore some of the major challenges and opportunities facing the Christian Church in twenty-first-century China. I approach this from the theoretical and practical perspective of a broadly construed cultural encounter between Christianity and contemporary China. To understand the problems and possibilities facing the Chinese Church, we need to locate these in the context of China’s historic Confucian identity, its past and present communist ideology, and its new economic and political global identity. Before exploring three specific challenges and opportunities, the article introduces the author’s own typology of twenty-first-century China.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Rising from an extraordinary 2003 Sino-Nordic conference on Chinese contextual theology which brought Chinese university scholars and church theologians together for the first time Christianity and Chinese Culture addresses ways in which the church in China is responding to that challenge. The essays collected here highlight both the stunning complexities confronting Protestant Christianity in China and its remarkable potential. This is a most timely publication on the current issues and research on Christianity and Chinese culture in the PRC previously unavailable in English. The list of scholars in the collection reads like a Who s Who? in Christian studies in China, including both secular academics and Christian theologians. The final part on theological reconstruction is of particular interest, given its importance for the Protestant churches in the last decade. This book should be on the shelf of any scholar interested in the subject.
