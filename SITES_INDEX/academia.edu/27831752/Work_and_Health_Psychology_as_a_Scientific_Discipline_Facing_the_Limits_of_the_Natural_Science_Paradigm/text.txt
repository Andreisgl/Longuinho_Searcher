It focuses on organizational characteristics as well as individual factors, which can have an impact on the social workers’ work performance. Τhe method of collecting qualitative data was conducted using semi – structured interviews with twelve professional Social Workers employed in different non-governmental organizations. Results show that important sources of work stress for these social workers include the excessive workload, working overtime, dealing with role ambiguity/conflict and ethical dilemmas in the workplace, and having to confront unmet personal expectations and a negative public perception of the profession. These work stressors combined with the insufficient support and understanding by the supervisor and colleagues, may lead to occupational stress and burnout symptoms. Findings highlight the fact that awareness and understanding of the impact of occupational stress could be a primary focus of prevention of burnout among professional Social Workers.Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of Transnational ManagementBenefits of Recovery after Work among Egyptian Managers2009 • Aycan BayerAn increasing body of research findings has consistently shown that work stressors are associated with lower levels of work satisfaction and psychological well-being. It has been suggested that recovery after the work day may reduce fatigue, restore mood, and improve well-being. This study examined predictors and consequences of four recovery experiences (psychological detachment, relaxation, mastery, control) identified by Sonnentag and Fritz (2007) to replicate and extend their work. Data were collected from 242 men and women managers and professionals working in various organizations and industries in Egypt using anonymously completed questionnaires, a 48% response rate. The four recovery experiences were, with one exception, positively and significantly correlated. Personal demographic variables (e.g., gender, age, level of education, marital status) had relationships with use of particular recovery experiences. Both workaholic job behaviors and job demands were negatively associated with use of psychological detachment and relaxation. Use of particular recovery experiences had complex relationships with work outcomes, sometimes being associated with positive work outcomes and sometimes with negative work outcomes. Somewhat surprisingly, use of recovery experiences were unrelated to four indicators of psychological well-being. These findings provided only partial support for previous results obtained in Germany and reported by Sonnentag and Fritz.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
