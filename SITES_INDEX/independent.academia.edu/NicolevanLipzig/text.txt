Influence of the circumglobal wave-train on European summer precipitationby Sajjad Saeed and Nicole van LipzigClimate Dynamics,  2013ABSTRACT We investigate European summer (July–August) precipitation variability and its global te... more ABSTRACT We investigate European summer (July–August) precipitation variability and its global teleconnections using the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data (1950–2010) and a historical Coupled Model Intercomparison Project climate simulation (1901–2005) carried out using the ECHAM6/MPIOM climate model. A wavelike pattern is found in the upper tropospheric levels (200 hPa) similar to the summer circumglobal wave train (CGT) extending from the North Pacific to the Eurasian region. The positive phase of the CGT is associated with upper level anomalous low (high) pressure over western (eastern) Europe. It is further associated with a dipole-like precipitation pattern over Europe entailing significantly enhanced (reduced) precipitation over the western (eastern) region. The anomalous circulation features and associated summer precipitation pattern over Europe inverts for the negative CGT phase. Accordingly, the global teleconnection pattern of a precipitation index summarizing summer precipitation over Western Europe entails an upper level signature which consists of a CGT-like wave pattern extending from the North Pacific to Eurasia. The imprint of the CGT on European summer precipitation is distinct from that of the summer North Atlantic Oscillation, despite the two modes of variability bear strong similarities in their upper level atmospheric pattern over Western Europe. The analysis of simulated CGT features and of its climatic implications for the European region substantiates the existence of the CGT-European summer precipitation connection. The summer CGT in the mid-latitude therefore adds to the list of the modes of large-scale atmospheric variability significantly influencing European summer precipitation variability.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Regional climate models have proven to be suitable tools for this purpose, but only if they realistically represent the meteorological conditions in the region of interest. It is important to evaluate not only the net accumulation in the models, but also the processes leading to precipitation. Clouds are of importance both for precipitation formation and for the surface radiative budget. As there is a lack of data on the clouds and precipitation processes in the Antarctic, the first goal of our project is to establish a new database that can be used for an in-depth model evaluation.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

How... more Lake Chad was once one of the largest lakes in Africa with a surface area of about 25000 km². However, because of a series of droughts that began in the 1960's, the lake has shrunk to almost one-tenth of its maximum area. Also anthropogenic influences like the drilling of boreholes and large-scale irrigation systems have played their role in the demise of the lake. The disappearance of such a large open-water body in the semi-arid Sahel environment can be expected to have a noticeable effect on the meteorology in the surroundings of the lake. The impact could extend even further to the west as a lot of westward propagating convective systems pass Lake Chad in the rainfall season. To test this hypothesis, three Lake Chad scenarios are applied in a regional atmospheric model that simulates the rainfall season of 2006 (July-September). The scenarios reflect the situation in the 1960's with a large lake, the present day situation and a possible future scenario where the lake is completely desiccated. The model used for this study is the Advanced Regional Prediction System (ARPS), developed at the University of Oklahoma. The model is already extensively used and validated for the Sahelian environment. The simulations are performed with a horizontal resolution of 15 km which is high enough to gain insight in possible alterations of passing convective systems. Preliminary results show that the modelled total rainfall amounts compare well with best-estimate precipitation images from the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM). The shrinking of Lake Chad seems to have a significant influence on the distribution of the rainfall around the lake whereas total rainfall amounts are hardly changed. Further away from the lake, the impact seems to be limited. In a deeper and wider analysis of the model results, the mechanism behind the changes is investigated. Also the effect on a single passing convective system is explored.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Satellite remote sensing systems are the only means to provide information about clouds on large scales. The geostationary satellite, Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) has onboard an imaging radiometer, the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI). SEVIRI is a 12 channel imager, with 11 channels observing the earth&#39;s full disk with a temporal resolution of 15 min and spatial resolution of 3 km at nadir, and a high resolution visible (HRV) channel. The visible channels (0.6 µm and 0.81 µm) and near infrared channel (1.6µm) of SEVIRI are being used to retrieve the cloud optical thickness (COT). The study domain is over Europe covering the region between 35°N - 70°N and 10°W - 30°E.

Temperature Sensitivity of the Antarctic Surface Mass Balance in a Regional Atmospheric Climate ModelJournal of Climate,  2002ABSTRACT the sea ice extent is studied with a regional atmospheric climate model (RACMO) using a ... more ABSTRACT the sea ice extent is studied with a regional atmospheric climate model (RACMO) using a horizontal grid spacing of 55 km. The model is driven at its lateral boundaries by the reanalyses from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. Sea ice extent and sea surface temperature are prescribed from observations. A control integration is performed for the 5-yr period 1980–84. In a 5-yr sensitivity run, the model is forced by a 2-K increase in temperature at the sea surface and at the lateral boundaries of the model domain, and a reduction in the sea ice extent. The relative humidity at the lateral boundaries is kept constant. The calculated surface mass balance of the grounded Antarctic ice is found to increase by 30% due to the 2- K warming and the retreat of the sea ice. This value is two to three times as large as previous estimates, which were based on simplified atmospheric models and on statistical relations between the surface temperature and the surface mass balance. Additional sensitivity runs show that applying the forcing throughout the atmosphere in the lateral boundary zone has a more significant effect than applying the forcing at the sea surface, especially for the interior of the ice sheet. If only an increase in the sea surface temperature or a retreat of the sea ice is prescribed, the increase in temperature and specific humidity is restricted to the lowest 2 km of the atmosphere above the ocean. Sensitivity runs with forcings in the range of 25 to 110 K indicate that the commonly used assumption stating that the surface mass balance responds in proportion to the change in continental saturation specific humidity at the inversion height is an oversimplification.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Recent progress in spatial and temporal resolution of satellite remote sensing increases the potential of such evaluation efforts. This paper presents new methodologies to compare satellite remote sensing observations of clouds and output of atmospheric models and demonstrates their usefulness for evaluation. The comparison is carried out for two MODerate resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) scenes from the BALTEX Bridge Campaigns. Both scenes are characterised by low-level clouds with a substantial amount of liquid water. Cloud cover and cloud optical thickness of five different models, LM, Méso-NH, MM5 (non-hydrostatic models), RACMO2, and RCA (regional climate models) as well as corresponding retrievals from high resolution remote sensing observations of MODIS onboard the Terra satellite form the basis of a statistical analysis to compare the data sets. With the newly introduced patchiness parameters it is possible to separate differences between the two scenes on the one hand and between the models and the satellite on the other hand. We further introduce a new approach to spatially aggregate cloud optical thickness. Generally the models overestimate cloud optical thickness which can in part be ascribed to the lack of subgrid-scale variability. However, LM underestimates the frequency of occurrence of cloud optical thickness at values around 25. Furthermore, we compare the standard operational output of the non-hydrostatic models to simulations of the same models including parameterised shallow convection. However, clear improvements in the representation of low-level clouds are not found for these models. A change of the coefficients for autoconversion in RCA shows that LWP and precipitation strongly depend on this parameter. Refined vertical resolution, implemented in RACMO2, leads to a better agreement between model and satellite but still leaves room for further improvements. In general, this study reveals deficiencies of the models in representing low-level clouds, in particular for a stratiform cloud.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
