Following Zacharakis, Pastiadis, and Reiss (2014), a pairwise dissimilarity listening test involving participants from two separate linguistic groups (Greek and English) was conducted. Subsequent multidimensional scaling analysis produced a 3D perceptual timbre space for each language. The comparison between perceptual spaces suggested that timbre perception is unaffected by native language. Additionally, comparisons between semantic and perceptual spaces revealed substantial similarities which suggest that verbal descriptions can convey a considerable amount of perceptual information. The previously determined semantic labels “auditory texture” and “luminance” featured the highest associations with perceptual dimensions for both languages. “Auditory mass” failed to show any strong correlations. Acoustic analysis identified energy distribution of harmonic partials, spectral detail, temporal/spectrotemporal characteristics and the fundamental frequency as the most salient acoustic correlates of perceptual dimensions.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersAn interlanguage unification of musical timbre: bridging semantic, perceptual and acoustic dimensionsAsteris Zacharakis, Konstantinos PastiadisThe current study expands our previous work on interlanguage musical timbre semantics by examining the relationship between semantics and perception of timbre.

In two separate experiments, native Greek and English speaking participants were asked to describe 23 musical instrument tones of variable pitch using a predefined vocabulary of 30 adjectives. The common experimental protocol facilitated the investigation of the influence of language on musical timbre semantics by allowing for direct comparisons between linguistic groups. Data reduction techniques applied to the data of each group revealed three salient semantic dimen- sions that shared common conceptual properties between linguistic groups namely: luminance, texture, and mass. The results supported universality of timbre semantics. A correlation analysis between physical characteristics and semantic dimensions associated: i) texture with the energy distribution of harmonic partials, ii) thickness (a term related to either mass or luminance) and brilliance with inharmonicity and spectral centroid variation, and iii) F0 with mass or luminance depending on the linguistic group.Download Free PDFView PDFMusic Perception: An Interdisciplinary JournalAn Interlanguage Unification of Musical Timbre2015 • Asteris Zacharakis, Konstantinos PastiadisDownload Free PDFView PDFAN INVESTIGATION OF MUSICAL TIMBRE: UNCOVERING SALIENT SEMANTIC DESCRIPTORS AND PERCEPTUAL DIMENSIONSAsteris Zacharakis, Joshua D Reiss, Konstantinos Pastiadis, Georgios PapadelisDownload Free PDFView PDFIdentifying the Perceptual Dimensions of Musical Instrument Timbre2018 • Lindsey ReymoreDifferent musical instruments do not simply exhibit different musical timbres; they also evoke different phenomenological experiences, or "musical instrument qualia." Informal descriptions of instrument sounds seem to employ stereotypical characterizations, such as "airy" for a flute or "heavy" for a tuba. Previous research has sought to identify dimensions of timbre through listener judgments of paired comparisons (Grey, 1977, Kendall et al., 1999). Investigations into the semantic dimensions of timbre demonstrate that a number of descriptive terms map consistently onto particular acoustic correlates of timbre (e.g. Zacharkakis, Pastiadis, & Reiss, 2014). This three-part project aims to develop a model of the dimensions of musical instrument qualia. Results of the first two studies are reported here. In the first study, interviews were conducted with professional and semi-professional musicians in which they were asked to open-endedly describe the sounds of different musical instruments. Responses were subjected to content analysis using a pile-sort method, yielding an initial list of categories of musical instrument qualia. To test the reliability and usefulness of the dimensions yielded from the first study, the second study asked participants to rate musical instrument sounds according to the pile-sorted categories. Principal components analysis suggests ways in which categories with significant overlapping variance can be collapsed; preliminary results of this analysis are presented here. In the last stage of the study (not reported here), participants will rate an expanded number of instruments according to each of the dimensions in the final PCA model; these results will then be used to generate perceptual profiles for the most common Western musical instruments.Download Free PDFView PDFOxford Handbooks OnlineThe Perception of Musical Timbre2015 • Ian CrossDownload Free PDFView PDFAnalysis of Musical Timbre Semantics through Metric and Non-Metric Data Reduction TechniquesKonstantinos Pastiadis, Asteris Zacharakis, Georgios PapadelisDownload Free PDFView PDFThe Journal of the Acoustical Society of AmericaAcoustic structure of the five perceptual dimensions of timbre in orchestral instrument tones2013 • Liberty  Hamilton, Frédéric TheunissenDownload Free PDFView PDFMusic Perception: An Interdisciplinary JournalEffect of Enculturation on the Semantic and Acoustic Correlates of Polyphonic Timbre2012 • vinoo alluripolyphonic timbre perception was investigated in a cross-cultural context wherein Indian and Western nonmusicians rated short Indian and Western popular music excerpts (1.5 s, n = 200) on eight bipolar scales. Intrinsic dimensionality estimation revealed a higher number of perceptual dimensions in the timbre space for music from one&#39;s own culture. Factor analyses of Indian and Western participants&#39; ratings resulted in highly similar factor solutions. The acoustic features that predicted the perceptual dimensions were similar across the two participant groups. Furthermore, both the perceptual dimensions and their acoustic correlates matched closely with the results of a previous study performed using Western musicians as participants. Regression analyses revealed relatively well performing models for the perceptual dimensions. The models displayed relatively high cross-validation performance. The findings suggest the presence of universal patterns in polyphonic timbre percept...Download Free PDFView PDFThe perception of musical timbre1 CHAPTER 7Bruno L.
