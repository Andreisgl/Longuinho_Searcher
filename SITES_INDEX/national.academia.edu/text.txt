In addition, the subtext of a Freudian approach to sexuality and a Marxian dissatisfaction with the material world of fin-de-siecle France position him as akin to numerous future artists and authors who espoused a Surrealist aesthetic and ethos.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

"Comedy Is Tragedy + Time": Humor and Trauma in LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL (1998)Florida State University Film and Literature conference,  2006There is a famous quotation that has been variously attributed to Mark Twain, Lenny Bruce, Carol ... more There is a famous quotation that has been variously attributed to Mark Twain, Lenny Bruce, Carol Burnett, Steve Allen, Larry Gelbart, Mel Brooks, and a fictional character played by Alan Alda in Woody Allen's Crimes and Misdemeanors (1989). That quote is "Comedy is Tragedy + Time." Can we successfully explore this old cliché to see if it has any use-value in terms of trauma and terror? Can we (and should we) find humor in excruciating personal, national, and global catastrophes? What is the ultimate role of comedy in our lives and in our cinemas-i.e., is film comedy a positive force that provides a coping mechanism for the eternal suffering of the human species or is it just another "opiate of the masses" that conceals the true nature of reality from our eyes? These are, of course, big questions-and the jury may still be out, unless the response is "Yes, it's both!" or "It depends on the circumstances." Perhaps interrogating the issues of trauma and terror from the context of comedy will help us find a solution to a conundrum that many scholars thought had been settled, at least to their satisfaction, many years ago. This study examines these questions in connection with Roberto Benigni's Academy Award-winning  LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL (1998)Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In addition to these socio-thematic questions, the film's aesthetic derives from a variety of intertextual sources: classic film noir (albeit in color), John Cassavetes's cinéma-vérité "realism"; Michael Powell's Technicolor expressionism; the modernist European art cinema of Federico Fellini, Michelangelo Antonioni, and Jean-Luc Godard; and, of course, John Ford's The Searchers.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

ABSTRACT of "Michelangelo Antonioni: Ambiguity in the Modernist Cinema"Michelangelo Antonioni: Ambiguity in the Modernist Cinema,  2019Most of the scholarly literature on the cinema of Michelangelo Antonioni focuses on the director'... more Most of the scholarly literature on the cinema of Michelangelo Antonioni focuses on the director's distinctive film style. Many studies mention his relationship to various modern art movements and the thematic ambiguity of his work, but few position Antonioni's later films in their modernist context and within the contemporary phenomenon of ambiguity.This study attempts to situate Antonioni within the larger, contextualizing discourse of modernism and its ''problematics of language." The contemporary epistēme changes and is changed by the cultural predicament of modern times. For one, narrative forms change in all the arts, becoming more "open." An analysis of "the narrative contract"—the complex relationships between the artistic text and its author, characters, and spectators—is a precondition for understanding the anti­teleological structure of modern art and cinema.For another, each of the "subjectivities" of the narrative contract—authors, characters, reader/spectators—has taken on distinctive and ambiguous forms in contemporary art, literature, and cinema. Modern texts alternate between highly intrusive and self-effacing authors, sometimes within the same work. Characters are often explored in depth yet remain psychological ciphers who can only be understood through "subjective correlatives. " Under these conditions, modern recipients of artistic communication become more active readers, more alive to the play of contradictions in the open text.These modernist paradigms of textual structuration are explored in interdisciplinary fashion to better understand Antonioni's specific relationship to realism and modernism, the dominant rhetorical rubrics of the modern epoch. These same paradigms are used to define the textual nature of the director's ambiguity.Finally, the ideological implications of modernism, ambiguity, and the later films of Antonioni are discussed from a Marxist perspective. These conclusions should have important ramifications not only for how Antonioni's films are viewed and understood, but how cinema research, criticism, and theory are conducted. The self-reflexive tendencies of modern art and cinema necessitate a more self-conscious criticism that challenges the assumptions of prior methodologies.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

New York: Continuum, 2006, 246 pp. As in so many areas of life and cinema, there is good news and bad news. The good news is that two scholarly books devoted to Steven Spielberg are out. The bad news is that only one of them-Lester D. Friedman&#39;s Citizen Spielberg- lives up to its stated mission: to give Spielberg his rightful place in film history. Friedman claims to have written the first complete analysis of Spielberg&#39;s cinema, and he does so from a generally laudatory perspective. Although I have a few respectful quibbles with Friedman&#39;s analyses of individual movies, I admire his intellectual courage in bucking the tide of anti-Spielberg invective. In doing so, he takes on almost the entire field of academic film studies, including this reviewer. Friedman strives to &quot;engage in ...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Seidelman replied, &quot;Don&#39;t take any film theory classes.&quot; This anecdote reflects the attitude of many industry professionals, filmmakers, students, and even some film production professors, who do not recognize the valuable nexus between motion picture theory and practice. Although it is no doubt true that much of classical and (especially) contemporary film theory is rather abstruse, Lev Kuleshov&#39;s dictum (announced at the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Moscow Institute of Cinema) still holds true today:Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Old Vino in New Bottles?: The Sopranos and Long-Form NarrativeQuarterly Review of Film and VideoSeveral decades ago, a number of media theoreticians predicted the dawning of a new Media Age. On... more Several decades ago, a number of media theoreticians predicted the dawning of a new Media Age. One of those thinkers, Marshall McLuhan, even punned on this idea in the title of his classic volume, The Medium Is the Massage (Mass Age? Message? Massage?). French theorists also prophesied a “society of the spectacle” (Guy Debord) or a “culture of the simulacrum” (Jean Baudrillard). In many ways, our contemporary media universe has fulfilled these predictions, especially with reference to changing narrative structures and evolving “delivery systems.” In recent years, a bevy of blogs, journal articles, and scholarly essays are proclaiming the arrival of new “long-form narratives” that seem to have emerged from Zeus’s head like Athena (Figures 1–2), only to appear on premium cable (and even basic cable channels). Of course, Athena was the goddess of wisdom and a sponsor of the arts, but her birth is still a myth—as is the idea that long-form narratives are new to either our big or small screens. To some, the Old Testament may also be a myth but, as the Bible says: “That which has been is what will be / That which is done is what will be done / And there is nothing new under the sun” (Ecclesiastes 1:9). The Bible may exaggerate when it suggests there is “nothing new under the sun.” So, how can we categorize, characterize, and distinguish between what is “the next new thing” and what is “old vino in new bottles”? As exemplars, consider some ancient “long-form” texts, such as epic poetry (The Odyssey, The Iliad, The Aeneid, and The Divine Comedy); the 19th-century novel; The Godfather trilogy; and some more recent examples such as nighttime soap operas and dramas such as The Good Wife, Mad Men, and The Sopranos (1999–2007). However, before embarking on an investigation of the latter series’ approach to the long-form, it must be understood that not all long-running television series are long-form narratives—if so, the series I Love Lucy and M A S H would be considered long-form. True, Lucy and Ricky, as well as Hawkeye and Hot Lips, probably had subtle character “arcs” that developed over many years; however, the main focus, for both the creative team and the audience, was on the protagonists’ growth and development within each episode, not across the years. In short, for the most part, television shows have consisted of either stand-alone episodes that recount full-Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
