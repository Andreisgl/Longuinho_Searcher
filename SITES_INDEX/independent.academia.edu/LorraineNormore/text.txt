If teachers are to achieve these goals, they must become knowledgeable about the latest research-based information on how to teach effectively. However, we know little, in general, about the information seeking behaviors of practicing teachers or about the uses to which they would put the information they seek. This focus group study explores the information needs expressed by a group of early literacy teachers. Both traditional and non-traditional sources are identified to meet those needs and insight provided into the context of use.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

These user archetypes show differences in the information sources sought, information behaviors shown, and in the information products generated by researchers, environmental educators, and members of the public involved in the environmental movement.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The dominant visualization model, its origins and issues raised by its use, are explored in this paper. An alternate model based on a systematic classification system is proposed and an application based on this model is described. INTRODUCTION Scientific data visualization was developed to explore ways to aggregate and summarize large quantities of numbers to aid data interpretation. Graphic representations were sought because, as Tufte [1] says, “of all methods for analyzing and communicating statistical information, well-designed data graphics are usually the simplest and at the same time the most powerful” (Introduction). In scientific fields, the inherent data metric underlying the visualization is often apparent. For quantitative data, frequency of occurrence of a dependent variabl...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Since class credit is often associated with the extent to which students participate in class discussions, it is of practical as well as theoretical importance that we gather data about this effect. This study provides a controlled look at class participation rates in a single class in which individual students had the opportunity to participate in both modes. It interprets the results in the light of theories concerning forms of communication apprehension and factors related to the nature of the individual (&quot;trait&quot;) rather than a function of media context (&quot;state&quot;).Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This article reports on some of the issues raised, discusses the activities associated with this project and points out differences in the perceptions of the tasks seen as relevant to this role by a human factors professional and by systems development staff.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This finding corroborates those of previous experiments, in which the induction of uncertainty through prior guessing facilitated incidental paired-associate learning of words. Further experiments with 53 male and 47 female Ss show the effect to be absent when blurred pictures were dissociated from uncertainty or when clear pictures did not relieve uncertainty. The effect occurred, whether or not S knew, on seeing a blurred picture, that the corresponding clear picture would follow. Explanations in terms of reinforcement through reduction of epistemic curiosity and in terms of attention are discussed.
