Defining sustainable architecture is a notoriously difficult proposition. Ambitious claims abound, demanding a critical distance, but equally important and necessary self-criticisms are heard. Edward Mazria (2013) founder of the Architecture 2030 Challenge, argues that &quot; life depends on design. &quot; Whilst the building sector as a whole, a major emitter of greenhouse gases, is currently making a significant negative impact on the natural environment, it can also be a solution to climate change.

It is argued that since sustainable architecture is only dealing with certain aspects of nature, deemed desirable by people, it cannot claim that it is a true ecological solution due to the fact that it leaves many of nature’s so called “undesirable” manifestations untreated and unprovided for. Thus in this paper I attempt to analyze the trends and shifts in the relationship of man and nature from Renaissance up to Modernity, evaluate the current definition of sustainability and its application in 1st, 2nd and 3rd world countries, introduce the relatively new concept of subnatures and finally superimpose the ideas of subnature with the ideology of sustainability. In doing so it is hoped that this paper will provide the initial questions and ideas that will generate a basis upon which further research and development of the core ideas of sustainability and subnatures will be carried out, in order to culminate into the creation of architecture that takes into account the entirety of nature as well as the human needs and aspirations.Download Free PDFView PDFEVELYN GYASITHE IMPORTANCE OF SUSTAINABILITY IN ARCHITECTURE AND WHAT MAKES ARCHITECTURE SUSTAINABLE2022 • Evelyn Gyasisustainability in architecture is very important now and for the generations ahead of us. If we are hoping for a better ecosystem, free of non-toxic gases, and materials in our communities worldwide. Then we need to consciously consider and imbibe the principles of sustainability in our lifestyles and our built environment starting from the young ones. I’ve observed how The building industry is very much aware that they are also culprits of ecological disruptions, hence the promotion of extensive research, workshops, projects, and standard guides that have been established in the area of sustainability in architecture. Education on sustainability in architecture is readily available and reliable for all to follow such as information about easy sourcing of eco-friendly materials; renewable resources, energy efficiency, and renewable energy are now available and easy to understandDownload Free PDFView PDFSustainable Architecture: Utopia or Feasible Reality?Zaheer AllamDownload Free PDFView PDFPaper delivered at Shaping the Sustainable Millennium …The Limits of 'Sustainable Architecture'2000 • Anne-Marie WillisDownload Free PDFView PDFThe Journal of ArchitectureFields of sustainable architecture2008 • Kim DoveyDownload Free PDFView PDFArchitecture Now: A History of Sustainable Architecture2019 • Meg VickeryDownload Free PDFView PDFReinterpreting Sustainable Architecture: The Place of Technologyjorge perillaDownload Free PDFView PDFArchitectural Design Principles and Processes for Sustainability: Towards a Typology of Sustainable Building Design, David Grierson and Carolyn Moultrie, 2011David GriersonDownload Free PDFView PDFIdeology of Sustainable Architecture: A Critique2019 • Onur Lami YalmanThe general consensus on Sustainable Architecture is that, it is the cure for the ecological crisis. However, neither sustainability, nor architecture exists in a vacuum, free of any connection to political struggle. Therefore, a thorough research must be conducted in order to uncover the roots of sustainability, and its relations to architecture. The objective of this thesis is to form a critique of sustainable architecture, and propose an emancipatory ecological architectural praxis. Current understanding of nature can be defined as a bourgeois ideology shaped by Kantian dualism, directly influencing the mainstream definition of ‘Sustainable Development’ in the Brundtland Report, released in 1987. This ideology of nature brings with it a misguided sense of development which locates technology at its core. The belief that technology will solve all of the world’s problems is a mere treatment of the symptom, whereas the real disease remains untouched. The thesis analyses the problem of sustainability from three distinct points of view: Marxist, Eco-Socialist and Green Capitalist perspectives. As a result of this analysis, the thesis aims to propose a radical and holistic approach to sustainable architecture, which is essential in forming a sustainable architectural praxis.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
