Evidence of effective interventions is rather limited and fragmented. We need to identify innovative ways to improve access to PHC for vulnerable populations, and to clarify which elements of health systems, organisations or services (supply-side dimensions of access) and abilities of patients or populations (demand-side dimensions of access) need to be strengthened to achieve transformative change. The work reported here was conducted as part of IMPACT (Innovative Models Promoting Access-to-Care Transformation), a 5-year Canadian-Australian research program aiming to identify, implement and trial best practice interventions to improve access to PHC for vulnerable populations. We undertook an environmental scan as a broad screening approach to identify the breadth of current innovations from the field.

This article illuminates some broad trends in the health status of people with mental illnesses, canvasses important features of inequalities suffered by people with mental illnesses, and suggests strategies for systemic reform. Most reform recommendations I offer are in the area of healthcare organization leadership and management. Other key reforms will likely be legislative, regulatory, and insurance-related. Social and cultural reforms in organizational practices and structures will also be critical.Save to LibraryDownloadby International Journal of Health Policy and Management IJHPM•  3  Health Equity, Equity in Health Care, Theories and Concepts in Health and DevelopmentEliminating Health Care Disparities: Why and HowSave to LibraryDownloadby Nathan (Andy) Bostick•  3  Health Equity, Data Collection, Health Care DispartiesDefining equity in healthSave to LibraryDownloadby Paula Braveman•  18  Sociology, Human Geography, Bioethics, Human RightsThe future of health governance needs youth voices at the forefrontToday’s children and young people are growing up in a time of radical digital transformation, rapidly changing information ecosystems, widespread integration of digital technologies, and other social, political, and environmental shifts.... moreToday’s children and young people are growing up in a time of radical digital transformation, rapidly changing information ecosystems, widespread integration of digital technologies, and other social, political, and environmental shifts.

The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between systemic racism generally, and residential segregation in particular, and racial/ethnic disparities in deaths due to COVID-19.Methods: To assess racial disparities in COVID-19 and systemic racism in US states, we calculated descriptive statistics and bivariate Pearson correlations. Using data on deaths through December 2020, we developed a weighted logistic mixed model to assess whether state-level systemic racism generally and residential segregation, in particular, predicted the probability of COVID-19 deaths among Americans, con­sidering key sociodemographic factors.Results: Residential segregation is a stronger predictor of COVID-19 deaths among Black Americans, as compared to systemic racism more generally. Looking at the interac­tion between residential segregation and COVID-19 death rates by race, residential segregation is associated with negative outcomes for Black and White Americans, but disproportionately impacts Black state residents (P<.001), who have 2.14 times higher odds of dying from COVID-19 when residential segregation is increased.Conclusion: To understand and address disparities in infectious disease, researchers and public health practitioners should ac­knowledge how different forms of systemic racism shape health outcomes in the United States. More attention should be given to the mechanisms by which infectious disease pandemics exacerbate health disparities in areas of high residential segregation and should inform more targeted health poli­cies. Such policy changes stand to make all American communities more resilient in the face of new and emerging infec­tious diseases.Save to LibraryDownloadby Berkeley Franz and +1Ben Parker•  8  Epidemiology, Segregation, Race and Racism, Health DisparitiesInteractive social media interventions to promote health equity: an overview of reviewsSocial media use has been increasing in public health and health promotion because it can remove geographic and physical access barriers.

However, these interventions also have the potential to increase health inequities for people who do not have access to or do not use social media. In this paper, we aim to assess the effects of interactive social media interventions on health outcomes, behaviour change and health equity. We conducted a rapid response overview of systematic reviews. We used a sensitive search strategy to identify systematic reviews and included those that focussed on interventions allowing two-way interaction such as discussion forums, social networks (e.g. Facebook and Twitter), blogging, applications linked to online communities and media sharing. Eleven systematic reviews met our inclusion criteria.

In their daily lives, minorities experience situations of exclusion, marginality and discrimination that make them particularly vulnerable to healthproblems. In this paper we primarily focus on indigenous peoples. Rates of morbidity and mortality above national levels, hunger, undernutrition,occupational hazards and social violence are some of the multiple health-disease outcomes that derive from the persistence of inequalities. It is important that conditions are created in order to revert the current situation of demographic and epidemiological “invisibility”faced by indigenous peoples in Brazil, which in part stem from the absence of information about them in national databases. This will allowfor a better understanding of the genesis, determinants and ways of reproduction of health inequalities in Brazil, thus potentiallyinforming political actions and fostering interventions.Save to LibraryDownloadby Carlos E .

Barriers to Meeting Community Needs in New York State during COVID-19: Results From a Pilot Survey of Nongovernmental Population and Community Health Professionals. Health Promotion Practice. December 2021. doi:10.1177/15248399211065412Capacity building and training help empower the community and population health organizations to partner with local health departments and collaboratively design multisectoral interventions that account for the complexity of public health and health promotion challenges in the era of COVID-19 and beyond. Ideally, training programs should be informed by an understanding of the needs and priorities of the professionals for whom they are intended. This brief report focuses on the results of a pilot online survey conducted as part of a larger pilot study by the New York State Association of County Health Officials and the Region 2 Public Health Training Center among population and community health professionals (n = 27) from four counties in New York State during the COVID-19 pandemic. Survey participants included a diverse group of staff members from various large and small nonprofit organizations, federally qualified health centers, academic institutions, hospitals, and insurers. Survey findings provide preliminary insights into the extent to which these organizations have been involved in the COVID-19 response in partnership with LHDs, barriers they faced in responding to the needs of the populations they serve and adjusting their work routines/operations to COVID-19 guidelines, and their top emerging organizational and training needs. Lessons learned from conducting an online survey during a public health emergency and implications for future training interventions for population and community health professionals are also discussed within the context of promoting multisectoral collaboration with local health departments, solving complex public health problems, and advancing health equity.Save to LibraryDownloadby Renata Schiavo and +2Mayela AranaSarah Ravenhall•  11  Health Promotion, Training and Development, Population Health, Community HealthObesity Literacy and Culture among African American Women in FloridaSave to LibraryDownloadby quentin boston•  20  Mixed Methods, Obesity, Health Literacy, Cultural CompetencyEquity-Focused Health Impact Assessment: A Tool to Assist Policy Makers In Addressing Health InequalitiesIn Australasia (Australia and New Zealand) the use of health impact assessment (HIA) as a tool for improved policy development is comparatively new.

Patient X works two jobs to provide for her five children, maintain her one-bedroom apartment, and save up money for her liver transplant. She contracted hepatitis B which has ultimately caused the formation of hepatic tumors. She does not have enough money to pay for a liver transplant, and her wait time on the national waitlist for her region is over a year. Meanwhile, her liver function is drastically decreasing with every day that passes.Patient Y is a successful business owner with a beautiful family of her own. She contracted a rare autoimmune disease that detrimentally impacts her liver function. Although she was taking medication to keep her healthy for a while, she suddenly felt a sharp pain one day, and the doctors found that she might need a liver transplant very soon. Because her region had a high demand for liver transplants, her doctors gave her the option to get listed in a less liver-demanding area given that she had the economic stability necessary to do so. In just 10 days of moving to this area, a liver was finally available for her, and her surgery would take place as soon as she wanted.Unfortunately, there are a plethora of potential organ recipients stuck in Patient X’s position. Although there is a national database, which means there is a wait time for all organ recipients, loopholes that enable affluent patients to travel to regions with shorter wait times still exist. There are also patients with time-dependent diseases that simply cannot wait over a year to finally get an organtransplant and end up dying. This is thereason some have proposed an “organ market” where patients who need an organ urgently can buy it without having to wait so long. This “market” does not sit well with too many people and is already illegal in the United States; people believe it could put the more vulnerable and less affluent part of the population at risk of even longer wait times for an organ transplant. Perhaps, there is a way to ensure equal access to organ transplants with lower wait times that will benefit the most people- but what would that look like?Save to LibraryDownloadby Jocelyne Maestro•  5  Health Sciences, Health Equity, Organ Donation and Transplantation, Health and Social CarePromoting health equity in conflict-affected fragile statesSave to LibraryDownloadby Egbert Sondorp•  19  Sociology, Anthropology, Health Promotion, Community-Based Mental Health ServicesFinanciamento do SUS: abrindo a caixa-pretaA multiplicidade de eventos e entidades envolvidos no processo multinível do financiamento da saúde pública tem criado obstáculos ao conhecimento das micro e macro realidades envolvidas.

However, what is to be measured in the assessment of health equity and how inequities in health ought to be redressed are among the pressing questions that must be answered if health equity is to serve as a meaningful and consistent ethical guide for measurement and intervention in public health. In this article I argue that the concept of health equity, in the form it is predominantly found in public health, suffers from normative indeterminacy and is therefore unlikely to provide actionable normative guidance to public health policy-makers, practitioners and researchers. I argue that the concept of health equity, as it is commonly defined in public health, ultimately rests upon assumptions of a more fundamental, yet tacit, conception of justice to do its normative work. In this vein, I expand upon a critique of Margaret Whitehead’s (1992) oft-cited definition of health equity made by James Wilson (2011) to raise additional reasons not explored by Wilson, or others, as to why Whitehead’s definition remains inadequate in providing normative guidance to policy-makers, practitioners and researchers in public health.Save to LibraryDownloadby Maxwell J Smith•  10  Bioethics, Public Health Ethics, Public Health Policy, Health JusticeSchools of public health in low and middle-income countries: an imperative investment for improving the health of populations?Save to LibraryDownloadby Fauziah Rabbani•  10  Poverty, Primary Health Care, Developing Countries, Health EquityHenk ten Have: Global bioethics: an introductionSave to LibraryDownloadby Daniel T Kim•  3  Global Health, Health Equity, Global EthicsIndigenous Natural and First Law in Planetary HealthIndigenous Peoples associate their own laws with the laws of the natural world, which are formally known as or translated as Natural or First Law.

These laws come from the Creator and the Land through our ancestral stories and therefore, they are sacred. All aspects of life and existence depend on living and following these natural First Laws. Since colonization, Indigenous Peoples’ Natural Laws have been forcibly replaced by modern-day laws that do not take into account the sacred relationship between the Earth and all of her inhabitants. The force of societies who live outside of Natural Law has ensured the modern-day consequences of not living in balance with nature. Pandemics and global environmental change, including climate change, are all consequences of not following the Natural Laws that are encapsulated by the interconnected nature of the universe.

Drawing on secondary sources of data, the aim of this article is to generate a better understanding of the historical Research & Development dynamics that have contributed to shape today's medical innovation ecosystem. We describe key technological achievements along three historical periods – the 1950s, the 1980s and the 2000s – and situate them within their broader political, social, cultural and economic contexts. Our analyses bring forward self-reinforcing dynamics between technology, medical specialization , individualization of disease and the concentration of resources in academic teaching centres. We argue that the way medical innovation has been financed, designed and commercialized since the 1950s has engendered path dependency, which exacerbates the sustainability challenges healthcare systems are now facing. We conclude on the need for innovation design principles that could protect the sustainability of healthcare systems.Save to LibraryDownloadby Pascale Lehoux and +2Federico RoncaroloHudson P Silva•  4  Health Equity, Health Technology, Medical devices, SustainabilityHistorical Insights on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), the 1918 Influenza Pandemic, and Racial Disparities: Illuminating a Path ForwardThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is exacting a disproportionate toll on ethnic minority communities and magnifying existing disparities in health care access and treatment.

To understand this crisis, physicians and public health researchers have searched history for insights, especially from a great outbreak approximately a century ago: the 1918 influenza pandemic. However, of the accounts examining the 1918 influenza pandemic and COVID-19, only a notable few discuss race. Yet, a rich, broader scholarship on race and epidemic disease as a “sampling device for social analysis” exists. This commentary examines the historical arc of the 1918 influenza pandemic, focusing on black Americans and showing the complex and sometimes surprising ways it operated, triggering particular responses both within a minority community and in wider racial, sociopolitical, and public health structures. This analysis reveals that critical structural inequities and health care gaps have historically contributed to and continue to compound disparate health outcomes among communities of color. Shifting from this context to the present, this article frames a discussion of racial health disparities through a resilience approach rather than a deficit approach and offers a blueprint for approaching the COVID-19 crisis and its afterlives through the lens of health equity.Save to LibraryDownloadby Lakshmi Krishnan and +1Michelle Ogunwole•  5  History of Medicine, History of Public Health, Medical Humanities, Health EquityThe reform of the medical welfare system and health equity for the elderly in China: a study in ZhejiangHealth equity is the basic theory of universal health insurance and the objective of reform of the medical welfare system.

Based on health equity theory with the perspective of giving priority to disadvantaged groups, this article takes Zhejiang province as an example and adopts a mixed-method approach to explore the effects of the reform of the medical welfare system on health equity for older people. The structural equation model (SEM)-based nonrecursive path analysis demonstrates an improvement of health equity for insured elders of the Basic Medical Insurance for Employees (BMIE) and the Urban Basic Medical Insurance for Residents (UBMIR) as a result of an increased utilization of healthcare. However, there is little difference in terms of the utilization of healthcare and health outcomes between old people insured by the New Rural Cooperative Medical System (NRCMS) and those without medical insurance. This results from the low-level benefits of the insurance policy and defective policy design. A qualitative analysis further discovers the insufficient protection of health equity for several types of vulnerable aged groups in the process of healthcare delivery. Finally, this study advocates the perspective of health equity for vulnerable groups, a transition from emphasizing opportunity equity to stressing outcome equity, and the construction of universal health insurance and long-term care system for the disabled elderly.Save to LibraryDownloadby Hung WONG•  6  Structural Equation Modeling, Health Outcomes, China, Health EquityApplying an equity lens to interventions: using PROGRESS ensures consideration of socially stratifying factors to illuminate inequities in healthSave to LibraryDownloadby Jennifer Petkovic•  9  Research Design, Clinical Epidemiology, Health Equity, HumansA glossary of policy frameworks: the many forms of ‘universalism’ and policy ‘targeting’The recognition that certain characteristics (such as poverty, disadvantage or membership of marginalised social or cultural groups) can make individuals more susceptible to illness has reignited interest in how to combine universal... moreThe recognition that certain characteristics (such aspoverty, disadvantage or membership of marginalisedsocial or cultural groups) can make individuals moresusceptible to illness has reignited interest in how tocombine universal programmes and policies with onestargeted at specific groups.

The objective of this systematic scoping review is to synthesize information from the published literature on the methods/approaches, findings, and scope for research and interventions on the retail food sector servicing Indigenous Peoples in high-income countries. A structured literature search in two major international databases yielded 139 relevant peer-reviewed articles from nine countries. Most research was conducted in Oceania and North America, and in rural and remote regions. Several convergent issues were identified across global regions including limited grocery store availability/access, heightened exposure to unhealthy food environments, inadequate market food supplies (i.e., high prices, limited availability, and poor quality), and common underlying structural factors including socioeconomic inequality and colonialism. A list of actions that can modify the nature and structure of retailing systems to enhance the availability, accessibility, and quality of healthful foods is identified. While continuing to (re)align research with community priorities, international collaboration may foster enhanced opportunities to strengthen the evidence base for policy and practice and contribute to the amelioration of diet quality and health at the population level.Save to LibraryDownloadby Matthew Little and +2Tad LemieuxSonia Wesche•  8  Obesity, Health Equity, Indigenous Peoples, Food supplyContinuing nursing education policy in China and its impact on health equitySave to LibraryDownloadby Lily Xiao•  17  Critical Theory, Nursing, Nurse Education, Resource AllocationCommunity nutrition programs, globalization and sustainable developmentOn an international scale, the last seventy-five years have been a period of deep social, economic and political transformation for the developing countries.

They have been especially influenced by the international phenomenon of globalization, the benefits of which have been unequally distributed among countries. In this context, the strategies used to improve the general nutritional health of the population of developing countries include broad approaches integrating nutritional interventions in a context of sustainable community development, while valuing the existing relations between fields as diverse as agriculture, education, sociology, economy, health, environment, hygiene and nutrition. The community nutrition programmes are emblematic of these initiatives. Nevertheless, in spite of the increasing evidence of the potential possibilities offered by these programmes to improve the nutritional status and contribute to the development and the self-sufficiency of the community, their success is relatively limited, due to the inappropriate planning, implementation and evaluation of the programmes. In the present article, I attempt to emphasie the importance of community participation of the population of developing countries in the community nutrition programmes within the context of globalization. This process is not only an ethical imperative, but a pragmatic one. It is a crucial step in the process of liberation, democratization and equality that will lead to true sustainable development.Save to LibraryDownloadby José Carlos  Suárez-Herrera•  6  Globalization, Sustainable Development, Global Health, Health EquityPatient-Centered Communication: A Useful Clinical ReviewPatient-centered communication is essential because of the 5 E's: ethics, effectiveness, efficiency, emotions, and equity.Save to LibraryDownloadby Zackary Berger•  11  Ethics, Communication, Health Care, Health DisparitiesBuilding Community-Campus Partnerships to Prevent Infant Mortality: Lessons Learned from Building Capacity in Four US CitiesInfant mortality rate (IMR) is an important indicator of progress toward health equity and socioeconomic development.

Concerns over the environment and what we now call the ‘social determinants of health’ were prominent in 1986. But the acceleration of ecological crises and economic inequalities since then, in a more complex and multi-polar world, pose dramatically new challenges for those committed to the original vision of the Charter. Can the 2015 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), agreed to by all the world’s governments, offer a new advocacy and programmatic platform for a renewal of health promotion’s founding ethos? Critiqued from both the right and the left for, respectively, their aspirational idealism and lack of political analysis, the SDGs are an imperfect but still compelling normative statement of how much of the world thinks the world should look like. Many of the goals and targets provide signals for what we need to achieve, even if there remains a critical lacuna in articulating how this is to be done. The fundamental flaw in the SDGs is the implicit assumption that the same economic system, and its still-present neoliberal governing rules, that have created or accelerated our present era of rampaging inequality and environmental peril can somehow be harnessed to engineer the reverse. This flaw is not irrevocable, however, if health promoters – practitioners, researchers, advocates – focus their efforts on a few key SDGs that, with some additional critique, form a basic blueprint for a system of national and global regulation of capitalism (or even its transformation) that is desperately needed for social and ecological survival into the 22nd century. Whether or not these efforts succeed is a future unknown; but that the efforts are made is a present urgency.Save to LibraryDownloadby International Journal of Health Policy and Management IJHPM•Health EquitySyndemic Vulnerability and the Right to Health (The Lancet)Willen, Sarah S., Michael Knipper, César E Abadía-Barrero, & Nadav Davidovitch. 2017.

"Syndemic vulnerability and the right to health." The Lancet 389(10072):964-977Investigators working both in syndemics, a field of applied health research with roots in medical anthropology, and in the field of health and human rights recognise that upstream social, political, and structural determinants contribute more to health inequities than do biological factors or personal choices. Syndemics investigates synergistic, often deleterious interactions among comorbid health conditions, especially under circumstances of structural and political adversity. Health and human rights research draws on international law to argue that all people deserve access not only to health care, but also to the underlying determinants of good health. Taking the urgent matter of migrant health as an empirical focus, we juxtapose the fields of syndemics and health and human rights, identify their complementarities, and advocate for a combined approach. By melding insights from these fields, the combined syndemics/health and human rights approach advanced here can provide clinicians and other key stakeholders with concrete insights, tools, and strategies to tackle the health inequities that affect migrants and other vulnerable groups by: (1) mapping the effect of social, political, and structural determinants on health; (2) identifying opportunities for upstream intervention; and (3) working collaboratively to tackle the structures, institutions, and processes that cause and exacerbate health inequities. Undergirding this approach is an egalitarian interpretation of the right to health that differs from narrow legalistic and individual interpretations by insisting that all people are equal in worth and, as a result, equally deserving of protection from syndemic vulnerability.Save to LibraryDownloadby Sarah S Willen•  22  Medical Anthropology, Human Rights, Social Justice, Critical Medical AnthropologySustainable Development and Electrification of TransitThe goal of Sustainable Development Electrification of Transit is to contribute to Canada’s capacity for investment, implementation, and assessment of Zero Electric Buses (ZEB).

A sustainable transportation system is one that is safe, affordable, accessible, efficient and resilient, and that contributes minimal emissions of carbon and other pollutants.  The adoption of Zero-Emissions Bus (ZEB) buses fits squarely within a sustainable transit electrification strategy (STES). ZEB transit is identified by all levels of government in Canada and transit authorities as a critical step in meeting clean growth goals and zero-emissions targets. ZEB includes transit infrastructure, battery (BEB) and hydrogen (FCEB) as well as hybrid diesel buses across Canada. The research team analyzed Canadian and international literature, governmental, academic and industry data sources, and sought and characterized analytics tools that could support analysis and implementation of ZEB. These sources were stored in searchable databases and analyzed according to sub-themes relevant to Transportation Systems, Environmental, Economic, Social (including Equity and Health), ZEB and Analytic Technology categories. Data collection methods and types as well as equity considerations (GBA+) were considered for all sources. Stakeholder interviews and a workshop supplemented secondary source analysis. Researchers deployed a thematic analytics tool to derive key themes in literature and interviews. If achieved, impacts are far-reaching: reduction of emissions and particulates, improved quality of urban life through less pollution and noise, improved health of residents, more equitable and affordable reach and choice of transit, industry growth, and green job creation. Secondary benefits include densification and cost reduction of pollution-induced disease for the healthcare system.Save to LibraryDownloadby Sara Diamond•  7  Sustainable Development, Health Equity, Public transportation, Social EquityHow is Qigong Conducive to Women’s Health?The present literature review provides an overview of the benefits to women’s health gained from practising Qigong (including Tai Chi and Baduanjin), including those who suffer from breast cancer, menopausal-related problems, menstrual... moreThe present literature review provides an overview of the benefits to women’s health gained from practising Qigong (including Tai Chi and Baduanjin), including those who suffer from breast cancer, menopausal-related problems, menstrualdisorders, and a variety of physical and psychological illnesses. It analyses 48 studies (n=38 in English, n=10 in Chinese) published before 2015, involving participants aged 17-86 in Asia, Europe, and North America via quantitative, qualitative, mix-method, and trans-country projects. The analysis reveals research gaps and practical implication, in particular, diminishing health disparities and accelerating health equity due to cost effectiveness when using Qigong among less advantaged groups for preventive, remedial, and rehabilitative interventions, justifying it as a powerful method of complementary and alternative medicine.Save to LibraryDownloadby 鄭鳳姬 Fung Kei, Oasis Cheng•  14  Women's Health, Complementary and Alternative Medicine, Martial Arts, Quantitative ResearchConstructing the evidence base on the social determinants of health: A guideSave to LibraryDownloadby Josiane Bonnefoy•  2  Health Equity, HealthAboriginal Health Promotion Self Determination Project: background paperSave to LibraryDownloadby Sallie  Newell•  11  Health Promotion, Early Intervention, Evidence Based Practice, Community HealthDisparities In Human Resources: Addressing The Lack Of Diversity In The HealthSave to LibraryDownloadby Kevin Mendoza•  13  Health Equity, Public Health, Human Resource, Cultural DiversityPolicy change for the social determinants of health: the strange irrelevance of social epidemiologyThe considerable evidence base linking social conditions to population health has spurred many in public health to call for political action.

Most of these conditions fall outside the purview of health departments, meaning that advocates are increasingly calling on other government sectors to improve health. Whether levelled at the whole-of-government or individual departments these calls seek a paradigm shift in governmental goals. Paradigmatic political change is an essentially normative process – one based upon ethical, rather than empirical, reasoning. Successfully achieving political change requires that public health advocates improve their normative justification for change and reduce their reliance upon evidence-based arguments. evidence-based policy • social determinants of healthSave to LibraryDownloadby Gemma Carey•  9  Health Inequalities, Global Health, Public Health Policy, Social Determinants of HealthCulturally Responsive Services as a Path to Equity in Mental HealthcareIndigenous peoples, immigrants and refugees and racialized groups, as well as some long-established ethnic, linguistic, cultural and religious communities, experience inequities in mental health in Canadian society.

These inequities result from social structural determinants of health that are embedded in the cultural knowledge, values and attitudes of the specific group as well as those of the larger society. Culture shapes the experience and expression of mental health problems, modes of coping, pathways to care and the effectiveness of treatment and prevention, as well as the processes of resilience and recovery. Systematic attention to culture in the provision of mental health services can improve access, utilization and health outcomes.

Posteriormente, exponemos una breve revisión crítica de la eficacia de los programas de intervención nutricional vigentes en ese grupo de países, señalando las principales estrategias y tendencias actuales en materia de nutrición comunitaria así como los principios fundamentales que, a nuestro juicio, podrían ser considerados a la hora de diseñar, poner en marcha, desarrollar y evaluar toda intervención nutricional, desde una perspectiva interdisciplinaria y multisectorial.Concluimos el manuscrito desde un punto de vista global, subrayando la importancia de establecer vínculos entre la salud, la nutrición y el bienestar de las poblaciones y las estrategias internacionales de desarrollo social sostenible. No es producto del azar, que la mayor parte de los responsables de la Ayuda Internacional (AI) están francamente convencidos de que el hecho de considerar la salud y la nutrición como una prioridad en los presupuestos generales del estado, es una estrategia eficaz de desarrollo global.Save to LibraryDownloadby José Carlos  Suárez-Herrera•  5  Globalization, Global Health, Social Development in developing countries, Health EquityNextLast »Related TopicsHealth InequalitiesFollowFollowingGlobal HealthFollowFollowingSocial Determinants of HealthFollowFollowingOdontologíaFollowFollowingIncome DistributionFollowFollowingHealth DisparitiesFollowFollowingPublic HealthFollowFollowingSocial InequalitiesFollowFollowingHealth PolicyFollowFollowingHealth PromotionFollowFollowing 71.6 million researchers use this site every month.
