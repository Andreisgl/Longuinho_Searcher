This region provides water to half of the human kind, and the understanding of its water cycle is therefore of utmost importance in the light of global warming. A key element in the study of the water cycle is the Land Surface Temperature (LST) since it characterizes the evapo-transpiration regime of the vegetation. To that end, LST retrieval algorithms were developed and adapted for the estimation of LST from various sensors: ERS (European Remote Sensing satellite)/ATSR2 (Along Track Scanning Radiometer), ENVISAT (Environmental Satellite)/AATSR (Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer), TERRA/MODIS (MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), AQUA/MODIS, NOAA-07 (National Oceanic and Atmosp...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Correcting AVHRR Long Term Data Record V3 estimated LST from orbital drift effectsRemote Sensing of Environment,  2012ABSTRACT NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) satellite series is known to suff... more ABSTRACT NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) satellite series is known to suffer from what is known as the orbital drift effect. The Long Term Data Record (LTDR [Pedelty et al., 2007]), which provides AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) data from these satellites for the 80s and the 90s, is also affected by this orbital drift. To correct this effect on Land Surface Temperature (LST) time series, a novel method is presented here, which consists in adjusting retrieved LST time series on the basis of statistical information extracted from the time series themselves. This method is as simple and straightforward as possible, in order to be implemented easily for such a large dataset as the LTDR. The correction is applied on a pixel by pixel basis, and relies on a 2nd order polynomial fit of per satellite solar zenithal angle (SZA) anomalies against time. If the pixel time series is identified as contaminated by the orbital drift for any of the different satellite active periods, LST anomalies are fitted linearly against both time and the 2nd order polynomial fit of SZA anomalies. This double fit allows for the removal of orbital drift influence without removing eventual trends in the signal, which is of utmost importance for vegetation change detection. When applied to simulated LST time series, this method shows errors comparable to the errors associated to LST estimation for most cases. When applied to LTDR LST time series, the approach normalizes the distribution of LST values at the beginning and end of each satellite activity period, and visual inspection of the time series does not show any residual orbital drift in the corrected LST time series. The approach also improves the significance of retrieved trends through the whole time span of the LTDR dataset. The application of this method to the whole LTDR dataset could lead to the compilation of the first coherent global dataset of land surface temperature. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Trend Analysis of Global MODIS-Terra Vegetation Indices and Land Surface Temperature Between 2000 and 2011Ieee Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing,  2013ABSTRACT Previous works have shown that the combination of vegetation indices with land surface t... more ABSTRACT Previous works have shown that the combination of vegetation indices with land surface temperature (LST) improves the analysis of vegetation changes. Here, global MODIS-Terra monthly data from 2000 to 2011 were downloaded and organized into LST, NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) time series. These time series were then corrected from cloud and atmospheric residual contamination through the IDR (iterative Interpolation for Data Reconstruction) method. Then, statistics were retrieved from both corrected time series, and the YLCD (Yearly Land Cover Dynamics) approach has been applied to data sources (NDVI-LST and EVI-LST) to analyze changes in the vegetation. Finally, trends were retrieved and their statistical significance was assessed through the Mann-Kendall statistical framework. Global statistics show that both data sets lead to similar trends, as is the case for the spatial distribution of observed trends. These trends confirm previous results as well as prediction of climate warming consequences, such as a marked increase in boreal temperatures.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

However, the Spinning Enhanced Visible Infra-Red Imager (SEVIRI) sensor onboard Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) geostationary satellite has never been used for this goal. Here, five years of MSG-SEVIRI data have been processed to retrieve Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) daily time series. Due to existing gaps as well as atmospheric and cloud contamination in the time series, an algorithm based on the iterative Interpolation for Data Reconstruction (IDR) has been developed and applied to SEVIRI NDVI time series, from which phenological parameters have been retrieved. The modified IDR (M-IDR) algorithm shows results of a similar quality to the original method, while dealing more efficiently with increased temporal resolution. The retrieved phenological phases were then analyzed and compared with an independent MODIS (Moderate resolution Imaging Spectrometer) dataset. Comparison of SEVIRI and MODIS-derived phenology with a pan-European ground phenology record shows a high accuracy of the SEVIRI-retrieved green-up and brown-down dates (within days) for most of the selected European validation sites, while differences with MODIS product are higher although this can be explained by differences in methodology. This confirms the potential of MSG data for phenological studies, with the advantage of a quicker availability of the data.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
