Wikipedia introduces new features to entice editors
The Wikimedia Foundation, which operates Wikipedia, has been quietly working on a slew of new features which it hopes will encourage more people to contribute to the free, crowdsourced encyclopedia.

Earlier this month, Wikipedia launched version 1.0 of VisualEditor, a way to edit pages without needing to learn the arcane 'wiki markup language'. 
In the past, editing Wikipedia has required people to learn some wiki markup – the syntax and keywords used by the MediaWiki software to format a page. While this was considered acceptable in 2001, today it drives away some contributors. 
Now VisualEditor allows users to edit and become members of the community, even if they are not wiki markup experts. 
“If you know the Wiki user interface it's very primitive. You click on 'edit' and you get basically plain text but with lots of codes in it. We think this is problematic because it excludes a lot of people from editing,” said Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales at an event in London on Monday evening. 
“VisualEditor is a user interface that is much more familiar to people. When you click edit you get something that looks very much like any word processor, and you can change things and do whatever you want.”
Although VisualEditor has been available as an opt-in "alpha" release on the English-language Wikipedia since December 2012, it is now the default for new editors. However, editing purely in “wikitext” will remain an option for experienced editors who find it faster and more precise. 
“This is version 1.0, which means it is the first one that has really had mass adoption and mass use,” said Wales. “We've had a lot of feedback and there's going to be a lot of upgrades and changes, and we're investing a lot in that kind of thing.”
Wikipedia is also working to improve its notification system. In the past editors were greeted with what Wales described as “the orange bar of doom” whenever somebody left them a message. Now Wikipedia's notification system is more like Facebook, with a little number appearing in the corner of the screen. 
Notifications are also sorted into categories, so editors can distinguish between messages thanking them for an edit, mentions by other users, and changes that are relevant to them. 
“For me this has been a fabulous upgrade because suddenly I see things that I would have never seen before,” said Wales. 
Meanwhile, Flow is a planned change to talk pages and other non-article workflows in the MediaWiki software, designed to make it easier for newcomers to interact with the community. Wales described this as one of Wikipedia's “more ambitious and exciting” projects, adding that it will launch around Christmas time. 
Central to Wikipedia's attempts to entice new editors is its mobile strategy. While reading Wikipedia on a mobile device is not a problem, editing is a big challenge. Wales said that his development team is now working on ways to improve the experience of editing articles from a mobile device. 
In particular, he is keen for Wikipedia to make use of the geo codes that many articles are tagged with. For example, an article on the Eiffel Tower would be tagged with its GPS coordinates in machine-readable format. 
“On the web that's just an interesting titbit of information. On mobile clearly that's massive, it's really important and should be a key part of the user interface,” said Wales. 
Wales is not just interested in attracting new editors, however. He is also keen to encourage new developers and entrepreneurs to start making better use of Wikipedia's freely licensed data and application programming interface (API). 
Much of this data has been encoded in machine-readable format for the Wikidata free knowledge base, which centralises access to and management of structured data. This data is characterised, catalogued and tagged in various ways to make it easily accessible to developers. 
“With open data on the rise and with our efforts to make our data more accessible, I think there's a lot of really interesting initiatives and things that can come out of this,” said Wales. 
He compared it to the launch of Facebook's Social Graph API in 2007, which allowed people in the ecosystem to use Facebook data to create all kinds of new and interesting services. 
“We've got all this data within Wikipedia – it's a very very large set of vetted, carefully thought-about, argued-about, debated data ... You can have all these kinds of connections that you can generate, and this is the concept of Wikidata,” said Wales. 
He pointed to the efforts of governments around the world to put public data into machine-readable formats, suggesting that this data could be combined with Wikipedia data to power new applications. 
The Wikimedia Foundation will be hosting its annual international conference, Wikimania, in London next year, where it will discuss these developments in more detail. The company is hoping to attract 10,000 people to the event, and Wales predicted that it would be “the most outward-looking Wikimania that we've ever had”.
