Fluxus Resonances in Southeast AsiaPathways of Performativity in Contemporary Art of Southeast Asia,  2022Recognised as one of the formative artistic practices after the Second World War, Fluxus emerged ... more Recognised as one of the formative artistic practices after the Second World War, Fluxus emerged in the 1960s comprising a diverse and dispersed international community of artists. Their works were bound by creative exchanges of found objects, mail art and instruction-based performances open to re-enactments by others. While Fluxus activities have been extensively studied in relation to Western Europe, North America and East Asia, this paper argues that Fluxus 'resonances', or parallel developments in practices and concepts, may be charted within Southeast Asian visual art and performative practices since the 1960s. Seen alongside Fluxus resonances across Latin America and Eastern Europe, a study of Fluxus in Southeast Asia reveals a performative 'translation' of ideas and practices which continue to survive in the work of artists such as Philippines-based Judy Freya Sibayan.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It brings together renowned scholars and curators from the disciplines of art history, film and music studies, whose work explores the central role of performance in bridging the visual arts, theatre, dance, music and political activism in the region from the 1960s to the present. The conference aims to deepen historical awareness of the long-standing performance-based practices in Southeast Asia, while opening up dialogues around diasporic and migrant entanglements. It explores the relationship between intermediality and historical developments, especially performative practices that have been impacted by advances in technology. This discussion takes on more urgent resonances as it is framed in relation to the notions of 'identity' and 'activism' within the region in light of an increasing policing of the public media platforms. Projecting these discussions into the future, the conference concludes by exploring the intersection of performance and archiving, questioning the possibilities yielded through historicisation and research. The symposium is accompanied by the launch of the exhibition Archives in Residence: Southeast Asia Performance Collection, curated by Eva Bentcheva, Annie Jael Kwan and Damian Lentini, as part of the series 'Archives in Residence' in Haus der Kunst's Archive Gallery. It presents video documentation from the 'Southeast Asia Performance Collection', an expansive research project and digital archive compiled by an international team of researchers and curators in the UK and Asia between 2015 and 2017. This archive contains documentation of performance-based works such as live art, urban and social interventions by over fifty artists from across Southeast Asia and its diasporas. The exhibition presents a selection of these materials for the first time in Germany, and explores the relationship between performativity and digital exchanges, networks and virtual preservation across Southeast Asia, with a particular focus on Cambodia, Vietnam, Singapore and the Philippines.

However, little attention has been paid to Fluxus activities in Southeast Asia. In contrast to the existence of interpersonal Fluxus networks in East Asia, Fluxus practices and principles reached Southeast Asia primarily through what art historian Reiko Tomii terms ‘resonances’ (2016). This paper discusses how Fluxus resonated in Southeast Asia through word-of-mouth, fragmented documentation, publications and gift-giving between the 1960s and 1980s. Focusing on such modes of transmission in the Philippines – a nation which had a prolific conceptual and contemporary art scene amidst the dictatorial regime of President Ferdinand Marcos (1968-86) - this paper examines the Fluxus resonances via two artists: David Cortez Medalla (1942-2020) who came into contact with Fluxus figures and ideas while resident in France and Britain between the 1960s and 1980s, and Judy Freya Sibayan (1953 -) who studied fine art in Manila during the 1970s when she developed a strong awareness of Fluxus practices from her peers, as well as circulating accounts and documentary materials. Through examples of their works, this paper argues that the Philippines - and Southeast Asia more broadly – does not represent a belated ‘outpost’ of Fluxus networks. Rather, it is a site where Fluxus’ playful experiments, exchanges, multiple authorship, and poetic gestures were actively ‘translated’ (Mignolo & Walsh, 2018) as part of a postcolonial vision to identify with what artist Robert Filiou described as the ‘eternal network’ (1967) of experimental art beyond national and institutional strictures.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Moreover, does archiving performative art necessitate not only material, but also social, polyvocal and temporal forms of documentation? These questions have been at the heart of academic, as well as curatorial and artistic engagements with Performance Art over the past decade. In this talk, I will reflect upon my personal experiences of participating in the creation, as well as curating, an archive of performance art of/from Southeast Asia in the UK and Germany between 2016-19. Looking to more recent works such as Tuan Mami’s performative installation Immigrating Garden (2011 – present), I will conclude by discussing the key role of artists in developing archival forms which capture invisible voices and histories.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
'Researching Performance Art in a Transnational Context: Where is the 'Transnational'?', Transnationalism and its new spatial frames: artists, objects and forms of deterritorialization, symposium, University of Amsterdam, 22 June 2021With an emphasis on mobility, exchanges and interaction, performance art has often been situated ... more With an emphasis on mobility, exchanges and interaction, performance art has often been situated beyond the borders of national art histories. Yet, despite its seemingly 'transnational' nature, performance art practices often draw upon nationally-rooted notions of community, site, history, participation and presence. This presentation reflects upon two research projects which I have developed; my doctoral research on performance art histories through the lens of British South Asian diasporic identities in Britain since the 1960s, and my ongoing postdoctoral research on the post-World War II histories of 'performativity' in contemporary art of Southeast Asia. It compares and contrasts the methodologies used in these two research projects. In doing so, it hones in on several ensuing questions: where do the 'transnational' elements of performance art reside - in the works themselves or the biographies of the artists? To what ends have the notions of mobility, migration and exchange been privileged in the study of performance art? What are some of the idiosyncratic ways in which artists consciously deploy performance to position themselves across international and national aesthetics, as well as socio-political practices?Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Both artists developed a series of participatory performances in the 1960s and 1970s - Araeen’s Canal Events and Mohanti’s Painting-Performances – in which they activated viewers and sites via abstract painting, sculpture, collective actions and dance. After initially staging these works in the UK, particularly London, Araeen and Mohanti also enacted them in Karachi and Orissa. This paper delves into the dynamics of recognition and (mis)interpretation as the works took form across various sites. Drawing on art historian Monica Juneja’s (2011) exploration of the term “global” as a space riddled with local contingencies, as well as Kobena Mercer’s (2006) study of Abstraction’s cross-fertisiling capabilities, this paper explores Araeen and Mohanti’s performances as gestures of aesthetic ‘translation’. It revisits how the artists drew upon contemporary, vernacular and literary forms in order to articulate the parameters – and, at times, incommensurability – of artistic forms traversing London and South Asia between the 1960s and 1980s.  Talk available at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-I-WYoLobeISave to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
'Filming between Fiction and Reality: Docu-Fiction Ventures into Female Labour of Overseas Filipino Workers', Global Working Worlds in Contemporary Art, symposium, 22 January 2021, Ruhr University BochumIn 2020, startling images of Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) in Singapore and Hong Kong made glo... more In 2020, startling images of Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) in Singapore and Hong Kong made global headlines. In the midst of a worldwide call for social distancing and self-isolation to combat the Covid-19 pandemic, thousands of domestic helper OFWs were banished from their employers’ homes and assigned to packed living quarters. Unable to resume work, nor return to the Philippines in the wake of regional travel bans, their predicament became a visual trope for the precariousness, exploitation and vulnerability of Southeast Asian workers in a global capitalist economy.  Female labour of OFWs has in particular been thematised in prolific research over the past two decades. From domestic helpers in Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan, and the Middle East, to nurses in Europe and the USA, and subjects of the thriving transnational industry of ‘mail order brides’, the figure of the Philippine female worker has become a recurrent figure in studies on gender and exploitation in ‘labour diasporas’ (Cohen, 1997). Within contemporary art, however, there has been a notable effort to move beyond the common trope of ‘exploitation’ defining a number of sociological studies.  These efforts have a found a productive voice in multimedia art and experimental film, particularly in the genre of ‘docu-fiction’; a mode of filmmaking which traverses real life experiences and fictional modes of narration and representation.  Shifting away from documentary modes of capturing Filipina workers’ experiences (as seen in acclaimed films such as Babyruth Villarama’s Sunday Beauty Queen (2016) on self-organised beauty pageants by domestic workers in Hong Kong), this talk examines how artists working with ‘docu-fiction’ have unravelled labour via filmic explorations. It presents different docu-fiction film approaches developed by three multimedia artists: London-based Vanessa Scully, Toronto/Berlin-based Stephanie Comilang and Berlin-based Lizza May David.  Scully’s ongoing series, Maid in Mayfair (2017) and Marisa 4.0 (2018), delves into the role of music videos and commercials as formats influencing the reception of domestic helpers and mail order brides in Britain and Australia. Further delving into the role of surveillance and communication technologies, Comilang’s Come to Me, Paradise (2016) explores the intersections of agency, self-presentation and the overbearing presence of the state and employer in the day-to-day lives of OFWs in Hong Kong. Finally, David’s Looking Inwards (2008) examines the role of filmic self-documentation and digital photography as a form of autobiographical communication between the Philippines, Hong Kong and Germany. Focusing on their recourse to self-representation, communication technologies, popular culture and advertisement, this talk discusses how Scully, Comilang and David develop filmic approaches to investigate (self)constructions of Philippine female labourers.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It defines performance art as action or inter-action in the context of the visual arts, and examines the ways it was mobilised in Rasheed Araeen's Canal Events (1968–72) staged in London, Paris and Karachi; Prafulla Mohanti's Painting-Performances (1960s–90s) developed in Leeds, London and Orissa; and Sutapa Biswas's Kali (1984) enacted during her undergraduate degree at Leeds University.Taking up the frameworks of ‘itinerancy’ (Adadol-Ingawanij, 2018) and ‘disobedience’ (Mignolo, 2009), this talk discusses the central role of uncomfortable or risky encounters and mobility in these works, and their emphasis on independent thought and personal subjectivity which went beyond national narratives and over-arching discourses on postcolonialism or ‘black art’. In doing so, it proposes that Araeen, Mohanti and Biswas’s performances can be situated alongside works by artists such as David Medalla and Mona Hatoum, in whose practices performance presented expanded possibilities for negotiating ‘transnationalism’ as both perspective and artistic method in Britain between the 1960s and 1980s.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

'Framing the Birth of Black Phoenix (1978-79)', Axis of Solidarity: Landmarks, Platforms and Futures, Tate Modern, London / Cornell University, 23-25 February 2019This paper delves into the discursive space from which the short-lived periodical Black Phoenix: ... more This paper delves into the discursive space from which the short-lived periodical Black Phoenix: Third World Perspective on Contemporary Art and Culture (1978-79) was born. Often regarded as the amateur precursor to the influential journal Third Text: Critical Perspectives on Contemporary Art and Culture founded by Rasheed Araeen in 1987, Black Phoenix’s conversational, experimental and critical nature is due revisitation. Conceived by Araeen in editorial collaboration with Mahmood Jamal in 1977, Black Phoenix evolved into a platform for voicing alternative views on the notion of ‘Third World perspectives’. This paper maps this self-reflexive turn within two developments; The first locates Black Phoenix as part of a lineage of artist-led publications in Britain which tackled the parameters of ‘internationalism’ during the 1960s and 1970s, most notably Signals: Newsbulletin of the Centre for Advanced Creative Study, edited by David Medalla between 1964-66. The second considers how Black Phoenix drew on the oral and discursive spirit of artist-activist alliances in London during the 1970s, particularly through Araeen’s participation in the politico-creative platform Artists For Democracy (1974-77). Witnessing the allegiances and differences between participants in this group, Black Phoenix evolved not only to voice idealism, but also to engage with the contradictions, challenges and failures at stake in the formation of ‘Third World’ alliances.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
'Contextualising 'Experimentalism' in Performance Art from Southeast Asia, 1960s to the Present', Centre for Performance and Creative Exchange, University of Roehampton, 5 December 2018This talk explores how the notion of ‘experimentalism’ – a term circulated in numerous guises - h... more This talk explores how the notion of ‘experimentalism’ – a term circulated in numerous guises - has underpinned trajectories of performance art in Southeast Asia since the 1960s. It focuses on its early iterations in the Philippines and Indonesia. Between the 1960s and 1980s, these two nations saw the emergence of a number of conceptually and performance-leaning practices within the visual arts. Often described as ‘experiments’ within the contemporary, these works were intended to surmount the boundaries of fine art and trigger greater discursive production. However, they also served to navigate the cultural politics of the dictatorial Marcos (1965-86) and Suharto (1967-98) regimes. This talk argues that while these practices yielded formal similarities, their political motivations differed substantially across the two nations. In the Philippines, early proponents of conceptual and performance art often straddled the divide between independent ‘experimental’ practices, and government-championed forms of abstraction, installation and site-specific art. In contrast, in Indonesia the evolution of ‘experimentalism’, particularly as it has been associated with the works of Gerakan Seni Rupa Baru (Indonesian New Art Movement), agitated for greater social and political consciousness. Highlighting these differences, this talk calls for a tracing of performance art histories through the lens of ‘experimentalism’, which accounts for interconnections and parallel streams of interest (as opposed to linear progressions), as well as specific national contexts and dynamics.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
'From Ephemeral Experiences to Lasting Legacies: Mapping Performance Art and Conceptualism in the Philippines in the 1960s and 1970s', SOAS/Tate Research Centre: Asia, London, 3 May 2018Contrary to the belief that performance art and conceptual practices are recent developments in c... more Contrary to the belief that performance art and conceptual practices are recent developments in contemporary Southeast Asian art, the visual arts in the Philippines have been a fertile ground for experiments in process, interactivity and participation since the 1960s. From the installation-like ‘environments’ of Roberto Chabet (1937-2013), to the community-centered compositions of José Maceda (1917-2004), and even the interactive performances of David Medalla (1938 -), Judy Sibayan (1963 -) and Raymundo Albano (1947-85), artists working during the 1960s and 1970s continually sought to navigate the boundaries between experimental practices, the cultural politics of the Marcos regime (1965-86), and international discourses around contemporary art and the ‘avant-garde’.This talk presents findings and reflections from my ongoing research on performance art and conceptualism in the Philippines. It explores the different roles and contexts through which Chabet, Maceda, Albano, Sibayan and Medalla came to deploy ‘process-based’ tactics within their art. Notwithstanding the fact that they hailed from different backgrounds - Chabet, Albano and Sibayan all produced art alongside careers as curators and teachers in public institutions in Manila, Medalla devoted his life to art while traversing the creative circles of Europe and the Philippines, while Maceda was active as a composer and ethnomusicologist in the Philippines and internationally – seen together, they provide valuable insights into the evolution of both practice and discourse. This paper highlights the ways in which they contributed to the development of a rich discourse around process, performance, and conceptualism through their practices, writings and wider socio-political engagements over the course of the 1960s and 1970s. It further uses their works as the basis to challenge two oft-cited assumptions about performance art and conceptualism in Southeast Asia more broadly. First, that these media emerged largely outside institutional frameworks within the region. Second, that performance art and conceptualism in Southeast Asia served historically as tools for institutional and political critique.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
'On the Heels of Forgotten Histories: Assemblage, Research and Re-Enactment in Contemporary Southeast Asian Art', Contemporary Art and the Politics of Process, University of Notre Dame, London, 19 April 2018Speaking at the symposium 'The Readymade Century' (Haus der Kulturen der Welt, October 2017), Fre... more Speaking at the symposium 'The Readymade Century' (Haus der Kulturen der Welt, October 2017), French-Algerian artist Kader Attia argued for the need to reassess the legacy of Marcel Duchamp’s ‘readymade’ object as a challenge to the sanctity of art and its institutions. In light of his own practice (which excavates historical artefacts and reworks them into crafty installations), Attia argued that salvaging, researching and reconfiguring ‘found objects’ are now central strategies in contemporary art from Africa, the Middle East and Asia. They mirror a wider effort to unpack the fragmented and scattered vestiges of colonial memory. Taking up Attia’s call to think about assemblage art in the age of postcolonialism as an exercise in research, this paper argues that this approach has developed a strong foothold in contemporary art from Southeast Asia. It is particularly compelling for artists whose work explores the diasporic predicament and liminality of Southeast Asia in European histories. Focusing on UK-based public performances of Filipino artists David Medalla and Noel Ed De Leon, as well as the research strategies of UK-based Singaporean artist Erika Tan and Thai multimedia artist Arin Rungjang, this paper discusses the diverse approaches to navigating the boundaries between assemblage, research and re-enactment in exploring forgotten and marginal histories of Southeast Asia in Europe.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
'Conceptualism-Scepticism and Creative Cross-Pollinations in the work of David Medalla, 1969-72 ', Conceptualism – Intersectional Readings, International Framings: Black Artists and Modernism in Europe after 1968, 8-9 December 2017, Van Abbemuseum, EindhovenPhilippines-born artist David Medalla has long-espoused a diverse practice which converses with ‘... more Philippines-born artist David Medalla has long-espoused a diverse practice which converses with ‘conceptual art’ in a range of formal and philosophical ways. Describing his own sculptural and performance works in the 1960s and 1970s as non-instructional, open to all, poetic in form and content, and, above all else, rooted in an international outlook, Medalla’s works from the period offer rich case studies for questioning conceptualism as intersectional practice. My paper explores the possibilities and limitations of situating his early practices at the crossroad between conceptualism in Europe (as envisioned in the curatorial and academic frameworks of Harald Szeemann, Sigi Krauss, and Guy Brett, among others), and art and politics in the Philippines in the late 1960s. I will focus here on Medalla’s transition away from kinetic sculpture in the mid-1960s, towards a cross-pollination of conceptualism, performance art and socio-political engagements which followed the artist’s travels around Africa and Asia which culminated in a longer stay in the Philippines in 1969. I propose that the Philippine Conceptualism which surfaced around the time of Medalla’s return did not pose a formal influence on his practice. However, it informed his understanding of the potential of conceptual practices to become institutionally and politically coerced – a notion which he then proceeded to explore and challenge through his practice in Europe over the course of the 1970s, and via his engagement with the ‘black art movement’ in Britain during the 1980s.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

(Moving x Archive x Performance): Archiving Asia', Live Art Development Agency, 3-4 November 2017Since the 1960s, Britain has played host to a number of performance artworks addressing notions of cultural difference, identity and political agency. Its ‘transnational’ history lends a handy context for establishing a contemporary archive of performance art from Southeast Asia. In this archive, iterations of the body, resistance and struggle seem to weave links between the cultural politics of Southeast Asia and Britain. Yet, it also raises concerns around how we present and frame performance art from Southeast Asia. In what ways should we see this archive as part of a lineage of performance artists of Asian, African and Caribbean descent working in Britain? Or rather, do the works from Southeast Asia speak to an altogether different set of concerns and influences? To what extent are identity and politics shared topics across these different performance art histories? This talk opens up these questions in an effort to invite further inquiries into the staging and archiving Southeast Asian performance art within the contemporary British context.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Drawing on Nora Taylor's appropriation of Pierre Nora's notion of lieu de memoire ('sites of memory'), my talk explores how artists of South Asian descent have enacted public, yet non-participatory performances across the UK and South Asia since the 1970s. Arguing that this mode of performance-making evokes real and allegorical connections between the artists' own biographies and historic moments, my paper calls for a closer examination of the relationship between public sites, private/non-participatory actions and visual documentation in the context of mapping performance art across Britain and South Asia.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

However, looking beyond the films' pedagogical role, Diaz also employs a range of representational practices associated with modern and contemporary visual art in the Philippines. Focusing on Diaz's formal strategies-particularly his striking use of perspective, composition and realism-my paper brings his films into conversation with visual art from the Philippines. I propose a reading of his films as part of a tradition of representation which mediates on natural and man-made environments since the Second World War. Highlighting the importance which he places on phenomenological experiences, my paper compares and contrasts Diaz's practice to mid-century Neo-Realist painters, as well as more recent forms of performance art, conceptualism and experimental video and photography, arguing that for a constant slippage between the experiential, political and aesthetic in his work.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The first part of my talk traced the role of socialist ideology in Medalla's early collaborations with America-born artist John Dugger in the works The Peoples Participation Pavilion (Documenta 5, Kassel, 1972) and The People Weave a House! (ICA, London, 1972). I argued that during the late 1960s and early 1970s, Medalla's growing interest in international socialist struggles formed an important basis for producing participation-production art. By invoking socialist ideologies and texts, these works served as a platform for voicing critical views towards capitalist exploitation in Europe and the Philippines. However, this mode of art-making was not determined solely by political ideology. The second part of my talk explored the meditative, conversational and poetic nature of Medalla’s participation-production art. Following the misuse of Medalla's artworks by gallery visitors at the exhibition Pioneers of Participation Art at the Museum of Modern Art Oxford (‘Popa at Moma’) in 1971, Medalla began to reflect upon the artist's role in participatory art. I argue that participation-production performances such as A Stitch in Time (London, 1968/ Gallery House, London, 1972) and Eskimo Carver (Artists For Democracy, 1977) demonstrate Medalla’s commitment to art as, first and foremost, a social and aesthetic process – a feature which characterises his practice to this day.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Within this ... more This research builds upon recent attempts to map the history of live art in Britain. Within this growing body of scholarship, there has been a notable paucity of studies on performance art’s relationship to race and identity politics in the context of postcolonial Britain. In order to address this gap of knowledge, this thesis examines performance-based art by British South Asian artists working in the UK since the 1960s. This thesis does not set out to compile a definitive survey of all British South Asian performance art. Rather, it focuses on select works by Prafulla Mohanti, Rasheed Araeen, Sutapa Biswas, Ansuman Biswas and the collective Motiroti. Situating performance art in the visual arts, this thesis explores why each artist employed performance at specific points in their artistic careers. Drawing on performance research, art history and cultural studies, it examines their works in light of four historical ‘moments’: the search for visibility in the 1960s and 1970s, attempts to generate confrontation in the 1980s, the use of embodiment as a challenge to multicultural policies in the 1990s, and, finally, the staging of ‘museum interventions’ in the 2000s. While these themes do not reflect a definitive history of ‘British South Asian performance art’, they illustrate the close-knit relationship between performance-based practices and the expression of cultural politics in the work of these five artists. In conclusion, this thesis addresses the scholarly value of researching performance art history through the lens of one specific diaspora. Arguing that the works of British South Asian artists cannot be viewed in isolation from wider developments in post-World War II British art, it contends that mapping performance art history through the lens of this diaspora is nevertheless a useful starting point for further research into the cultural politics of performance art in Britain.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

However, little attention has been paid to Fluxus activities in Southeast Asia. In contrast to the existence of interpersonal Fluxus networks in East Asia, Fluxus practices and principles reached Southeast Asia primarily through what art historian Reiko Tomii terms ‘resonances’ (2016). This paper discusses how Fluxus resonated in Southeast Asia through word-of-mouth, fragmented documentation, publications and gift-giving between the 1960s and 1980s. Focusing on such modes of transmission in the Philippines – a nation which had a prolific conceptual and contemporary art scene amidst the dictatorial regime of President Ferdinand Marcos (1968-86) - this paper examines the Fluxus resonances via two artists: David Cortez Medalla (1942-2020) who came into contact with Fluxus figures and ideas while resident in France and Britain between the 1960s and 1980s, and Judy Freya Sibayan (1953 -) who studied fine art in Manila during the 1970s when she developed a strong awareness of Fluxus practices from her peers, as well as circulating accounts and documentary materials. Through examples of their works, this paper argues that the Philippines - and Southeast Asia more broadly – does not represent a belated ‘outpost’ of Fluxus networks. Rather, it is a site where Fluxus’ playful experiments, exchanges, multiple authorship, and poetic gestures were actively ‘translated’ (Mignolo & Walsh, 2018) as part of a postcolonial vision to identify with what artist Robert Filiou described as the ‘eternal network’ (1967) of experimental art beyond national and institutional strictures.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Worlding Art History through SyllabiWorkshop: 'Worlding Art History through Syllabi'

The workshop Worlding Art History through Syllabi takes up the notion of ‘worlding’ to explore how art history is taught in different places and institutions around the world. What would a ‘worlded’ syllabus look like, and how can we collaboratively ‘world’ global art history?A ‘worlded’ art history rejects the idea of a single global world framed, ordered and represented according to Eurocentric premises or as universally constituted by global capitalism. Instead, it conceives of the global as constituted from multiple and entangled geo-cultural perspectives. It is not centered on assumed commonalities of ‘global’ art. Rather, it seeks to shed light on differences and relations. What are histories, epistemologies, and ontologies that constitute ‘global’ art? What are infrastructural or institutional incommensurabilities which define the many intersecting art histories of the present?This workshop is organized as part of the international research project and network ‘Worlding Public Cultures: The Arts and Social Innovation’ (WPC) in cooperation with the ICI Berlin. It invites scholars from the fields of art history, cultural studies, cultural anthropology, media studies, museum studies and other related disciplines to participate in an peer-to-peer exchange of experiences and practices. It focuses on how scholars may, or already have, designed teaching syllabi to complicate dominant frameworks of ‘global’ art history. It is particularly interested in how syllabi have the capacity to restructure pedagogical approaches to teaching topics such as global capitalism in the art world, the so-called Global North-South division, transnational and transcultural entanglements, and differences between teaching regional art histories. This workshop builds upon recent discussions on pedagogies at the Worlding Public Cultures Academy, Lessons Learned? Transcultural Perspectives in Curating and Pedagogies (14-16 July 2022), hosted by the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden. It takes the form of an interactive gathering. Participants are invited to share examples of their own syllabi, as well as speak on the challenges faced in designing syllabi to reflect multiple geo-cultural perspectives, decolonial and ‘global’ art histories. Among the questions which this workshop seeks to address are:● In your experience, how is the situatedness of art history taught across your respective regional, national and local context? • What methodological approaches do you discuss in your teaching?● Which discursive, spatial and temporal frameworks have you structured your syllabi around?● What role does close-looking of artworks play in your courses? How do you connect theoretical readings and visual materials?● Have you been interested in re-conceptualizing art historical methods through comparative approaches?● Do you define the notions of the ‘global’, ‘transnational’ and ‘transcultural’ for students? If so, how?● What are your different approaches to structuring syllabi for undergraduate and postgraduate students? What information do your ‘foundational courses’ provide?● What challenges did you come across? What did students and you appreciate the most?● How have institutional and departmental interests shaped the scope of your teaching ‘global’ art history?● Have you collaborated with museums or other art institutions in your teaching?Credits:Organized by the Heidelberg University team of Worlding Public Cultures: The Arts and Social Innovation (Monica Juneja, Franziska Koch, Eva Bentcheva) in collaboration with Ming Tiampo (WPC / Carleton University) and Birgit Hopfener (WPC / Carleton University), and in cooperation with ICI Berlin.Funding:WPC is funded by a Social Innovation Grant from the Trans-Atlantic Platform for the Social Sciences and Humanities and (within Germany) by the Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung (BMBF/DLR, no. 01UG2026).WPC partner institutions:The WPC platform brings together several institutions that pioneer transnational and transcultural research in the fields of art at Carleton University (Canada), Concordia University (Canada), the University of Montréal (Canada), the University of Quebec in Montréal (Canada), the University of the Arts London (UK), Heidelberg University (Germany), the University of Amsterdam (Netherlands), and Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (Netherlands).

Transcultural Perspectives in Curating and PedagogiesConceptualised and organised by Heidelberg University’s team of Worlding Public Cultures: The Arts and Social Innovation (Monica Juneja, Franziska Koch, Eva Bentcheva, Miriam Oesterreich, Moritz Schwörer, Franziska Kaun, Seunghee Kim)Location: Japanisches Palais, Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden (SKD/Dresden State Art Collections), Dresden, Germany. Organised in the framework of the second edition of the Transcultural Academy organised at the Japanisches Palais. 14-16 July 2022 As the drive to expand, explore and inform museum collections through global histories gains momentum, a pressing question remains: what is the role of art historical pedagogy in the museum? The concept of pedagogy is etymologically posited on the distinction between an adult and a child, and privileges teaching over learning. In past decades, there has been a decisive move to rethink the role of museums away from teaching through visuality (Svetlana Alpers) towards becoming sites of emancipatory and critical learning. Exhibitions such as the Documentas X and XI (curated by Catherine David in 1997 and Okwui Enwezor in 2002 respectively) or the iteration of Havana Biennale directed by Gerardo Mosquera in 1989, adopted open transactions across curating, learning and teaching. In addition, a growing number of cross-disciplinary platforms and collectives across the Global North and South – small in scale, locally anchored, and horizontally organized – have brought forth radical modes of cultural critique and transnational networks opposing exploitation, precarity, homophobia, militarisation and xenophobia. The radicalism of such “micro-organizations” (Marion von Osten) has now begun to rebound on larger institutions. Presently, a number of museums, particularly in Europe and North America, are introducing forms of self-reflection about audiences and collections. The international Academy, Lessons Learned? Transcultural Positions in Curating and Pedagogies, explores the successes and failures of existing pedagogical practices in museums, and potentials for new transcultural and ‘worlded’ approaches. Conceptualised by Heidelberg University’s team of the international research platform, Worlding Public Cultures: The Arts and Social Innovation, this Academy unfolds as a three-day series of on-site and virtual discussions and exhibition visits around the SKD from 14-16 July 2022. The SKD museums hold amongst the most important and expansive present-day collections in Germany that speak to histories of transcultural collecting and conservation since the 16th century. Given its commitment to critically reflecting historical as well as contemporary collecting and curatorial practices, SKD will hold a ‘Transcultural Academy’ at the Japanese Palace later in 2022. This cross-collections initiative aims to rethink curatorial presentations, current debates around decolonization and audience engagement via an artist residency programme. The programme around Lessons Learned? will conclude with a seperate lecture and an ‘intellectual space’ on 20 July 2022 (16:00-18:00 CET on Zoom). This will feature a guest lecture by Prof. Emerita Claire Farago, two invited responses and a public discussion on how to (un)learn art history through university teaching. Conceptualised by Heidelberg University’s team of Worlding Public Cultures: The Arts and Social Innovation. In cooperation with the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden (SKD / Dresden State Art Collection), this Academy unfolds as a three-day series of on-site and virtual discussions and exhibition visits around the various collections in the framework of the second edition of the Transcultural Academy organised at the Japanisches Palais.Conference recordings:https://voices.skd.museum/en/voices-mag/wpc-academy-lessons-learned-transcultural-perspectives-in-curating-and-pedagogies/Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
