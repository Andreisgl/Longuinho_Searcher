AD 816–886) belonged to the Constantinopolitan intellectual élite and was a prominent teacher. His liturgical poetic oeuvre comprises different subgenres. However, he is best known for his kanones. A kanon is a long hymn penned in one of the eight Byzantine modes and sung during the early morning office (Orthros). The present critical edition aims to determine the original text of groups consisting of eight kanones each and dedicated to prominent saints. Within each group, Joseph composed one kanon per mode.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Like Father, Like Son. An Unknown Hymn of George Eugenicus (Sing to the Lord a New Song! Cult, Devotion, and Aesthetics in Late Byzantine Poetry 13th to 15th Centuries. Workshop.

Even if their father, deacon George Eugenicus, died when they were still very young, it seems that he paved the way for their glorious future. Yet, there is limited information about him. Between 1389 and 1406(†), George held the high offices of logothetes, protonotarios, protekdikos, and sakellion of the Great Church of Constantinople. He was also a renowned teacher with numerous students and the composer of an Acoluthia in honor of Saint Spyridon around 1400. The aim of this paper is to present George Eugenicus’ unknown canon on Saint Spyridon and to introduce him as a hymnographer for the first time. Delving into his writing style, I will seek for his literary and melismatic preferences. Was he innovative and, if so, how much? I will subsequently explore his scholarly  background and examine whether he influenced his children or contemporaries of his. Finally, I will study the canon as part of the whole manuscript (Sab. gr. 503 – Diktyon 34760), which is some kind of AnthologionSave to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
TRANSFER OF KNOWLEDGE -TRANSFER OF IDEAS -TRANSFER OF EXPERIENCES LATIN TRANSLATIONS OF GREEK TEXTS FROM THE 11 TH TO THE 13 TH CENTURYby Péter Bara and Paraskevi TomaOfficial Conference Programme,  2021International workshop on Greek-Latin translations, 11th–13th centuries
In the co-organisation ... more International workshop on Greek-Latin translations, 11th–13th centuriesIn the co-organisation of the Byzantine and Modern Greek Studies Department of the University of Münster and the Section of Philosophy and Historical Sciences of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, a two-day workshop took place on 10th and 11th June 2021 via Zoom. Participants of the workshop discussed questions that relate to translations from Greek into Latin during the 11th–13th centuries. The novelty of the event lay in the fact that speakers tried to grasp the phenomenon of translations in their complexity. They examined the question of translations through different media (manuscripts, inscriptions, art historical objects) in the field of, strictly speaking, translation literature and everyday life.The period under discussion witness the expansion of the Latin West towards Sicily, the Levant, finally, intrusion to Byzantium itself. In parallel to the change of power balance, developments in theology, philosophy, medicine, and in the sciences gained new impetus by the mediation of translations from Arabic and Greek. The works of such authors as Aristotle, Galen, or Euclide, and those of the church fathers were translated into Latin on the basis of Arabic and Greek manuscripts and became gradually part of the university curricula and contributed to the intellectual profile of such centres as the Norman Sicilian court. The most important centres for Greek-Latin translations were Constantinople, the Italian merchant states, France and England.The first session of the workshop focused on how translations from Greek into Latin influenced developments in disciplines such as theology, law, or philosophy. Furthermore, the agency and role of translators was dicussed: who were they in different regions; how they showed their credentials that their translatory work is proper; in which way they influenced political decision-making. Finally, in the third panel, speakers examined how translations shaped religious and liturgical practice, or story-telling, and in which way inscriptions and art historical evidence help the understanding of the translation phenomenon.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The first hymn is a prayer addressed to Jesus Christ and the second one is a hymn dedicated to the Mother of God. The presentation will be divided in three sections. In the first part, I will examine the relation between the hymns and the content of the manuscript. Paleographical and codicological remarks will shed more light upon the dating and the origin of the codex. In the second section, I will focus on the text. Editorial difficulties and decisions as well as technical details, such as intonation and meter, will be discussed. In the third and last part, I will draw attention to the literary aspects of the hymns and try to situate them in the wider biblical and patristic context.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Monastic Saints in Exile: From Political Criticism to instabilitas loci (Holiness on the Move. Travelling Saints in Byzantium. An international Workshop. Newcastle, 22 February 2019)During the eighth and ninth centuries, prominent monastics (and later saints), such as Germanos I... more During the eighth and ninth centuries, prominent monastics (and later saints), such as Germanos I of Constantinople, Theodore the Stoudite, Joseph the Hymnographer, and Photios I of Constantinople, were forced—sometimes more than once— to abandon their religious communities due to their political attitude against the emperor. How did they perceive and undergo the imposed displacement? While Germanos, Joseph, and Photios refer to exile (ἐξορία) occasionally, for Theodore it is a focal point. His epistolary and catechetical work provides a rich source on different aspects of exile, which fall into two main categories: i) the  worldly exile as a result of civil disobedience, and ii) the spiritual exile as a result of disobedience to God. In most cases, the signified is adjusted to the textual typology. The exile in Theodore’s Letters is associated mainly with the contemporary political situation and the way the author experiences it. On the other hand, the exile in his Catecheses has a more introvert and penitential tone. As abbot of the Stoudios Monastery and a spiritual guide, Theodore emphasized the religious dimension of exile by relating it with the banishment from the Garden of Eden and the martyrial suffering. Therefore, this paper will shed more light upon the Byzantine perception of exile, which differentiates from the antique exilic literary tradition, as well as upon the religious aspects imposed by  Christianity and the monastic way of life.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The three  Syntagmata (ca. 1222–1225) are the result of this experience. The text summarizes the theological dialogue between the two Churches after the Schism (1054) with a focus on the Orthodox argumentation.  Nikolaos composed the treatise two-columned in two languages, Greek and Latin. According to R. Jakobson (1953), bilingualism [...] is the fundamental problem of linguistics. It may induce some difficulties in textual criticism, too. The case of bilingual authors that write monolingual texts is customary. What happens, though, when they write bilingually? In which language did Nikolaos first pen the three Syntagmata? Did he compose in both languages simultaneously, or sequentially? Textual signs of the two surviving autographs could answer these questions.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Die Zeitrechnung diente schon immer als Orientierung für das Volk. Wurde ein Heiliger jedes Mal an einem bestimmten Tag gefeiert, gewann er durch den Kalender einen mächtigen Einfluss auf das christliche Bewusstsein. Nach welchen Kriterien aber wurden die gepriesene Heilige ausgewählt? Obwohl Joseph Kirchengedichte auf verschiedene Heilige geschrieben hat, gibt es keins, das einen Heiligen des prorömischen Studionklosters, wie z.B. den Onkel oder die Mutter Theodores Studites, Platon bzw. Theoktiste, ehrt. Mit dieser Tat versuchte er als maßvoller Bilderfreund die Beeinflussung der eifrigen, zeitgenössischen Studiten zu entkräften.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In essence, Theodore employs his rich literary background to free himself from the physical boundaries of exile.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
