The method was compared with conventional PCR. This new method had a sensitivity of 96.7% and a specificity of 96.7% for disease detection. The new method also proved suitable for use in the field as it reduces time and decreases risk of contamination.Download Free PDFView PDFVirology JournalReemergence of dengue virus type-3 (subtype-III) in India: Implications for increased incidence of DHF & DSS2006 • Ajay AbhyankarDownload Free PDFView PDFPLoS Neglected Tropical DiseasesTwenty Years of DENV-2 Activity in Brazil: Molecular Characterization and Phylogeny of Strains Isolated from 1990 to 20102013 • Monique da Rocha Queiroz LimaDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of clinical microbiologyEarly detection of the dengue virus using reverse transcription-recombinase polymerase amplification2015 • Kim-kee  TanA method for the rapid diagnosis of early dengue virus (DENV) infection is highly needed. Here, a prototype reverse transcription-recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) assay was developed. The assay detected DENV RNA in &lt;20 minutes without the need for thermocycling amplification. The assay enabled the detection of as few as 10 copies of DENV RNA. The designed RT-RPA primers and exo-probe detected the DENV genome of at least 12 genotypes of DENV circulating globally without cross-reacting with other arboviruses. We assessed the diagnostic performance of the RT-RPA assay for the detection of DENV RNA in 203 sera of clinically suspected dengue patients. The sera were simultaneously tested for DENV using RT-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), quantitative RT-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and IgM- and IgG-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Acute DENV infection was confirmed in 130 samples and 61 of the samples (46.9%) were classified as v...Download Free PDFView PDFAsian Pacific Journal of Tropical MedicineConcurrent infections of dengue viruses serotype 2 and 3 in patient with severe dengue from Jakarta, Indonesia2016 • Benediktus Yohan ArmanTo describe the clinical manifestation of patient with severe dengue, to identify the serotypes and genotypes of dengue viruses (DENV) which concurrently infecting the patient, and to explore the possible relationship of severe dengue with the concurrent infection of DENV. Dengue diagnosis was performed using NS1 antigen detection and IgG/IgM ELISA. Standard clinical and laboratory examinations were performed to obtain the clinical and hematological data. DENV concurrent infections were detected and confirmed using RT-PCR and DENV Envelope gene sequencing. Phylogenetic analyses were performed to determine the genotypes of the viruses. The patient was classified as having severe dengue characterized by severe plasma leakage, hemorrhage, and organ damage involving lung, liver, and kidney. Concurrent infection of DENV serotype 2 and 3 was observed. The infecting DENV-2 virus was grouped into Cosmopolitan genotype while DENV-3 virus was classified into Genotype I. Both viruses were closely related to isolates that were endemic in Jakarta. Viremia measurement was conducted and revealed a significantly higher virus titer of DENV-3 compared to DENV-2. The occurrence of multi-serotype DENV infections was presented in a patient with severe clinical manifestation in Indonesia. The hyperendemicity of dengue in Indonesia may contribute to the DENV concurrent infections cases and may underlie the severity of the disease.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
