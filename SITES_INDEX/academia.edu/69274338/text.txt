The multitude of prehistoric, ancient and medieval civilisations that had left their imprint on Ottoman lands was bound to attract the interest of Europeans. Ottoman subjects were not in themselves left uninterested. Visits, digs, illicit traffic, museums and many more activities attest to this. As the 19th century was progressing with the number of manifestations of an interest in ancient finds rising, the Ottoman state decided to take it upon itself to regulate this area of human activity. This presentation discusses the legal responses of the Ottoman state to this rising interest and, more specifically, the laws on antiquities of 1869, 1874, 1884 and 1906. It traces their origins, such as the incidents or other factors that motivated the state to promulgate the laws. It aims to shed light on the topics these laws covered, such as definitions on antiquities, the ownership of finds, stipulations on the import and, significantly, export of antiquities, any protective measures, and the regulation of excavations. It also provides a comparison between Ottoman archaeological legislation and that of the Greek kingdom in an attempt to identify points of convergence and divergence. To what extent was Ottoman policy inspired by Greece’s treatment of antiquities? Finally, this presentation does not fail to investigate the reasons for replacing one law with another. In this, a discussion of how each law was implemented in the vast domains of the empire remains crucial. In all, this presentation aims to provide a comprehensive picture as to the Ottoman legal approaches to antiquities that, together with the development of Ottoman museums, encapsulate Ottoman archaeological policy. In discussing the laws, we shall see how the Ottoman state evolved from being largely a bystander into a guardian of antiquities in its lands.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersArchaeology between Science and IdeologyKatharina GalorDownload Free PDFView PDFFinding Jerusalem: Archaeology between Science and Ideology2017 • Katharina GalorDownload Free PDFView PDFAronsson, P. and Nyblom, A.

The article addresses whether the request from Turkey meets the legal criteria set by Congress in the Cultural Property Implementation Act (CPIA). It also considers whether, if imposed, the MOU would have any positive effect, and if such restrictions could be implemented fairly by U.S. Customs. The article also addresses the Turkish government’s apparent aim to use an agreement designed to protect weak countries from outside looters as political cover for actions that harm the cultural interests of Turkish minorities.Download Free PDFView PDFZeus in Exile: Archaeological Restitution as Politics of Memory2000 • Can BilselDownload Free PDFView PDFBeyond Texts? Potentials and Limitations of a Holistic Approach to Collective Fear in Mesopotamia.2017 • Elisabeth Wagner-DurandWhile scholars in the field of ancient Near Eastern Studies without doubt focus on the physical evidence of past human cultures, some core issues of personhood have rarely come to their attention. Investigating human cultures in the past or present, however, inevitably raises the subject of emotions, especially the issues surrounding fear, including its stimulation, appraisal, coping/management and prevention. Moreover, the investigation of humans as social creatures leads to the question of collective fear. Collective fear – or more precisely the preventive behavior associated with collective fear – is a strong driving force in social, religious and political behavior. While collective fear may be a universal human characteristic, its stimuli, management, and prevention take different shapes throughout time and space. This paper resorts to both texts, as the most obvious and ostensibly most direct sources, and to the archaeological record that has not yet played a substantial rule in the reconstruction of emotions. In this respect, this paper provides a methodological perspective on the whole matter of collective fear in the ancient Near East. Thus, it explores the potential of textual and material sources, the approaches that can be taken, and the insights we can gain with respect to the social and political structures of past societies, especially those of the ancient Near East, where collective fear clearly played an important role that extends deeply into the domains of power, politics and religion.Download Free PDFView PDFZarządzanie w KulturzeOwnership and Participation: democratizing the administration of antiquities2017 • Maria KouriDownload Free PDFView PDFBuilding National Museums in Europe 1750–2010: Conference proceedings from EuNaMus, European National Museums: Identity Politics, the Uses of the Past and …2011 • Gabriella Elgenius, Peter  AronssonDownload Free PDFView PDFBuilding National Museums in Europe 1750– …Aronsson & Elgenius, 2011.
