The lifetimes are measured to be $221\pm15(\rm stat.)\pm19(\rm syst.)$\,ps for ${}^3_\Lambda \rm{H}$ and $218\pm6(\rm stat.)\pm13(\rm syst.)$\,ps for ${}^4_\Lambda \rm{H}$. The $p_T$-integrated yields of ${}^3_\Lambda \rm{H}$ and ${}^4_\Lambda \rm{H}$ are presented in different centrality and rapidity intervals. It is observed that the shape of the rapidity distribution of ${}^4_\Lambda \rm{H}$ is different for 0--10\% and 10--50\% centrality collisions. Thermal model calculations, using the canonical ensemble for strangeness, describes the ${}^3_\Lambda \rm{H}$ yield well, while underestimating the ${}^4_\Lambda \rm{H}$ yield.

The Λ_{c}/D^{0} [denoting (Λ_{c}^{+}+Λ_{c}^{-})/(D^{0}+D[over ¯]^{0})] yield ratio is measured to be 1.08±0.16  (stat)±0.26  (sys) in the 0%-20% most central Au+Au collisions for the transverse momentum (p_{T}) range 3&lt;p_{T}&lt;6  GeV/c. This is significantly larger than the pythia model calculations for p+p collisions. The measured Λ_{c}/D^{0} ratio, as a function of p_{T} and collision centrality, is comparable to the baryon-to-meson ratios for light and strange hadrons in Au+Au collisions. Model calculations including coalescence hadronization for charmed baryon and meson formation reproduce the features of our measured Λ_{c}/D^{0} ratio.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

A program to study the features of the phase diagram, such as a possible critical point, by varying the collision energy ($\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$), is performed at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) facility. Non-monotonic variation with $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ of moments of the net-baryon number distribution, related to the correlation length and the susceptibilities of the system, is suggested as a signature for a critical point. We report the first evidence of a non-monotonic variation in kurtosis $\times$ variance of the net-proton number (proxy for net-baryon number) distribution as a function of $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ with 3.1$\sigma$ significance, for head-on (central) gold-on-gold...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

One of the main observables for CBM are light vector mesons decaying through dilepton channels, that are of the particular importance for the physics program of the experiment. Because of the low branching ratio the key issue for reconstruction of light vector mesons is background suppression. Being a major source of this background, π andγ-conversion have to be carefully studied. The main decay channel of π is a π → γγ channel with a branching ratio of 98.8%. The γ can be reconstructed in the Silicon Tracking System (STS) when it was converted into an electron-positron pair on the material or support structures of the detector: γ → e+e−. To study this decayπ reconstruction through a γ-conversion method was implemented in the KF Particle Finder package for short-lived particle reconstruction.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

For the same ⟨N_{ch}⟩, the v_{1}^{fluc} and v_{3} coefficients are observed to be independent of the collision system, while v_{2} exhibits such a scaling only when normalized by the initial-state eccentricity (ϵ_{2}). The data also show that ln(v_{2}/ϵ_{2}) scales linearly with ⟨N_{ch}⟩^{-1/3}. These measurements provide insight into initial-geometry fluctuations and the role of viscous hydrodynamic attenuation on v_{n} from small to large collision systems.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This measurement would require a muon detector located after the STS. The current design of the muon system consists of 16 detector layers with 100 μm position resolution and 5 absorber layers made of carbon and iron of variable thickness. The structure of the muon detector is following: one sensitive layer is in front of the first absorber, three sensitive layers are between each two absorbers and three — behind last absorber. The vector meson decays were simulated with the PLUTO generator assuming a thermal source with a temperature of 170 MeV. The multiplicities of the signals for central Au+Au collisions at 25 AGeV beam energy were taken from the HSD transport code [1]. The background, consisting mainly of decays of charged pions and kaons, was calculated with the UrQMD event generator for the same system.

While at the two higher energy midcentral collisions the number-of-constituent-quark (NCQ) scaling holds, at 3 GeV the midrapidity $v_{2}$ is negative for all hadrons and the NCQ scaling is absent. In addition, the midrapidity $v_1$ slopes for almost all observed hadrons are found to be positive, implying dominant repulsive baryonic interactions. The features of negative $v_2$ and positive $v_1$ slope at 3 GeV can be reproduced with a baryonic mean-field in transport model calculations. These results imply that in 3 GeV Au+Au collisions, the medium is characterized by baryonic interactions.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
