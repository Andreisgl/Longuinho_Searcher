Institutional Diversity and Stratifi cation Background: From Binary to Uniformity to DiversityEmmaline BexleyThis chapter considers the relationship between institutional diversity and student equity. A Fair Chance for All was composed in the aftermath of the introduction of the unifi ed national system (UNS), a transition in which colleges of advanced education , universities and other higher education providers were merged into a structurally homogeneous collection of 36 universities. Twenty-fi ve years later, the division between vocational and higher education is blurring, as is the division between public and private education. Public Tertiary and Further Education (TAFE) providers and a broad range of private providers are rapidly increasing their delivery of higher education, and mergers, dual sector institutions, and combined degrees are now common. Diversifi cation is likely to continue apace if further deregulatory reforms proceed that allow public institutions to use price as a signalling device. A broad, heterogeneous higher education sector should offer students choice, and an opportunity to fi nd a course that closely suits their particular needs. However, although a preference for heterogeneity has been clearly signalled by the policies of successive governments, the 'landscape' of the differentiated market has itself been unplanned. Very large increases in participation in tertiary education, diversifi cation of provider types and greater institutional differentiation within the university sector itself, has lead to new forms of stratifi cation. No longer can notions of 'equity' centre around a consideration of those who do and do not participate in higher education (the underlying concern of A fair chance for all), but rather who participates where, and how-in short, the status game has shifted from the boundary of the academy to within it. 276 Here, I describe the historical policy shifts that have shaped the sector into its present form, and examines the implications for student equity of a higher education market in which providers are numerous, funded to different extents by different sources, and driven by different institutional missions. In particular, I show how increased participation and institutional differentiation have produced status effects that necessitate a change in approaches to equity, based on a more nuanced understanding of the way social class is expressed through forms of participation. Finally, the chapter considers policy settings that might serve as preconditions for an Australian higher education sector which would see more students pursue a high quality education irrespective of provider type and funding source.Download Free PDFView PDFBringing Cinderella to the ball: constructing a federal system of technical and further education in Australia, 1971-1975Peter W J RushbrookAustralian vocational education has a history dating from the late eighteenth century. As Australian colonies and, later, federated states evolved each constructed its own version of vocational education provision. Generally the systems, consisting of community based or state controlled colleges for the training of operatives, apprenticeships and professional support personnel, were poorly resourced and lacked powerful sponsors to support and promote the education and training of their mostly working class students. By the early 1970s Australian governments had developed commissions to supplement the funding of state-based elementary, secondary and university education systems, even though under the Australian Constitution education remained state-controlled matter. A reformist federal Labor government at the time consolidated elementary, secondary and university funding but neglected to consider, or even acknowledge, the 400 000 vocational education students not covered by these commissions. Following pressure from vocational education teacher unions, among others, the Labor government established the Australian Committee for Technical and Further Education (ACOTAFE) to address the needs of these students. At ACOTAFE’s first meeting on 25 March 1973, the Minister for Education Kim E Beazley said, ‘It will be a renaissance in education when technical and further education cease to be Cinderellas in education. It is the role of your committee to bring Cinderella to her rightful role as princess.’ ACOTAFE was to be chaired by Myer Kangan from the Department of Labour and National Service. The committee’s published outcomes were referred to evermore as the iconic ‘Kangan Report’ rather than TAFE in Australia: report on needs in Technical and Further Education, its formal title. The report gave Australian vocational education a name (TAFE) a philosophy (access to all through lifelong learning) and much needed capital works and infrastructure funding. The paper will outline the circumstances leading to the formation of the committee, its work and its outcomes. Focus will be placed on the influential role of Chairman Kangan in shaping ACOTAFE’s conclusions. A key theme within the paper is the intersection of biography, politics and the economy in shaping policy construction.Download Free PDFView PDFNational Centre For Vocational Education ResearchHigher Education in TAFE: An Issues Paper2009 • Gavin MoodieDownload Free PDFView PDFInternational Journal of Training ResearchThe missing link in Australian tertiary education: short-cycle higher education2003 • Gavin MoodieDownload Free PDFView PDFVET Knowledge Bank - Landmark DocumentsLandmarks in the governance and policy frameworks of Australian VET2019 • Robin RyanAn overview of the governance and policy settings of Australian vocational education and training, linked to the NCVER historical Timeline focusing on Landmark Documents.Download Free PDFView PDFMixed-Sector Tertiary Education: Implications for Self-Accrediting and Other Higher Education Institutions.

In addition there are 73 other tertiary education institutions accredited to offer both vocational and higher education, including 12 public institutes of Technical and Further Education which were established as colleges of vocational education. This paper raises a number of issues about the impact of mixed sector provision on the sectoral divide in tertiary education and the consequences for policy, institutions, teachers and students.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
