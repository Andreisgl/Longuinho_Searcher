However, to date there is no evidence of effectiveness of multicomponent smartphone-based interventions. Utilising a user-centred design approach, we developed a theory-based, multi-dimensional system, PEGASO Fit For Future (PEGASO F4F), which exploits sophisticated game mechanics involving smartphone applications, a smartphone game and activity sensors to motivate teenagers to take an active role in adopting and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. This paper describes the study protocol to assess the feasibility, usability and effectiveness (knowledge/awareness and behavioural change in lifestyle) of the PEGASO system. Methods We are conducting a quasi-experimental controlled cluster trial in 4 sites in Spain, Italy, and UK (England, Scotland) over 6 months. We plan to recruit 525, in a 2:1 basis, teenagers aged 13–16 ...Download Free PDFView PDFTailoring Motivational Mechanisms to Engage Teenagers in Healthy Life-Style: A ConceptMaurizio CaonDownload Free PDFView PDFLecture Notes in Computer ScienceActive Prevention by Motivating and Engaging Teenagers in Adopting Healthier Lifestyles2014 • Renata GuarneriDownload Free PDFView PDFLecture Notes in Computer ScienceIntegrated Architecture for Next-Generation m-Health Services (Education, Monitoring and Prevention) in Teenagers2014 • Gabriela CândeaDownload Free PDFView PDFParticipatory Game Design and Childrenalessandra melonioThis Ph.D. thesis revolves around participatory design with children for the early design of games for them. The Ph.D. research aimed at developing a method and guidelines for participatory game design with children. The Ph.D. work adopted an empirical research approach for developing the method and guidelines.The method draws from prior work, from different research areas, to propose new ideas or relationships between existing constructs. Specifically, different research areas from design and education were cross-fertilised in the method in order to sustain engagement, learning and collaboration during a participatory game design experience, prolonged and fragmented in time. Principles of gamification of learning and gamified probes were used for sustaining engagement throughout the experience, and cooperative learning was introduced for fostering collaboration. The method emerged iteratively through field studies, gathering both qualitative and quantitative data, and it matured through an iterative learning process.This Ph.D. thesis presents firstly the relevant work on which the method breeds, secondly the method itself, and subsequently the major field studies. Finally, the thesis presents guidelines for conducting a participatory game design experience with children, and resulting from findings of field studies.Download Free PDFView PDFGiving teachers a toolkit for enhancing their use of Game-Based Learning. in: Connolly, Thomas, Boyle, Liz (Hg.), Proceedings of the 10th European Conference on Games Based Learning.
