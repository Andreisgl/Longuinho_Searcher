Fast food consumption leads to less consumption of fruits vegetables and milk products. Fast foods are easy to access, tastes good and relatively inexpensive so have created a great desire for the college going girls and the young working youth. As the college going girls are more prone to eat fast foods so, the study was aimed to assess the pattern of fast foods consumption and activity pattern of college going girls. The study was conducted on college going girls (18-23 years) of a private University (The IIS University) in Jaipur city. A total of 100 sample size was selected by the random sampling method. The data was collected by questionnaire method to see the frequency of fast food consumption among the college going girls. It was reported that majority of the samples were consuming the fast food on regular basis and they were less physically active. Though the consumption of fast foods had ill effects on the health of the girls and also their productivity but they are consumed at a very high pace.Save to LibraryDownloadby Gargi Saxena•  3  Nutrition, Public Health Nutrition, Food and NutritionGroup-Based Nutrition Interventions to Promote Health and Mobility in Community-Dwelling Older Adults: A Systematic ReviewObjective: To identify the efficacy of group-based nutrition interventions to increase healthy eating, reduce nutrition risk, improve nutritional status, and improve physical mobility among community-dwelling older adults.Design:... moreObjective: To identify the efficacy of group-based nutrition interventions to increase healthy eating, reduce nutrition risk, improve nutritional status, and improve physical mobility among community-dwelling older adults.Design: Systematic review.

For the current study, FGS villages with a high prevalence of child malnutrition were purposively selected. In each village selected, all households were included, and interviews with a structured questionnaire were conducted in April-May 1998. Incomes were generally low and incidence of poverty was high; 49.6% of the households were under the poverty line income, of which 37.2% were poor and 12.4% were hard core poor. Overall, only 23.2% of heads of households were in agricultural occupations, others being primarily waged workers and petty traders. Livestock rearing was widespread (57.8%), and most households (90.4%) owned at least one motorised vehicle, the most common being the motorcycle.

The estimated retail value of the average FDPIR food package as delivered in FY 2009 was $78.44 per month per FDPIR participant. The report’s retail price estimate probably understates the true retail value of the FDPIR food package because the cost of food from retailers located  on or near Indian reservations is likely above national average retail food costs.Save to LibraryDownloadby Grant Lovellette•  5  Public Health Nutrition, Food and Nutrition, Agriculture and Food Studies, Public Policy - Social Welfare PolicyFamily Child Care Home Providers’ Self-Reported Nutrition and Physical Activity Practices, Self-Efficacy, Barriers, and Knowledge: Baseline Findings from Happy Healthy HomesObjective: Describe nutrition and physical activity practices, nutrition self-efficacy and barriers, and food program knowledge within Family Child Care Homes (FCCH), and differences by staffing.

However, studies in adults have suggested beneficial effects of protein intake on blood pressure (BP) and lipid profile. Whether dietary protein intake is associated with cardiovascular and metabolic health in children is unclear. Therefore, we aimed to systematically review the evidence on the associations of protein intake with BP, insulin sensitivity and blood lipids in children. We searched the databases Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central and PubMed for interventional and observational studies in healthy children up to the age of 18 years, in which associations of total, animal and/or vegetable protein intake with one or more of the following outcomes were reported: BP; measures of insulin sensitivity; cholesterol levels; or TAG levels.

This review discusses REM-OSA definitions, its cardiometabolic correlates, associated comorbidities and treatment, and addresses diagnostic ambiguities and therapeutic pitfalls. Recent findings Current evidence indicates that REM-OSA is prevalent among younger age groups and women and is independently associated with cardiometabolic complications, particularly hypertension, metabolic complications such as insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. However, currently, there is no consensus on the accepted diagnostic criteria for REM-OSA. Available data suggest that adherence to positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy in patients with REM-OSA is suboptimal. Moreover, the currently accepted criteria for good adherence to PAP therapy of 4 h/night, 70% of the days may not be suitable for REM-OSA, as it will not cover most of the REM sleep periods. In addition, further research is needed to assess the impact of REM-OSA treatment on cardiometabolic outcomes. Summary Patients with REM-OSA are at an increased risk of cardiometabolic complications. A high index of suspicion is needed to diagnose this disorder, and close follow-up is required to enhance adherence to therapy.Save to LibraryDownloadby Rouf  Pirzada and +1Ahmed S BaHammam•  12  Public Health Nutrition, Obesity, Diabetes, Cardiovascular diseaseCommunities that cook: a systematic review of the effectiveness and appropriateness of interventions to introduce adults to home cooking [IOE Research Briefing N°50]This review explores cooking courses in the UK in the context of promoting ‘home-cooking’ community based courses for adults.

O Instituto Politécnico da Guarda (IPG) possui um total de 2692 estudantes, que todos os dias fazem escolhas alimentares. Dada a sua importância, este estudo tem por objetivo avaliar: a) as escolhas preferências/seleções alimentares dos estudantes; b) o local do seu consumo e c) a sua composição corporal. Para tal, recorreu-se à realização de um inquérito por questionário, denominado “Hábitos Alimentares da Comunidade IPG”, dirigido a todos os estudantes das quatro unidades orgânicas. Responderam ao questionário cerca de 14% dos estudantes do IPG. Após a análise dos resultados, conclui-se que seria importante sensibilizar os estudantes para a prática de uma alimentação saudável para tal deveriam ser realizadas várias ações de formação nas respetivas escolas, rastreios e até mesmo algumas competições de forma a que as boas escolhas alimentares se realizem de forma motivada e não obrigatória. Como os estudantes dão muita importância às cantinas, esta poderia ser um veículo importante para promover os bons hábitos alimentares.Save to LibraryDownloadby Flávio Simão and +1Vitor Roque•  9  Public Health Nutrition, Higher Education, Food and Nutrition, Higher Education ManagementSchool Nutrition Policies: Shared and Complementary Perspectives of Lebanese Key StakeholdersSave to LibraryDownloadby Sima Hamadeh, PhD.•  3  Public Health Nutrition, Public Health Policy, Stakeholder EngagementSocio-economic status and health awareness are associated with choice of cooking oil in Costa RicaSave to LibraryDownloadby Hannia Campos•  26  Public Health Nutrition, Public Health, Costa Rica, Urban HealthGender Disparities in the Prevalence of Undernutrition and the Higher Risk among the Young Women of Indian TribesPLoS ONESave to Libraryby Dr. Subhendu   K Acharya•  32  Anthropology, Biological Anthropology, Medical Anthropology, NutritionHow to stop public health conferences becoming trade fairsPage 1.

Therefore, the current study was performed to assess information regarding the use of sport drinks among 440 athletes (23.5±4.62 years of age) in Kano Nigeria. Data were collected using a selfadministered, structured and pretested questionnaire. The results indicated that the frequency of sport drinks consumption was higher among male athletes and in those who did not have breakfast on a regular basis, ever smoked cigarettes and drank alcoholic beverages compared with their female counterparts. Athletes who had ‘ever’ tried a sport drink were significantly higher (p&lt;0.05) than those who had ‘never’ tasted the drink. Main reasons for using such drinks for regular users varied across the selected groups of athletes and included obtaining energy and boosting performance while doing sport.

Costs were calculated by (i) estimating the prevalence of DRM in health-care settings derived from age-standardised comparisons between available Irish data and large-scale UK surveys and (ii) applying relevant costs from official sources to estimates of health-care utilisation by adults with DRM. No attempt has been made to estimate separately the costs of DRM and any associated disease, since each can be a cause or consequence of the other.

This study was on the pharmacology of its seed in diabetes treatment. The study therefore suggested the histopathologic effects of P. americana seed extracts on the liver and kidney of alloxan-induced diabetic albino rats. One hundred gram (100g) of the sample was extracted with 1L of water using the maceration method. The rats were induced with diabetes by intraperitonal (IP) injection of 150mg/kg body weight of alloxan monohydrate solution and treated with different doses of the extract (200 and300 mg/kg.b.wt.) and insulin for 21 days. On Day 21 of the treatment regime, the animals were sacrificed and the necessary organs (liver and kidney) were harvested. The harvested organs were processed according to paraffin wax embedding technique, sectioned at 5μmand stained by the haematoxylin and eosin for light microscopy. Results obtained in alloxan-treated rats showed evidence of necrosis, vasculation and infiltration of the hepatocytes by inflammatory cells. In the kidney, there was mild infiltration by inflammatory cells in alloxan-treated rats. However, treatment of the alloxan-treated rats with extracts of P. Americana restored the histoarchitecture of both the damaged liver and kidney to normal as the control rats suggesting that P. Americana extracts reversed the histopathological damage that occurred in alloxan-induced diabetic rats. It is concluded this study seems to provides a pharmacological basis for the traditional use of P. americana seeds extracts in the management of Diabetes mellitus and raises the possibility of its potential clinical usefulness.Save to LibraryDownloadby Nonso C Ejiofor•  7  Public Health Nutrition, Drug Discovery, Clinical Biochemistry, Medicinal plants and natural productsEvaluation of under- and overreporting of energy intake in the 24-hour diet recalls in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)Save to LibraryDownloadby Androniki Naska•  14  Public Health Nutrition, Diet, Public Health, HumansNutritional assessment of pre-school children in rural villages of the family dynamics, lifestyles and nutrition study (1997-2001) I.

However, vegetarians, especially vegans, are at a high risk for developing some nutrient deficiencies, especially vitamin B12 and iron. These nutrients play critical role in pregnancy and thus may impact fetal development and neonatal birth weight. To date, very few studies assessed birth weight among children born to mothers adhering to vegetarian diets [1,2].Breastfeeding is the most desirable feeding pattern for infants. Breastfeeding is especially important in the first 6 months of life. Breastfed children have lower risk of some health conditions such as otitis media, asthma or atopic dermatitis [3]. Data on breastfeeding patterns among vegetarian mothers are almost non-existent.Save to LibraryDownloadby Pawlak Roman and +1Enliven: Journal of Dietetics  Research and Nutrition•  21  Nutrition and Dietetics, Nutrition, Public Health Nutrition, Food and NutritionTACO Tabela Brasileira de Composição de AlimentosSave to LibraryDownloadby Nelson Lança•Public Health NutritionMBPFEste é um manual de boas práticas onde se ensina alguns dos maisimportantes requisitos de higiene, órgãos e documentações sanitárias, necessáriospara o pleno funcionamento de uma lanchonete.

Risk of aflatoxin contaminationof commodities in the world, especially in Africa is increasing. Aflatoxin can occur in a wide range of important commodities, including cereals, nuts,spices, figs and dried fruit. AFB1, AFB2, AFG1, AFG1, AFM1 and AFM2 are the most common type of aflatoxin. Aflatoxin contamination of agriculturalcommodities poses considerable risk to human and livestock health and economic losses. Exposure to aflatoxin leads to several health-related conditionsin human including acute and chronic aflatoxicosis, immune suppression, liver cancer, liver cirrhosis, stunted growth in children and many others.Aflatoxins are detected from several crops especially from maize and groundnut. Several researches show that AFB1 is the most common aflatoxin inthe world from most commodities at a very much higher level. AFM1 was also detected greater than the standard from milk and milk products. Thisindicates that a lot of developing countries people are at danger of aflatoxin contamination. Lack of awareness on aflatoxin contamination increases therisk of damage to human and animals. High economic losses due to aflatoxin occur in the country crops and animals.Save to LibraryDownloadby Crimson Publishers NTNF•  5  Public Health Nutrition, Food Engineering, Food and Nutrition, Food MicrobiologyUrban v. suburban perceptions of the neighbourhood food environment as correlates of adolescent food purchasingSave to LibraryDownloadby Mary Hearst•  19  Perception, Public Health Nutrition, Nonparametric Statistics, ObesityAssociations among the food environment, diet quality and weight status in Cree children in QuébecSave to LibraryDownloadby Shauna Downs•  21  Public Health Nutrition, Obesity, Diet, QuebecThe Joy of Cooking Too Much: 70 Years of Calorie Increases in Classic RecipesThe average calorie increase in 18 classic American recipes has increased 35.2 percent per serving over the past 70 years.

Part of this is due to the use of more caloric ingredients and part to serving sizes that showed small increases in the late 1940s and early 1960s, but showed a 33.2% increase since1996.  The calories and portion sizes of classic recipes may reflect prevailing tastes and norms.  Yet they may also establish or reinforce exaggerated norms in others, such as new families.  Although this study is largely descriptive, it does imply a prescriptive recommendation for families.  The serving size and calorie composition of classic recipes need to be downsized to counteract growing waistlines.Save to LibraryDownloadby Brian Wansink•  8  Public Health Nutrition, Public Health, Cooking Residue Analysis, Cooking and Food Preparation (archaeology)Does parental migration have any impact on nutritional disorders among left-behind children in Bangladesh?ObjectiveRates of migration have increased substantially in recent years and so has the number of left-behind children (LBC).

We investigated the impact of parental migration on nutritional disorders of LBC in Bangladesh.DesignWe analysed data from the nationally representative cross-sectional Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey 2012–2013. Child stunting, wasting and underweight were used as measures of nutritional disorders. Descriptive statistics were used to describe characteristics of the respondents and to compare nutritional outcomes based on status of parental migration. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to examine the associations between parental migration and child nutritional disorders.SettingBangladesh.ParticipantsData of 23 402 children (aged &lt;5 years), their parents and households.ResultsIn the unadjusted models, parental migration was found significantly protective for stunting, wasting and underweight – both separately and jointly.

The drug has questionable nutrients, and could even be toxic. Half a carrot, a drop of oil or a few ground nuts will give much more nutrients than spirulina. This substance is neither certified as a drug under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 or as a food under Food Safety and Standards Authority of India. Is it possible that attempts are made to do a clinical trial with this substance which is not even indigenous to India?

The aim of this case-control study was to assess possible associations between the consumptionof different fast foods, sweets and beverages and CRC risk in a Jordanian population. Methods: Two hundred andtwenty diagnosed CRC cases and 281 controls were enrolled. Diet history was obtained using a validated quantitativequestionnaire. Results: Consumption of some types of fast food, and particularly falafel, was associated with an increasedrisk of developing CRC. Elevated risk was found for potato and corn chips with an AOR of 4.36 (95%CI: 1.24-15.28)for daily consumption and 3.33 (95%CI: 1.00-11.11) for ≥5 servings/week. Consuming 1-2 or >5 servings per week offried potatoes or 2-3 servings per week of chicken in sandwiches also increased the risk while exposure to fresh tomatojuice and hot pepper sauce on a monthly basis appeared to exert a protective effect. Conclusions: Consumption of friedfast food items was significantly linked with an increased risk of developing CRC in JordanSave to LibraryDownloadby Kamal E Bani-Hani•  6  Nutrition, Public Health Nutrition, Food and Nutrition, Cancer ResearchEnergy drinks: pattern of consumption among university students and associated factorsPurpose-Energy drink (ED) consumption has become a common trend nowadays and sometimes considered as a showcase of modern lifestyle, especially among youth.

Hence, the purpose of this paper is to study ED consumption pattern among university students and identify the determinants for their preference for such drinks. Design/methodology/approach-This cross-sectional study was conducted among 400 students from various departments of Jashore University of Science and Technology, Bangladesh. Findings-About 52.3 percent of the students were between 21 and 23 years, and half of them were male. More than half (53 percent) of the students had consumed ED at least once in their lifetime. Only 22.1 percent of all consumers had knowledge of the ingredients of ED, and 4.3 percent did not know their negative impact. Bivariate analysis was performed to identify the variables significantly associated with ED consumption among students.

A cross-sectional study on a sample of households with at least one child aged 0-2 years. In a one-to-one interview, participants completed an adapted Arabic version of the HFIAS. In order to evaluate the validity of the HFIAS, basic sociodemographic information, anthropometric measurements of the mother and child, and dietary intake data of the child were obtained. In order to examine reproducibility, the HFIAS was re-administered after 3 months. Rural Lebanon. Mother and child pairs (n 150). Factor analysis of HFIAS items revealed two factors: &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39;insufficient food quality&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39; and &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39;insufficient food quantity&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39;. Using Pearson&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39;s correlation, food insecurity was inversely associated with mother&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39;s and father&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39;s education levels, number of cars and electrical appliances in the household, income, weight-for-age and length-for-age of the child and the child&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39;s dietary adequacy. In contrast, mother&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39;s BMI and crowding index were positively associated with food insecurity scores (P &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt; 0·05 for all correlations). Cronbach&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39;s α of the scale was 0·91. A moderate correlation was observed between the two administrations of the questionnaire (intra-class correlation = 0·58; P &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt; 0·05). Our findings indicated that the adapted Arabic version of the HFIAS is a valid and reliable tool to assess food insecurity in rural Lebanon, lending further evidence to the utility of the HFIAS in assessing food insecurity in culturally diverse populations.Save to LibraryDownloadby nahla  hwalla•Public Health NutritionThe motivational and informational basis of attitudes toward foods with health claimsSave to LibraryDownloadby Iris Žeželj•  3  Health Psychology, Public Health Nutrition, Attitudes (Social Psychology)NextLast »Related TopicsNutrition and DieteticsFollowFollowingHuman NutritionFollowFollowingFood and NutritionFollowFollowingNutritionFollowFollowingPublic HealthFollowFollowingClinical NutritionFollowFollowingNutritional Status AssessmentFollowFollowingNutritional EpidemiologyFollowFollowingEpidemiologyFollowFollowingSports NutritionFollowFollowing 71.6 million researchers use this site every month.
