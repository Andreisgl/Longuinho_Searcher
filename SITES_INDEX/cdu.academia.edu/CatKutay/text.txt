The parameters in this language are updated by the agents in the individual or group models and used to select optimal feedback to provide to students learning activities. While the agents discussed have been developed within a specific software system, the language provides a generic formal approach to agent development in the do-main of learning using groupware. The domain considered is an open learning environment where stu-dents are solving an open-ended problem. In contrast to an Intelligent Tutoring System, there are no correct answers, only the development of concepts and processes that improve the learning outcome. How-ever, given the computer is still the mediator in the communication, we aim to provide scaffolding for the learning that takes place.

This system was extended by a series of rule-based agents which aims to scaffold the particular learning needs of the domain. The software was developed for a software engineering workshop in which students are asked to produce a detailed design of a system from a given set of requirements. This paper looks at the development of a Blackboard-style User Model incorporating historical data to support the initiation of the rule-based agents, plus the use of weighted decisions for co-ordination.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The protocols and practices as used today and in the past by Indigenous communities are presented and discussed in relation to their relevance to a personalised system of knowledge sharing in modern organisational cultures. This research focuses on user models, knowledge acquisition and integration of data for constructivist learning in a networked repository of organisational knowledge. The data collected in the repository is searched to provide collections of up-to-date and relevant material for training in a Virtual Learning Environment. The aim is to improve knowledge collection and sharing in a team environment. This knowledge can then be collated into a story or workflow that represents the present knowledge in the organisation.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In this paper we present the process and technology to develop an online system to share multiple experiences of Aboriginal Culture in NSW, Australia within a social-constructivist framework. The focus of the material is the Kinship system used for thousands of years in this region. This topic exemplifies the knowledge used to maintain societies and provides the setting for social conflict with the non-Aboriginal people who came here in recent history. We are using stories from the community to augment the learning material. Using innovative web services, teachers can select the stories that are relevant to their course, and link these within a range of scenarios being developed. The scenarios enable students to select the way they relate to the characters, listen to their stories, and become aware of their own role in the community.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

One of the team members (Kutay) was also a project team member on the ALTC-funded project ‘Exploring PBL in Indigenous Australian Studies’, which has developed a teaching and learning process (PEARL) for Indigenous Australian studies. In this article, we present the ‘Indigenous On-Line Cultural Teaching and Sharing’ project as an exemplar of this teaching process. The project turns a highly successful interactive kinship workshop into an interactive online experience for all students and staff of the University of Sydney. The project is developing a sharing portal for Aboriginal people in New South Wales (NSW) to incorporate their stories and experiences of cultural, historical and educational issues within a knowledge-sharing workshop.

Humans tutors make this process easier by asking students what they are thinking about a topic, then relate the answer to this stage or context of their learning. Hence the first Computer Supported Learning systems were based on a tutorial question-answer format. Since then research has branched out into Learner Modelling and Intelligent Agents to support learning in more open systems. This article looks at computers emulating mentors who analyse the student&amp;#39;s documented activities to provide feedback. The activities are analysed using a methodology that looks at the Human-Computer-Human Interface, and a pattern structure is developed which is based on an ontology of group learning. Agents are designed and implemented using this structure to analyse synchronous and asynchronous group learning processes and to provide feedback. The ontology used in this research is based on the structure provided by Activity Theory where technology plays the role of mediator in the context of student actions.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The resources are to assist learning a specific set of cultures, those of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities in Australia, using stories uploaded onto a web site. The work is aimed at cultural preservation through non-linear digital stories, and re-presenting it in educational settings. By enabling the community contributors to tag their artefacts according to themes, relationships, location and language we can provide a way for the learner-user to select relevant stories to their learning experience. The three learning environment interfaces, combined with the contributor’s tagging of their story, provides the interconnection between stories and the learning path for the users.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
