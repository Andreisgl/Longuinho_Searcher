To understand recent changes and model future projections of temperature, we need to quantify climate variability during the last several centuries prior to and since the industrial revolution. Because of its importance in modulating climate through changes in albedo, carbon-sink feedbacks, and the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC), Arctic paleoenvironments are particularly important for understanding climate variability . Approximately 70% of the Arctic Ocean is ice-covered throughout the year, but recent global warming since the mid-19th century has diminished the sea ice extent, changing carbon uptake by the Arctic Ocean . The increased fresh-water flux from both glacial melt and the melting sea ice reduces surface salinity and increases the solubility of CO 2 . As the cold water from the Arctic Ocean contributes to the formation of the North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW),...See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated Papers Arctic, Antarctic, and Alpine Research 47(2), 375-387Does the coralline alga Leptophytum fœcundum (Kjellman) capture paleoenvironmental variability in the Arctic Ocean ?2015 • Andreas KronzDownload Free PDFView PDFPalaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, PalaeoecologyReconstructing mid- to high-latitude marine climate and ocean variability using bivalves, coralline algae, and marine sediment cores from the Northern Hemisphere2011 • Steffen HetzingerDownload Free PDFView PDFGeologyCoralline red algae as high-resolution climate recorders2008 • M.

Mg/Ca, Li/Ca, Ba/Ca were measured on Lithophyllum yemenense 30 from Balhaf (Gulf of Aden) using Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry 31 (LA-ICP-MS), and Mg/Ca ratio oscillation has been used to reconstruct the chronology (34 years). 32 Oscillations of element rates corresponding to the algal growth between 1974 and 2008 were 33 compared with recorded climate and oceanographic variability. During this period the sea surface 34 temperatures (SST) in Balhaf recorded a warming trend of 0.55°C corresponding to an increase in 35 Mg and Li contents in the algal thallus of 2.1 mol % and 1.87 μmol % respectively. L. yemenense 36 recorded decadal SST variability by Li/Ca, and the influence of the Pacific El-Niño Southern 37 Oscillation (ENSO) on the NW Indian Ocean climate system by Ba/Ca.

This group was believed to be exclusively marine until 2016, when the first freshwater coralline algae Pneophyllum cetinaensis was discovered in the Cetina River, southern Croatia. While several studies investigated the element compositions of marine coralline algal thalli, no information is yet available for the freshwater species. Using XRD, LA-ICP-MS and nano indentation, this study presents the first living low-Mg calcite coralline algae with Mg concentrations ten times lower than is common for the average marine species. Despite the lower Mg concentrations, hardness and elastic modulus (1.71 ± 1.58 GPa and 29.7 ± 18.0 GPa, respectively) are in the same range as other marine coralline algae, possibly due to other biogenic impurities. When compared to marine species, Ba/Ca values were unusually low, even though Ba concentrat...Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of PhycologyElemental variability in the coralline alga Lithophyllum yemenense as an archive of past climate in the Gulf of Aden (NW Indian Ocean)2017 • Annalisa CaragnanoDownload Free PDFView PDFPalaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, PalaeoecologyHigh-resolution analysis of trace elements in crustose coralline algae from the North Atlantic and North Pacific by laser ablation ICP-MS2011 • Steffen Hetzinger, Andreas Kronz, Robert SteneckDownload Free PDFView PDFPalaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, PalaeoecologyCoralline algal growth-increment widths archive North Atlantic climate variability2011 • Steffen HetzingerOver the past decade coralline algae have increasingly been used as archives of paleoclimate information. Encrusting coralline algae, which deposit annual growth increments in a high Mg-calcite skeleton, are amongst the longest-lived shallow marine organisms. In fact, a live-collected plant has recently been shown to have lived for at least 850years based on radiometric dating.
