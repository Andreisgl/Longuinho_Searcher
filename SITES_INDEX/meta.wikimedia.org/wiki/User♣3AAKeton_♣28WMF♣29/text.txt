While in that role, she worked with the Wikimedia Foundation to establish the Wikimedia Endowment, a permanent source of funding to support the Wikimedia projects and mission in perpetuity. She also served as Head of Tides Foundation, led People Operations and served as the CEO of Tides Advocacy, the policy affiliate in the Tides family of organizations. Before her work at Tides, Amanda worked for Ernst & Young providing nonprofit organizations with consulting, advisory, and compliance services.
