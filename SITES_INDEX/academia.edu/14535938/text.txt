Whether this lack of universal behavior is due to the bursting patterns in rainfall intensity or the alternation between long dry periods and highly clustered wet phases (or both) remains an open issue. To progress on a narrower scope of this problem, the effects of intermittency originating from rainfall occurrence are first separated from rainfall intermittency induced by intensity variability. Across five climatic regimes considered here, it was shown that the rainfall occurrence process (OP) exhibits (1) a near-constant spectral slope, (2) a near-constant clustering exponent, and (3) a probability density function of dry phases displaying a power law behavior with an exponent b % 1.5, consistent with other studies for timescales commensurate with frontal and storm systems. Also for the OP, the scaling exponents of the normalized higher...See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersWater Resources ResearchAn entropic-stochastic representation of rainfall intermittency: The origin of clustering and persistence2006 • Demetris KoutsoyiannisDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Geophysical ResearchEvidence of dynamic scaling in space-time rainfall1999 • Victor SapozhnikovAs in any evolving process, including rainfall, variability in space and time are not independent of each other but depend in a way particular to the process at hand. Understanding and quantifying the space-time dependences in a process over a range of scales is not always easy because these dependences may be hidden under complex patterns with pronounced statistical variability at all scales. In this paper, we report our efforts to understand the spatiotemporal organization of rainfall at a range of scales (2 km to 20 km in space and 10 min to several hours in time) and explore the existence of simple relationships which might connect the rate of rainfall pattern evolution at small space and time scales to that at larger scales. Specifically, we seek to understand whether there exist space-time transformations under which these relationships can be parameterized in a simple scale-invariant framework. On the basis of analysis of several tropical convective storms in Darwin, Australia, we found that the rate of evolution of rainfall remains invariant under space-time transformations of the form t~Lz (dynamic scaling). In other words, the dependence of the statistical structure of rainfall on space (L) and time (t) can be reduced to a single parameter t/Lz, where z is called the dynamic scaling exponent. The space-time organization in rainfall, apart from being interesting in its own right, permits the development of simple rainfall downscaling schemes which incorporate both spatial and temporal persistence.Download Free PDFView PDFChaos: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Nonlinear ScienceScaling of extreme rainfall areas at a planetary scale2015 • Upmanu LallDownload Free PDFView PDFScale-dependence of persistence in precipitation recordsYannis Markonis, Demetris KoutsoyiannisLong-term persistence or Hurst-Kolmogorov (HK) behaviour has been identified in many hydroclimatic records 1. Such time series are intriguing because they are the hallmark of multi-scale dynamical processes that govern the system from which they arise 2. They are also highly relevant for water resource managers because these systems exhibit persistent, e.g. multi-decadal, mean shifts or extremes clustering that must be included into any long-term drought management strategy. During the last years the growing number of paleoclimatic reconstructions allowed to further investigate the long term statistical properties of climate 3, 4 and understand their implications to the observed change 5. Recently, the consistency of the proxy data for precipitation was strongly doubted, when their persistence property was compared to the corresponding estimates of instrumental records and model results 6, 7. The latter suggest that droughts or extremely wet periods occur less frequently than depicted in the paleoclimatic reconstructions. Here, we show how this could be the outcome of a varying scaling law and present some evidence supporting that proxy records can be reliable descriptors of the long-term precipitation variability. Earlier studies have already highlighted that annual precipitation records seem to exhibit no or short-term persistence when the time scale is small 8, 9, 10 , while in larger time periods HK behaviour emerges 11, 12, 13. It appears that rainfall variability could be affected by different physical mechanisms, which develop to two quite different auto-correlation structures; one for 1 to 10 years (small scales) and another one for multi-decadal intervals and beyond (large scales). An example of such behaviour is the temperature variation in a two-layer thin film system studied by Van Vliet 14 and suggested also by Pelletier 15 as a possible description of the global air temperature variability behaviour, which also encompasses the role of the oceans to atmospheric long-term fluctuations. Following the same idea, we investigated the hypothesis of white noise or Markov-type behaviour of precipitation below the decadal time resolution and HK behaviour at larger time scales. Although the HK behaviour has a strong physical basis, as the outcome of entropy production maximization 16 , it has been shown that a small sample size might mask the HK behaviour 3. Thus, to reliably estimate moderate values of H (0.7-0.8) the sample size should be of at least 100 (see Methods; Figures S1 & S2). Some of the aforementioned studies 6, 10 used time series with record length close to this number, and they could be prone to H underestimation, especially when studies of longer instrumental records show that H can rise above 0.7 17, 18.
