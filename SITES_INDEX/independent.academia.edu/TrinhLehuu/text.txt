Serum HCV RNA and GBV-C/HGV RNA were detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). HBsAg, HCV antibodies, and GBV-C/HGV RNA were detected in 139 (47%), 69 (23%), and ten (3%) subjects, respectively, often accompanied by elevated serum levels of alanine aminotransferase. HBsAg and HCV antibodies or HCV antibodies and GBV-C/HGV RNA were detectable simultaneously in 8% and 2% of the patients, respectively. In the inhabitants, HBsAg, HCV antibodies, and GBV-C/HGV RNA were found in 51 (5.7%), nine (1.0%), and 11 (1.2%) subjects, respectively. Thus, the prevalence of HBsAg, HCV antibodies, and GBV-C/HGV RNA was significantly higher in liver disease patients than those in the general population. In the samples from 69 patients and nine inhabitants who were seropositive for HCV antibodies, HCV RNA was detectable in 42 (61%) and 4 (44%), respectively. In patients with liver disease, ten belonged to HCV genotype 1a, ten to HCV 1b, three to HCV 2a, four to HCV 2b, and two to HCV 3a by PCR with genotype-specific primers. Nine patients had mixed genotypes, and the remaining four were not classified. Of the GBV-C/HGV RNA-positive individuals, two patients and two inhabitants were positive for HBsAg, while none of the residents had HCV antibodies, although six HCV antibodies (60%) and four HCV RNA (40%) were found in patients. When a phylogenetic tree of GBV-C/HGV was constructed based on the nucleotide sequences, the 21 isolates were classified into at least two genotypes; four isolates belonged to G2, and 17 to G3. The results indicate that in Ho Chi Minh HCV infection prevails with broad distribution of genotypes together with HBV infection among patients with liver disease. This study suggests that GBV-C/HGV infection occurs independently in the two different districts in association with HCV infection.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

One of the blind... more Symbol timing and carrier frequency synchronization are crucial to OFDM systems. One of the blind synchronization methods is the cyclic prefix (CP) based maximum likelihood (ML) symbol timing and carrier frequency synchronization which correlates the cyclic prefix and the last part of the OFDM symbol. However, the performance of this method is seriously reduced in the time-variant multipath channel. In this paper, we propose a new CP which has two parts. One part is a copy of the head of the last symbol and the other part is a copy of the tail of that symbol. Both parts have the length of half of the CP. As a result of this new CP, the starting time of one OFDM symbol is allowed to fall into its effective period (the absolute value of the symbol timing error should be smaller than CP/2). The performance of OFDM systems is improved significantly with this new CPSave to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Among them, compound 1 showed the most potent inhibition with rate of 28.06 ± 0.21% at a concentration of 100 μM. Compounds 2 and 8 exhibited weak activities. These results suggest that compound 1 might contribute to the ability of P. major to inhibit the activity of angiotensin I- converting enzyme.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
