For up-to-date information and papers, see https://hcommons.org/members/hcameron/In keeping with his research interests (including movement, social networks, geography and imperialism), Hamish Cameron is an itinerant scholar hailing from a far flung colony of a former empire. His dissertation (USC Classics, 2014) examines the representation of Northern Mesopotamia as a border region in Imperial Roman geographic writing of the first four centuries CE. In 2011 he completed a Graduate Certificate in Geographic Information Science and Technology at the USC Spatial Sciences Institute. He received his MA from the University of Canterbury, New Zealand in 2006 with a thesis titled The Beginnings of Roman Imperialism in Cilicia: Control, Policy and Response in the Second and First Centuries BC. Hamish participated in the Eastern Boeotia Archaeological Project 2007 and 2009 survey seasons, the International Spring School on the introduction of new gods in Greece and Rome at the University of Erfurt and the first International Conference on Rough Cilicia, both in 2007.Supervisors: Claudia Moatti, Christelle Fischer-Bovet, Kevin Van Bladel, Ramzi Rouighi, and William G.

This inter-imperial borderland betweenthe Roman Empire and the Arsacid and Sasanid Empires providedfertile ground for Roman geographical writers to articulate their ideasabout space, boundaries, and imperial power. By examining thesegeographical descriptions, Hamish Cameron shows how each authorconstructed an image of Mesopotamia in keeping with the goals andcontext of their own work, while collectively creating a vision ofMesopotamia as a borderland space of movement, inter-imperialtension, and global engagement.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

As the only frontier over which Rome faced an empire of similar size and power, the Mesopotamian frontier zone between the Roman and Iranian empires, that is, upper Mesopotamia, the region between the Euphrates and Tigris rivers, south of the Taurus mountains and north of Parthian and Sasanian Babylonia, was arguably Rome&#39;s most important frontier, yet its representation in Roman intellectual production is seldom studied. This dissertation examines geographic descriptions of that region written in the first four centuries CE, including Strabo, Pliny the Elder, Claudius Ptolemy, and Ammianus Marcellinus as well as the anonymous Expositio Totius Mundi et Gentium. It examines the sources of their geographic knowledge to show the influence of Aramaic, Iranian, Hellenistic, and Roman ...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The range of issues and contexts related to the various ways in which Greek and Roman sculpture has been destroyed and re-used from the third century A.D. onwards cannot be exhausted within the limited space of a book, no matter how much inclusive this might be. It is the reviewer’s belief in the need for a more reflective and multi-disciplinary approach to these matters. Subjects that deserve further investigation are the national or local contexts of the ancient destruction and reuse of statuary in a range of relevant practices related to the reconstruction of a complete picture of the afterlives of these objects during Late Antiquity and beyond. This would enable a thorough examination of the sociocultural discourses surrounding these practices. The extent to which these practices intersect with and produce distinctive attitudes towards the late-antique language of aesthetics, and how the latter emerge from this absorption of ancient art with new perceptions and practices, could also provide an important topic for further work.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
