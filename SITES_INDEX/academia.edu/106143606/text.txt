Using a novel database of 45,813 first records of 16,926 established alien species, we show that the annual rate of first records worldwide has increased during the last 200 years, with 37% of all first records reported most recently (1970-2014). Inter-continental and inter-taxonomic variation can be largely attributed to the diaspora of European settlers in the nineteenth century and to the acceleration in trade in the twentieth century. For all taxonomic groups, the increase in numbers of alien species does not show any sign of saturation and most taxa even show increases in the rate of first records over time. This highlights that past efforts to mitigate invasions have not been effective enough to keep up with increasing globalization.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersSeebens et al 2017 NatComm.pdfSven  BacherDownload Free PDFView PDFBiological Invasions in South AfricaSouth Africa’s Pathways of Introduction and Dispersal and How They Have Changed Over TimeDavina SaccaggiDownload Free PDFView PDFresumos do...Diretrizes para melhorar a integração do projeto e da produção de empreendimentos da construção civil por meio do sistema Last Planner®2019 • bruno bragatoDownload Free PDFView PDFBiological Invasions in South AfricaSouth Africa as a Donor of Alien AnimalsNatasha  KrugerDownload Free PDFView PDFBiodiversityInvasive alien species and biodiversity: impacts and managementSandra CitterioDownload Free PDFView PDFNature Ecology & EvolutionGlobal hotspots and correlates of alien species richness across taxonomic groups2017 • Christine CasalDownload Free PDFView PDFNature CommunicationsThe global loss of floristic uniquenessAleksandr EbelRegional species assemblages have been shaped by colonization, speciation and extinction over millions of years. Humans have altered biogeography by introducing species to new ranges. However, an analysis of how strongly naturalized plant species (i.e. alien plants that have established self-sustaining populations) affect the taxonomic and phylogenetic uniqueness of regional floras globally is still missing. Here, we present such an analysis with data from native and naturalized alien floras in 658 regions around the world. We find strong taxonomic and phylogenetic floristic homogenization overall, and that the natural decline in floristic similarity with increasing geographic distance is weakened by naturalized species. Floristic homogenization increases with climatic similarity, which emphasizes the importance of climate matching in plant naturalization. Moreover, floristic homogenization is greater between regions with current or past administrative relationships, indicating that...Download Free PDFView PDFAmbioNon-native vascular flora of the Arctic: Taxonomic richness, distribution and pathways2019 • Stefanie Ickert-BondDownload Free PDFView PDFNeoBiotaMulti-taxa inventory of naturalized species in Chile2020 • Alfredo SaldañaHere we present a multi-taxa inventory of naturalized alien species recorded on continental Chile and adjacent marine habitats, including eight taxonomic groups. We identified 1,122 species. These comprise 790 vascular plants (terrestrial and aquatic); 31 nonvascular plants [Bryophyta (mosses), Marchantiophyta (liverworts) and Anthocerotophyta (hornworts)]; 18 marine and freshwater macro and micro algae; 71 fungi; 39 terrestrial vertebrates (amphibians, reptiles, mammals and birds); 108 insects; 37 marine and freshwater invertebrates and vertebrates (6 polychaetes, 3 mollusks and 28 Pisces); and 28 terrestrial gastropods. For all taxonomic groups, naturalized species were found to mainly be distributed in regions with Mediterranean and temperate climates, with few at either extreme of the country. The invasion curves show that naturalized species first underwent a positive increment, followed by an apparent plateau phase, mainly in vascular plants, insects and vertebrates.
