Legal scholars have embraced the animal turn, blurring the once sovereign boundaries between persons and objects, recognising nonhuman beings as legal subjects. The zoonotic origins of the Covid-19 pandemic stress the urgency of establishing ‘global animal law’ and deconstructing anthropocentrism. To this end, it is vital to also consider the extensive premodern legal history that humans share with other animals. Over 200 so-called animal trials have been documented in premodern Europe. In these proceedings, certain nonhuman animals—particularly domestic pigs—were prosecuted, often resulting in their capital punishment or anathema.

These Archetypes are ingrained in the collective unconscious of humanity and create their collective representations; representations that are observable in a significant number of people and civilizations. These representations are the same images, patterns, and mental symbols that revolve around a specific axis and provide a general perspective for humans. Jung considered the mother archetype to be the most important one. The mother archetype is like the earth, both nurturing and devouring, and is the source of all spiritual development. Therefore, the mother archetype is a bipolar archetype: the greatest mother containing infinite nurturing, care, and support, and the very bad mother (terrifying, horrible) representing fear, suffocation, death, and captivity. Animals such as cow, snake, and serpent are representations and symbols that embody these two main meanings of the mother archetype. "Cow" symbolizes nurturing, rebirth, and fertility, while snakes and dragons symbolize devouring, destruction, and anger. This textual study based on Carl Gustav Jung's psychoanalytic approach seeks to present a modern and different interpretation of some animals in the Qurʾān and thus eliminate many ambiguities that have existed about naming such animals in the Quran. These animals have a prominent appearance in the Surahs and verses of the Quran: the largest Surah in the Qurʾān is named "Cow"(al-Baqarah)  and the story of "Cow of the Children of Israel" (the Qurʾān, 2: 62) plays a prominent and central role in this Surah: Cow in this story and generally in this Surah symbolizes rebirth, and it seems that the main theme of various scattered stories in this Surah is to revive humans with "faith." The importance of "cow" in this section of the story has made this animal so important in the collective unconscious of the Children of Israel that a little later in the Qurʾānic story, we will witness the "calf worship" of the Children of Israel (the Qurʾān, 2: 93). In one of the most complete stories in the Qurʾān, namely Sūrah Yūsuf, the story also revolves around cows: where the king dreams that seven fat cows being eaten by seven lean (the Qurʾān, 12: 43 & 46). In this symbolic story which is completely related to dream interpretation and psychoanalysis, "cow" is directly related to "fertility" and "drought," and the same symbolic concept of death and life that was discussed in the second Surah is also emphasized here. "Snake" (Ḥayyah) and "serpent" (Thuʿbān) are two other prominent animals that are also considered symbols for the emergence of the mother archetype in Jung's Archetype and are generally reflective of the angry and devouring mother. In the story of Moses and his confrontation with God and also Pharaoh, these two animals play a key role. Snake and serpent in this story are considered symbols for devouring deception, trickery, and evil, and numerous verbal indications in Qurʾānic narrations confirm this modern interpretation of verses.Save to LibraryDownloadby Ghasem Darzi•  4  Philosophy of Science, Hermeneutics, Interdisciplinary Studies, Religious StudiesInstitutions Ignored: A History of Select Committee Scrutiny in the House of Lords, 1968-2021Within the vast seam of scholarship on parliamentary history the evolution and role of select committees in the house of lords, particularly in relation to investigatory or policy-focused committees, has been almost completely overlooked.... moreWithin the vast seam of scholarship on parliamentary history the evolution and role of select committees in the house of lords, particularly in relation to investigatory or policy-focused committees, has been almost completely overlooked. They have been 'institutions ignored'. This gap in the existing research base is particularly stark when compared with the very large literature on the history of select committees in the house of commons. This article fills this gap by providing the first detailed historical account of the evolution of investigatory or policy-focused committees in the house of lords. This account reveals the evolution of a distinctive 'scrutiny style' moulded around the notion of complementarity, a highly specialised approach and an understanding of the merits of self-restraint. However, during 2018-21 a fundamental review of the investigatory committee system was undertaken within the house of lords which led to significant change in relation to both the structure and ambition of committees. The impact of this reform agenda is likely to ensure that select committees in the Lords are far more visible in the future, within and beyond the Palace of Westminster, than they were in the past.Save to LibraryDownloadby Matthew Flinders•  5  Accountability, Parliamentary Studies, Bicameralism, House of Lords reformMiloš Vec, Was verschafft dem Gletscher Achtung?Save to LibraryDownloadby Miloš Vec•  10  Environmental Law, Political Ecology, Environmental Studies, EcologyWenn Berufsethik zu moralischer Belastung führtSave to LibraryDownloadby Pia Madeleine Haug•  2  Philosophy, GynecologyA ética animal em Peter Singer e Tom Regan em virtude da problemática dos direitos universalizáveis dos animaisO artigo aborda a universalização dos direitos dos animais, em relação à teoria da dignidade animal, apresentada por Peter Singer, e a condição moral de existência, analisada por Tom Regan.

Assim, em Singer, constrói-se uma ética dos deveres humanos em relação aos animais, vez que defende a existência digna dos animais que, para o douto autor, se assemelha à existência da dignidade do homem. Mas, Singer não é desleixado com sua teoria, de maneira que fomenta, com base em Kant, uma distinção entre animal como ser senciente e homem como ser consciente. Regan sustenta a condição do sofrimento animal em analogia ao sofrimento humano, criando uma teoria do ‘status moral do sofrimento’, como ponto de partida para sua ética animal, já que o animal, bem como o homem, tem os mesmos níveis de empatia, sofrimentos e dignidade moral.

The challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic point to the importance of establishing this new expansion of the responsible guardianship concept which, having as a theoretical premises not only pathocentric ethics, but also a biocentric ethics of care, would therefore seek to extend the circle of protection offered by the concept of responsible pet care that would advance from companion animals to encompass other sentient beings and finally encompass nature in general. It is an expansion that would be carried out under the holistic perspective of one health, that is, environmental, animal and human.

But there is substantial disagreement about what policy changes would be ethical and effective. For example, should we focus on relatively moderate interventions, such as informational and procurement policy changes, or should we also focus on relatively radical interventions such as meat taxes or bans? In this chapter, we consider the principled and practical pros and cons of meat taxes and bans. We argue that, to the extent that these interventions are (a) necessary to prevent massive and unnecessary harm and (b) can be implemented without violating basic rights, governments should implement them. We close by suggesting that a mixed approach involving taxes, bans, and other interventions will likely be best in  many contexts in the short term.Save to LibraryDownloadby nico stubler•The Relationship Between Psychological Adjustment and Problem-Solving Among Gifted and Talented StudentsSave to LibraryDownloadby Jamal Abuzaitoun•PsychologyLaw of Rights and Protection for Nonhuman Animals in the State of Michoacan de Ocampo.

It focuses on the parties involved in these cases: on their discourses, motivations, and contrasting points of view. Through an examination of judicial files, court decisions and newspaper articles, and interviews with protagonists, the book explores how the question of animal sacrifice is dealt with through administrative, legislative, and judicial practice. It outlines how, although animal sacrifice has over the ages been contested by various religious reform movements, the practice has remained widespread at all levels of society, especially in certain regions. It reveals that far from merely being a religious and ritual question, animal sacrifice has become a focus of broader public debate, and it discusses how the controversies highlight the contrast between 'traditional' and 'reformist' understandings of Hinduism; the conflict between the core legal and moral principles of religious freedom and social progress; and the growing concern with environmental issues and animal rights.Save to LibraryDownloadby Daniela Berti•  12  Religion, Sociology of Religion, Religion and Politics, Animal EthicsPUBLICADO interdisplinar derecho animal bien juridicoSave to LibraryDownloadby Taeli gomez•Afterword: Evidence over InterestsSave to LibraryDownloadby John Gluck•Political ScienceEpizootiological Characteristics of Trichinellosis of Domestic Pigs in the Republic of SrpskaTrichinellosis is parasitic disease aff ecting wildlife, domestic animals and humans, caused by the nematode of the genus Trichinella.

Primary infection route is consumption of infected meat, thus trichinellosis represents a considerable health and economic problem. In the Republic of Srpska, the most common source of human infection is the meat of domestic pigs. Since recently, an increasing number of trichinellosis outbreaks have been attributed to consumption of meat of wild animals, which corresponds with the situation in other countries. During the last decade of the 20th century, numerous outbreaks involving large number of infected people have been reported. In the period 2001-2010, 1256 cases of animal trichinellosis were reported, 1166 of which were identifi ed in domestic swine.

Esta ha sido fruto del trabajo y compromiso de distintos académicos y académicas, cuyas investigaciones esperamos sean de interés para la comunidad jurídica latinoamericana. El presente texto busca servir tanto como marco general para discutir sobre la problemática animal, como también de puerta de entrada hacia un análisis especializado de las distintas dimensiones que supone esta área del derecho.En este sentido, es conveniente recordar que, si bien el derecho animal presenta una serie de problemas comunes, dados por ejemplo por su objeto, fundamento y principios más básicos, en la práctica, también aborda numerosos asuntos que demandan por parte del intérprete, un estudio más detallado y especializado. Así, por ejemplo, los problemas relativos a la constitucionalización de los animales requieren un tipo de abordaje y de técnica normativa que es distinta a la que se necesita para discutir sobre la situación de los animales en espectáculos deportivos, en el ámbito del derecho privado o penal, o en el marco de los temas vinculados con la protección del medio ambiente o en la experimentación científica.Save to LibraryDownloadby Rosa María De la Torre•  2  Animal Law, Animal Rights/LiberationLevemos a sério os direitos dos animaisParece-me importante começar estas reflexões agradecendo aos editores do Jus Animalis pela iniciativa de inaugurar um novo espaço de reflexão e debate jurídico em favor dos outros animais; a nossa disciplina necessita de espaços plurais... moreParece-me importante começar estas reflexões agradecendo aos editores do Jus Animalis pela iniciativa de inaugurar um novo espaço de reflexão e debate jurídico em favor dos outros animais; a nossa disciplina necessita de espaços plurais para trocar argumentos, debater com respeito e difundir as premissas sobre as quais procuramos reconfigurar a relação jurídica entre os humanos e os outros seres.Save to LibraryDownloadby Rosa María De la Torre•  3  Animal Ethics, Animal Law, Animal Rights/LiberationWhat veterinarians can and should know about the price elasticity of demandSave to LibraryDownloadby Stanley Johnson•  9  Veterinary Medicine, Economics, Medicine, AnimalsIs Tax Law Different?

But these benefits are not costless. Also in common with other charities, religious organizations are prohibited from providing private inurement and private benefit, engaging in a significant amount of lobbying, intervening in political campaigns, promoting illegality, or acting contrary to fundamental public policy.The IRS takes the position that these limitations apply with equal force to all tax-exempt charities, including religious organizations. Some \= religious organizations have challenged the application of the lobbying, political campaign intervention, illegality, and fundamental public policy limitations on religious liberty grounds, invoking the Free Exercise of Religion Clause of the First Amendment and, more recently, the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA). To date, however, federal courts have rejected these challenges, concluding that they are permissible conditions on the tax benefits enjoyed by religious organizations.This essay reconsiders this conclusion and the arguments in support of it. One such argument is that tax law is somehow different from other legal contexts for purposes of applying the unconstitutional conditions doctrine to religious organization. The consistent refusal of the courts to allow free-exercise-of-religion-based exemptions from generally applicable federal tax laws suggests this may be the case. This difference could be viewed as a strand of the increasingly disfavored view sometimes referred to as “tax exceptionalism.” But I argue that this difference instead fits within the more traditional compelling governmental interest and least restrictive means analysis codified in RFRA and that arguably applied in the Free Exercise of Religion Clause context before the Supreme Court’s decision in Employment Division v. Smith.More specifically, tax law is different because of its complex rules applicable to all individuals and entities relating to expenditures for lobbying, political campaign intervention, and illegal activity. The complexity of these rules, and the risk that granting exemptions from them for any reason would undermine their uniform and consistent application, support the conclusion that the government has a compelling interest in not allowing exemptions, and that the existing limitations imposed ontax-exempt charities, including religious organizations, are the least restrictive means to do so. As a result, constitutional and RFRA free exercise of religion rights do not require exemptions for religious organizations from these existing limitations even when such organizations are motivated by their religious beliefs to engage in the limited activities. Furthermore, while this argument does not apply to the contrary to fundamental public policy limitation, the Supreme Court has correctly concluded that in the instances where there is a fundamental public policy, ensuring that tax-supported charities do not undermine that policy is also a compelling governmental interest and prohibiting them from doing so is the least restrictive means of furthering that interest.Save to LibraryDownloadby Lloyd H Mayer•  3  Constitutional Law, Religious Pluralism, Nonprofit OrganizationsAnimal Warfare Law and the Need for an Animal Law of Peace: A Comparative ReconstructionThis Article puts forward a novel analogy between animal welfare law and international humanitarian law—two seemingly unrelated bodies of law that are both marked by the aporia of humanizing the inhumane.

Through the comparative lens of the international laws of war and peace, this Article argues that existing animal welfare law is best understood as a kind of warfare law that regulates violent activities within an ongoing “war on animals.” It further submits that this animal warfare law needs to be complemented and counterbalanced by an animal law of peace, consisting of a jus animalis contra bellum and peacetime animal rights.Save to LibraryDownloadby Saskia  Stucki•  8  Comparative Law, Human Rights, International Humanitarian Law, Animal LawEntangled Empathy: An alternative approach to animal ethicsSave to LibraryDownloadby Lori Gruen•  2  Psychology, EmpathyEthics and AnimalsSave to LibraryDownloadby Lori Gruen•Ethics of AnimalsSandai case comment (Supreme Court of Chile)The name 'orangutan' is derived from the Malay words 'orang' (person) and 'hutan' (forest).

This paper focuses on Canada’s federal Health of Animals Regulations, which purport to provide a measure of protection to farmed animals, notably during their transit to slaughterhouses. More specifically, this paper interrogates how the concept of “undue suffering” is interpreted by the Canada Agricultural Review Tribunal (CART) and Federal Court of Appeal (FCA) between 2000 and 2019. During this period, a total of 157 CART decisions applied the “undue suffering” standard with respect to provisions of the federal Health of Animals Regulations, guided in part by three significant FCA decisions. These cases allow us to conduct a longitudinal study of the standard of “undue suffering,” to see how it is interpreted and evolves over time. A core implication is that some degree of suffering was deemed reasonable, though the contours of this permissible suffering remained ambiguous. I argue that twenty years of CART cases demonstrate the shortcomings of regulations which are premised on a standard as vague as “undue suffering.”Save to LibraryDownloadby Andrew Stobo Sniderman•  2  Animal Law, Administrative LawGrävlingars lidande vid grytanlagsprov med levande grävlingSave to LibraryDownloadby Frida Lundmark•  2  Political Science, Fish and Wildlife ManagementLovni fond i njegovo korišćenje u Republici SrpskojSave to LibraryDownloadby Milivoje Urosevic•  2  Geography, HumanitiesHANS JONAS CONTRA O ANIMALISMOResumo: a filosofia biológica de Jonas combate o dualismo cartesiano com seu monismo integral: corpo e espírito constituem duas dimensões de um mesmo organismo animal.

Esta tese não deve ser confundida com o chamado "animalismo" que reduz a pessoa humana ao organismo animal. O objetivo do artigo é mostrar a diferença entre as duas posições.

While animals were once regarded as objects, valuable solely in relation to their use to humans, there is now a substantial movement to recognize animals as inherently valuable and deserving of the same moral status as humans. Thus change in attitude is not reflected in amendments to the Criminal Code anti-cruelty provisions. Vie new provisions recognize that animals have the capacity to feel pain. However, the provisions do not protect animals independently of the benefits that animals provide to humans. Still categorized as property, animals do not share the moral status of humans. Further, under the new provisions, animals do not have legal rights. Therefore, despite changes in the law regarding animals, no animal liberation is taking place.Save to LibraryDownloadby Lyne Létourneau•  4  Political Science, Animal Welfare, Cruelty, Animal RightsProibição do Uso de Animais em Testes Cosméticos no Estado de São Paulo: Impactos e Desafios para o Desenvolvimento da Indústria de Cosméticos e StakeholdersA indústria de cosméticos é um ramo complexo, envolvendo vários atores nas suas relações de pesquisa e desenvolvimento (P&D), regulação, fiscalização, licenciamento e mercado consumidor.

Key arguments for the change of their status are discussed, including the argument from marginal cases, and the scientific evidence indicating that many animals are sentient beings. Two ways of initiating such changes seem most promising: legislation, i.e. the modification of civil codes, and litigation, i.e. filing lawsuits on behalf of individual animals. It is argued that legislative changes are necessary for moving animals out of the legal category of things and into the category of sentient beings that can bear rights. On the other hand, litigation could bring about a more radical change of the legal status of some animals.Save to LibraryDownloadby Zorana Todorovic•  5  Anthropology, Animal Ethics, Animal Law, Animal RightsAnimal Law in South Africa: “Until the lions have their own lawyers, the law will continue to protect the hunter”Save to LibraryDownloadby Amy P.
