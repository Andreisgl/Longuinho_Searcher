Nevertheless, when saline water is used there is an accumulation of non-essential ions (ballast ions, such as Na + and Cl -), since the apparent uptake concentration (the ratio between nutrient and water uptake, C U ) for these ions is much lower than their concentration in the irrigation water. As a consequence, the EC may be no longer correlated to the actual nutrient concentration or, if crop water uptake is compensated with full-strength nutrient solution, there is a progressive salinity build-up and both phenomena may result in a reduction of crop growth and yield.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersEnvironmental Modelling & SoftwareSimulation of crop water and mineral relations in greenhouse soilless culture2011 • Rita Maggini, F.

The aim of the current research was to assess the effect of two nutrient management strategies, based on electrical conductivity (EC) or nitrate-nitrogen (N-NO3−) concentration control on plant growth, ornamental quality, plant–water relations, mineral composition, and WUE of greenhouse Hippeastrum grown in semiclosed soilless system. The recirculating nutrient solution was discharged whenever a threshold EC value of 3.0 dS·m−1 was reached (EC-based strategy), or when N-NO3− concentration decreased below the limit of 1.0 mol·m−3 (nitrate-based strategy). There were no significant differences in terms of plant growth parameters, stomatal resistance, leaf water relations, and macronutrient composition in plant tissues between the two nutrient management strat...Download Free PDFView PDFIII International Symposium on Models for Plant Growth, Environmental Control and Farm Management in Protected Cultivation (HortiModel 2006)SIMPLIFIED MODELS FOR THE WATER RELATIONS OF SOILLESS CULTURES: WHAT THEY DO OR SUGGEST FOR SUSTAINABLE WATER USE IN INTENSIVE HORTICULTURE2006 • Rita Maggini, Luca Incrocci, Giulia CarmassiDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Plant NutritionResponce to NaCl salinity and excess boron in greenhouse tomato grown in semi-closed substrate colture in mediterranean climateLuca Incrocci, Mirco RomaniThe effects of sodium chloride (NaCl) salinity and boron (B) toxicity were investigated in greenhouse tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) plants grown in closed soilless culture under the typical climatic conditions occurring in the Mediterranean regions. The experiment was conducted under semi-commercial conditions. Two NaCl (2.0 and 10.0 mol m−3) and B (27.8 and 185.0 mmol m−3) concentrations were combined to produce four different types of raw water used to prepare the nutrient solutions. The fertigation treatment did not affect significantly the uptake of water and mineral elements apart from that of sodium (Na), chloride (Cl), and B. The use of B-enriched water increased the accumulation of this element in the leaves, which showed marginal chlorosis and necrosis within 35–40 days from planting. No or minor effects of NaCl and B concentrations in the irrigation water were found on leaf area development, biomass accumulation, crop yield and fruit quality.Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of Plant NutritionRESPONSE TO SODIUM CHLORIDE SALINITY AND EXCESS BORON IN GREENHOUSE TOMATO GROWN IN SEMI-CLOSED SUBSTRATE CULTURE IN A MEDITERRANEAN CLIMATELuca Incrocci, Giulia Carmassi, R.
