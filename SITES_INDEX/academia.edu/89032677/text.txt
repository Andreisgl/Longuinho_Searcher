Knowing and not knowing (epistemologizing) emerged as an embodied action, a manifestation of survival, a life-process in time and space. Naturalistic epistemology has emerged in dynamic relation with philosophy, sociology, psychology, biology and genetics. Naturalistic epistemology understands itself as striving to understand the bio-physiological processes that manifest the human activity of thought and emotion – the processes that are involved in the human ability to say “I know”, “I understand”, “I imagine”, “I accomplish”, “I invent”, “I am inspired”. Naturalistic epistemology is rooted in the traditions of realism, the physical sciences, pragmatism. This essay outlines some of the major theoretical approaches to this area of study.Download Free PDFView PDFMind-Brain Relations, Geometric Perspective and NeurophenomenologyWlodzislaw  DuchDownload Free PDFView PDFRobots and the Limits of MoralityRaffaele RodognoIn this chapter, I ask whether we can coherently conceive of robots as moral agents and as moral patients. I answer both questions negatively but conditionally: for as long as robots lack certain features, they can be neither moral agents nor moral patients. These answers, of course, are not new. They have, yet, recently been the object of sustained critical attention (Coeckelbergh 2014; Gunkel 2014). The novelty of this contribution, then, resides in arriving at these precise answers by way of arguments that avoid these recent challenges. This is achieved by considering the psychological and biological bases of moral practices and arguing that the relevant differences in such bases are sufficient, for the time being, to exclude robots from adopting, both, an active and a passive moral role.Download Free PDFView PDFStrong Evaluation without Moral Sources: On Charles Taylor's Philosophical Anthropology and Ethics.2008 • Arto LaitinenCharles Taylor is one of the leading living philosophers. In this book Arto Laitinen studies and develops further Taylor's philosophical views on human agency, personhood, selfhood and identity. He defends Taylor's view that our ethical understandings of values (so called "strong evaluations") play a central role. The book also develops and defends Taylor's form of value realism as a view on the nature of ethical values, or values in general. The book criticizes Taylor's view that God, Nature or Human Reason are possible constitutive sources of value – Laitinen argues that we should drop the whole notion of a constitutive source.Download Free PDFView PDFPraise for THE MORAL LANDSCAPESteven PinkerThe people of Albania have a venerable tradition of vendetta called Kanun: if a man commits a murder, his victim's family can kill any one of his male relatives in reprisal. If a boy has the misfortune of being the son or brother of a murderer, he must spend his days and nights in hiding, forgoing a proper education, adequate health care, and the pleasures of a normal life. Untold numbers of Albanian men and boys live as prisoners of their homes even now.Download Free PDFView PDFL. Magnani (2011), Understanding Violence. The Intertwining of Morality, Religion and Violence: A Philosophical StanceLorenzo MagnaniThis volume sets out to give a philosophical “applied” account of violence, engaged with both empirical and theoretical debates in other disciplines such as cognitive science, sociology, psychiatry, anthropology, political theory, evolutionary biology, and theology. The book’s primary thesis is that violence is inescapably intertwined with morality and typically enacted for “moral” reasons. To show this, the book compellingly demonstrates how morality operates to trigger and justify violence and how people, in their violent behaviors, can engage and disengage with discrete moralities. The author’s fundamental account of language, and in particular its normative aspects, is particularly insightful as regards extending the range of what is to be understood as violence beyond the domain of physical harm. By employing concepts such as “coalition enforcement”, “moral bubbles”, “cognitive niches”, “overmoralization”, “military intelligence” and so on, the book aims to spell out how perpetrators and victims of violence systematically disagree about the very nature of violence. The author’s original claim is that disagreement can be understood naturalistically, described by an account of morality informed by evolutionary perspectives as well. This book might help us come to terms with the fact that we are intrinsically “violent beings”. To acknowledge this condition, and our stupefying capacity to inflict harm, is a responsibility we must face up to: such understanding could ultimately be of help in order to achieve a safer ownership of our destinies, by individuating and reinforcing those cognitive firewalls that would prevent violence from always escalating and overflowing.Download Free PDFView PDFMultiple Individual Moralities May Trigger ViolenceLorenzo MagnaniAn important research in the area of psychology that can enrich our perspective on the relationship between morality and violence concerns the so-called moral disengagement illustrated by Bandura (1999). The neglect of moral conduct is widespread in moral agents: moral standards, even if previously adopted as guidelines for self-sanctioning and to avoid self-condemnation or self-devaluation, are often contravened. The moral behavior, Bandura says, is both inhibitive – refraining from certain behaviour – and proactive – behaving according to that particular idea of humanity, which is embedded in the adopted moral standard. Unfortunately, the activation of the moral standard can be deactivated – that is what moral disengagement is about – so that the alternative behavior is no longer viewed as immoral, the possible consequent harm is minimized, expected positive consequences are overemphasized and victims are devaluated in their very nature as human beings. What is important to note from our perspective is that to “engage moral disengagement” people often construct moral justifications of the new actions so that the conduct is made personally and socially acceptable “by portraying it as serving a socially worthy or moral purpose” (Bandura, 1999, p. 195). The redefinition of killing is an amazing example of disengagement: shifts in destructive people’s behavior is seen in military conduct, where a new conduct “is achieved not by altering their personality structures, aggressive drives or moral standards” (ibid.) Usually this justification also consists in a legitimation of violence!Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
