The Simulacrum of St. Bibiana: Expression and Design in early 17th century Rome ("Eternal Baroque" 2013 London)The light filled high altar in the church of St. Bibiana in Rome holds a sculpture with a surpris... more The light filled high altar in the church of St. Bibiana in Rome holds a sculpture with a surprising gesture and sweet but difficult to define expression.  Before arriving at the white marble statue carved by Gianlorenzo Bernini, the visitor moves through a space marked by the remnants and stories of the saint’s life.  A weathered red porphyry column sits in a corner encased by a metal cage.  This relic of the saint’s flagellation is picked up in a fresco by Pietro da Cortona located just overhead.  Visual similarities between how Bernini and da Cortona represented Bibiana’s expression have lent credence to the ease in interpreting Bernini’s sculpture.  Yet, the marble version of the saint prevents absolute legibility due to the nature of the sculpted object.  Explicit narrative is not contingent upon the three-dimensional format. In the biography by Domenico Bernini, the artist’s voice is conjured to tell how Gianlorenzo did not create the sculpture.  The artist steps aside while the saint miraculously makes her own image.  We should not forget the literary topos from Michelangelo’s life of completed sculptures contained within blocks of marble.  Yet, the idea of the sculpture of St. Bibiana as a miraculously made icon speaks to the sacred performance in her church.  In this paper, I argue that the sculpture of St. Bibiana, the 17th century miraculous simulacrum, has site-specific meaning underscored by its non-narrative expression for the focalizing of the performance of the devotional space.  Here I distinguish performance as more than just experience, in particular, the engaging sensory acts and devotional movements of pilgrims.  A web of meaning at the church has consequence on interpreting the expression of St. Bibiana.  A relic column of her flagellation, a narrative fresco cycle, and a visible ancient coffin filled with the human remains of the saint work in tandem with the sculpture to emphasize the relationship between past and present.  The sculpture is not an archaeological document.  She does not narrate her death.  The sculpture and its setting are a new expressive language of Christian icon and design appropriate for early 17th century Rome.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Sex and Xenophobia in Early Modern Rome: The Reception of the Figure of “Justice” on the Tomb of Pope Paul III at St. Peter’s Basilica ("Desiring Statues" 2012 Exeter)During an official inspection of St. Peter’s Basilica in 1592, Pope Clement VIII deemed a group o... more During an official inspection of St. Peter’s Basilica in 1592, Pope Clement VIII deemed a group of Renaissance sculptures representing nude female figures, allegories of virtues, inappropriate for the soon to be completed new basilica.  The nudity of one female figure, Justice, shown here, was especially offensive because of her nearly complete nakedness, reclining pose, and youthful body. A bronze garment, painted white to match the marble sculpture, was added by the son of the original artist Guglielmo della Porta.  The dressing of the nude statue of Justice at the end of the 16th century was a physical sign of the reform of art in Counter-Reformation papal Rome.In the 17th century, as new St. Peter’s Basilica became a key pilgrim and tourist site for visitors from near and far, an anecdote started to appear in guidebooks about the beautiful but sadly clothed sculpture of the woman on the tomb of Paul III.  The anecdote explained that while the body was still exposed, her sensual figure not only inspired lustful thoughts, but also actions by a Spanish man.  The sculpted form of the nude lovely woman activated sexual actions and an experience with art that was deemed immoral in the context of a sacred space, especially in relation to a monument in honor of the pope who started the Council of Trent, at which was discussed the dangers of nudity in sacred art.I situate the reception of the sculpture of Justice from the tomb of Pope Paul III as an example of xenophobic discourse in 17th century Rome.  A story of a foreigner, in this case Spanish, preying upon a statue on a pope’s tomb plays into popular ideas of the competitions and even bloody clashes between foreigners and locals in Rome.  Anecdote conceals an unsavory truth by attaching a humorous joke at the expense of another and provides a moral lesson about behavior.  The censorship of a nude sculpture due to religious reform was transformed into a xenophobic tale.  It was the fault of a horny foreigner in Rome, not papal reaction, which led to the denial of visual access to the nudity of the sculpture.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Popular Devotion at St. Peter’s Basilica: the Bronze St. Peter, Pope Paul V and Urban VIII ("Sculpture and Touch" 2008 London)In the midst of the simultaneous destruction and construction of St. Peter’s basilica, a bronze s... more In the midst of the simultaneous destruction and construction of St. Peter’s basilica, a bronze sculpture of St. Peter was installed near the new central crossing.  The sculpture has a long history of devotion, but the tactile veneration was officially codified in the early 17th century.  Given that not all people visiting the basilica had access to the pope’s body or the relic of the first pope, St. Peter, the statue served as a substitute body for veneration by means of kissing the feet of the sculpture.  To the present day, visitors to St. Peter’s basilica line up to touch the feet, posing for a moment while a friend or family member takes their photo with the famous statue.      This paper recovers the culturally specific meaning of religious devotion to objects in early modern Rome, in particular, kissing and touching the feet of sculptures of saints and Christ.  I take as my central example the bronze sculpture of St. Peter.  I present new archival evidence related to the dating of the installation of the object, the people who venerated the sculpture, and the tradition of its tactile devotion.  The new information helps place the sculpture within the historically specific context of Pope Paul V’s actions to create sites of popular devotion in the new basilica, which included increasing access to the new basilica’s confessional and installing objects in the new grottoes.  The bronze St. Peter was further popularized during the pontificate of Urban VIII.  The analysis also sheds light on the larger question of how objects became (or were prevented from becoming) appropriate sites of tactile interaction within sacred spaces in early modern Rome.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Artists, collector... more In early modern Rome, many objects without interpretation lay about the city.  Artists, collectors, and antiquarians attempted to create meaning for these objects through a matching game between object and ancient text. When the text did not provide fruits for the investigation, the early archaeologist was left with a silent object requiring the employment of more inventive modes of interpretation.  In the face of the complete erasure of knowledge, meaning was brought to objects through new displays, reintegration, and even imaginative narratives written in guidebooks.      This paper focuses on one of the most elusive objects in the material culture of ancient Rome, namely the so-called Bocca della Verità.  The large weathered stone leaves scholars at a loss to definitively pinpoint its use in antiquity.  And in turn, the interest in its original function makes immaterial the rich later history of the object.  The biography of this object is fraught with ideas of popular reception and superstitious ritual, concepts that are not easily harnessed by modern scholarship.  To this day, the object inspires the imagination of the visitor to Rome through its early 17th century display in the portico of the church of S. Maria in Cosmedin.  This later history of reception and display shows how the most obdurate objects from antiquity inspired early modern beholders and interpreters.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
