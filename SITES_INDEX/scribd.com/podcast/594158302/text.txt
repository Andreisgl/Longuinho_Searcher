Estas embarazada!!!” After a devastating couple of months it feels like I’m emerging out of the depths of the misery of my first trimester. I literally almost gave up at the end of it. I didn’t want anything. I didn’t have an interest in anyone. Some mornings I was waking up, dragging myself to the yoga mat, only to lay there and cry. For days and hours, I just laid on the couch mindlessly staring into the empty corner of the living room, the floor or some useless Netflix movie or series. Nothing was exciting. I started questioning life and why I’m here. I was so apathetic; I was missing parties, yoga classes, salsa and other stuff. I didn’t have the physical or emotional energy. It was mostly hormones, I assume, but something more profound than that struck me. I was frustrated that I have to go through this and not String. Why? Why do I have to go through nausea, tiredness, anemia, and anxiety and he doesn't? I started fearing for my future body... Stretch marks, crazy extended over-sucked breasts. Flappy belly and the extra weight. Having the baby chained to my breasts. Not having a normal life again. I want to go diving for f*ck sake!!! Why can’t I go dancing, getting high, trying crazy things like I usually do?!!? Why!! My life is gone forever. That was me for like two months.  No wait, that was not me. That was a confused, scared, hormone infused, overwhelmed and crazy me. I know now because the normal me is back. I am quite excited about the baby now!!! It took a couple of stages to get here. I had a session with a psychotherapist (highly recommended!) and many talks with girlfriends and family. I have a supportive husband who was running around ice-cream or whatever else I wanted. Who dropped everything and came home to take care of me when I was throwing up. I went from anger, frustration, disappointment, fear, and confusion to acceptance, surrendering and letting go. I just gave in. I looked at my tattoo daily: “It is what it is. We are where we’re at. This too shall pass.” It did pass. And here I am. In full awe and appreciation. And gratitude. I’m excited. In love with life and in fact, I find advantages! I have a team now!!! Like it’s me and her who are tackling life! I feel the creative life and force. Like I’m not alone. We can do all this together. Take on business, life or anything together! Weird stuff, I know! Curious if any new moms experienced this.

Do you ever get in creative funks where you lack the drive to create while feeling invisible to the world?
 
There are those sinister inner voices that try to convince you that your work doesn’t matter and that you can’t make a difference.
 
I’m pretty sure everyone goes through these phases whether they admit it or not.
 
This episode is me admitting this to you in hopes you don’t feel alone in the times you feel invisible as a creative or life in general.
 
There is light at the end of the tunnel as I’m learning that this is _part of the struggle_ of pursuing something that’s important to you. In due time, it will be important to others as well.
 
It’s okay to feel this way at times, _it’s natural_. However, you are capable of pulling yourself out of this creative funk and pushing forward to the next phase on your creative path.
