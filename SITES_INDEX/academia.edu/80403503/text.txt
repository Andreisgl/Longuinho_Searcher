As is shown below, regarding Assyria, comparing the visibility of the queen to that of the king is very misleading; it is also not a fruitful methodological approach. The king was the main and almost the only protagonist of both pictorial and verbal narratives in any period of Neo-Assyrian history. Consequently, a comparison of frequency of appearance for any official, including the queen as such, with that of the king should not be applied to written or pictorial sources, because the king will always be represented far more often. I would like to highlight the profound fallacy of approaching the visibility of the queen in relation to the visibility of the king, in conjunction not only with pictorial sources but...See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersChanges in Neo-Assyrian QueenshipSaana SvärdIn: Natalie N.

There is no conclusive proof for such a practice. It is argued that the title of “queen” was connected to that of the king and that, when a new king ascended to the throne, his wife replaced the former holder of the title as queen. Moreover, the analysis of textual sources and archaeological data establishes that in at least three cases, there is no discernable correlation between the queen and the mother of the crown prince.Download Free PDFView PDFCHANGE IN NEO-ASSYRIAN IMPERIAL ADMINISTRATION: Evolution and RevolutionNatalie Naomi MayDownload Free PDFView PDFChange in Neo-Assyrian Imperial Administration: Evolution and Revolution.

During the Neo-Assyrian period (approximately 934-612 BCE, based in modern Iraq) the annals and royal inscriptions of several kings mention women with a curious title: ‘Queen of the Arabs’. These women have been included in previous discussions regarding Assyrian interaction with the ‘Arabs’, but a full investigation into their roles as rulers has been lacking. This is what this dissertation seeks to answer: what were the roles of the ‘Queens of the Arabs’ during the Neo-Assyrian period? The reason for no prior traditional Assyriological research into these women is due to a very small number of texts. As Assyriology has traditionally been a textbased discipline, a corpus of just twenty-eight texts has not been seen as ‘worthy’ of a full investigation. This dissertation goes beyond the traditional approach, by incorporating gender theory and comparative methodology. A key heuristic tool in this dissertation is Michael Mann’s ‘IEMP’ model of power. This has identified three key areas where we can clealy see the roles of the ‘Queens of the Arabs’: military, economic, and religious roles. The most important finding was that the process of researching about ‘Arabs’ meant contending with two layers of misinterpretation. The first of which is the misunderstandings of modern scholars allowing modern stereotypes influence how they write about ‘Arabs’. The second is that the ancient sources themselves do not seem to know who or what they refer to when they discuss the ‘Arabs’. This has resulted in a discussion based on these women as individuals, not as a group. We do not know if they all ruled the same population group, and so they may have all been rulers of different cultures. We see Samsi, Teʾelḫunu, and Adiye in positions of military leadership, and Samsi was potentially even present on thebattlefield. Zabibê, Samsi, and Tabūʾa all exhibited the ability to control either resources or access to the networks that transported these resources. And finally, Teʾelḫunu likely had a religious role of some sort as part of her leadership duties, but we do not know what that was. None of these women appear in all of the chapters, and as such should be discussed as individualsDownload Free PDFView PDF“Family Matters: Psychohistorical Reflections on Sennacherib and His Times,” in: I.

S. Svärd and A. Garcia-Ventura“In Pursuit of Neo-Assyrian Queens: An Interdisciplinary Model for Researching Ancient Women and Engendering Ancient History”2018 • Amy Rebecca GansellIncorporating the results of recent, primarily philological, research into an interdisciplinary methodology, this study aims to reintegrate queens into Neo-Assyrian history. Archaeologically, the Nimrud tombs provide evidence for the appearance, treatment, and personal identities of deceased women. Art historical analysis of large- and small-scale images of queens considers not only the nature of the queenly image, but the significance of the contexts in which these artworks would have been viewed. In addition, the royal use of divine and fantastical, often nude, female figures provides a window onto elite concepts of ideal feminine beauty, which royal women would have emulated and embodied. Enhancing the standard triad of textual, archaeological, and art historical evidence, ethnographic comparison can provide models to enliven and reinforce ancient sources, and digital reconstructions can be used to visually hypothesize and more actively analyze ancient realities. Finally, because neither male nor female histories exist independently, the relationship between king and queen is interpreted in the context of the palace, court, empire, and cosmos.Download Free PDFView PDFTHE VIZIER AND THE BROTHER: SARGON II'S BROTHER AND VIZIER SĪN-AḪU-UṢUR AND THE NEO-ASSYRIAN COLLATERAL BRANCHES 1Natalie Naomi MayIt is now firmly established that Sargon II's brother Sīn-aḫu-uṣur was also his vizier (sukkallu). He was the addressee of many letters written by the subjects of the Empire. He appears on a number of contemporary documents. The present study demonstrates that the correspondence of Sargon's brother and vizier, together with some historical documents, show that Sīn-aḫu-uṣur was ruling Babylonia on behalf of his brother, the king. The paper will analyse the spheres of the king's brother's involvement in the state affairs. The article investigates the extraordinary status and functions of the sukkallu of Sargon, who restored the grandeur of this office based on the Middle Assyrian precedent especially for his brother. The author further explores Ḫarrān as the seat of the collateral royal family members and the role of the precedent of the Middle Assyrian dynasty of sukkallus, the kings of ḪaniGALbat, 2) in the ideology of the Sargonids. Lastly, I will argue that the relationship between Sargon and Sīn-aḫu-uṣur served a model for Esarhaddon in his division of power between his two sons and heirs, Assurba-nipal and Šamaš-šumu-ukīn.Download Free PDFView PDF"Royal Women Sages in Aramaic Literature: The Unnamed Queen in Daniel 5 and Saritrah in the ‘Revolt of Babylon’.” Pp. 151-74 in From Mari to Jerusalem and Back: Assyriological and Biblical Studies in Honor of Jack Murad Sasson, ed. A. Azzoni et al. University Park: Eisenbrauns, 2020.2020 • Tawny HolmThis essay examines two major female characters of Aramaic literature, the Babylonian queen in Daniel 5, and Saritrah, the Assyrian princess in the "Revolt of Babylon" on Papyrus Amherst 63 (cols. xviii-xxiii), the Aramaic papyrus written using Demotic Egyptian script. While the model for the unnamed Babylonian queen may be either the mother of King Nabonidus, Adad-guppi (d. 547 BCE), or perhaps a composite of multiple figures, Saritrah is primarily based on the historical Šērūʔa-ēṭirat, sister of the royal brothers Assurbanipal and Shamash-shum-ukin who were rivals in the seventh century BCE. While Daniel 5's "Writing on the Wall" story is well known, the "Revolt of Babylon" is not, and this paper presents a new interpretation of it with new readings of the Saritrah sections of the text. Both Daniel 5 and the "Revolt of Babylon" represent an Aramaic stage in the transmission of lively traditions concerning first-millennium Mesopotamian royal women, some of whom had long afterlives in Greek and other languages.Download Free PDFView PDFState Archives of Assyria BulletinSaana SvärdNatalie N.
