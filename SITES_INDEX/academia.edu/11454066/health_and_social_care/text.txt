The aim of this study was to elucidate the contribution of the elements and context of work undertaken by support workers in health and social care.Methods Thematic review of the literature 2005/2006, updated in 2008.Results A total of 134 papers were included in the review, from which we identified four domains of work and four core roles of support workers. The four domains of support worker work are direct care, indirect care, administration and facilitation. The four ‘core’ attributes of support worker roles were being a helper/enabler, a companion, a facilitator and a monitor. The more ‘technical’ components of support worker roles are then shaped by contextual factors such as staffing levels and the delegation processes.Conclusion Despite the heterogeneity of support worker roles, there are some uniting ‘generic’ features, which may form some or all of the role of these practitioners. Contextual factors influence the specific technical aspects of the support role, accounting in part for their heterogeneous role.Download Free PDFView PDFTransforming social care: sustaining person centred supportJennie FlemingDownload Free PDFView PDFDefining and identifying common elements of and contextual influences on the roles of support workers in health and social care: a thematic analysis of the literature2011 • Susan NancarrowResults A total of 134 papers were included in the review, from which we identified four domains of work and four core roles of support workers.

Others are volunteers and community health and social workers based at facilities or community sites. Many caregivers are family members or part of a client&#39;s close social network. Additionally, people living with HIV/AIDS (PHA) themselves engage in self-care and provide support to other PHA through support groups. In the best-case scenario the services of these caregivers are sometimes provided free of charge at one site by a specialized NGO. In many cases, however, a person wishing to gain access to care and social services may need an understanding how the systems and procedures of various institutions operate. Many PHA are unprepared for the administrative, financial, and legal barriers that they may encounter. To cope with this need, a new type of support service called the &quo...Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
