The exact pathophysiology leading to dementia is still uncertain, but the apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 genotype plays a major role. We aimed to identify the molecular pathways associated with amyloid β aggregation using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomics and to study the potential modifying effects of APOE ε4 genotype. Methods We tested 243 proteins and protein fragments in CSF comparing 193 subjects with AD across the cognitive spectrum (65% APOE ε4 carriers, average age 75 ± 7 years) against 60 controls with normal CSF amyloid β, normal cognition, and no APOE ε4 allele (average age 75 ± 6 years). Results One hundred twenty-nine proteins (53%) were associated with aggregated amyloid β. APOE ε4 carriers with AD showed altered concentrations of proteins involved in the complement pathway and glycolysis when cognition was normal and lower concentrations...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Open peer commentary Inflammation and Alzheimer's diseaseInflammation clearly occurs in pathologically vulnerable regions of the Alzheimer’s disease (AD) ... more Inflammation clearly occurs in pathologically vulnerable regions of the Alzheimer’s disease (AD) brain, and it does so with the full complexity of local peripheral inflammatory responses. In the periphery, degenerating tissue and the deposition of highly insoluble abnormal materials are classical stimulants of inflammation. Likewise, in the AD brain damaged neurons and neurites and highly insoluble amyloid b peptide deposits and neurofibrillary tangles provide obvious stimuli for inflammation. Because these stimuli are discrete, microlocalized, and present from early preclinical to terminal stages of AD, local upregulation of complement, cytokines, acute phase reactants, and other inflammatory mediators is also discrete, microlocalized, and chronic. Cumulated over many years, direct and bystander damage from AD inflammatory mechanisms is likely to significantly exacerbate the very pathogenic processes that gave rise to it.

Dopamine Signaling Modulates Microglial NLRP3 Inflammasome Activation: Implications for Parkinson’s DiseaseBackground: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by the loss of nigral dopaminergic neurons ... more Background: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by the loss of nigral dopaminergic neurons leading to impaired striatal dopamine signaling, α-synuclein- (α-syn-) rich inclusions, and neuroinflammation. Degenerating neurons are surrounded by activated microglia with increased secretion of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), driven largely by the NLRP3 inflammasome. A critical role for microglial NLRP3 inflammasome activation in the progression of both dopaminergic neurodegeneration and α-syn pathology has been demonstrated in parkinsonism mouse models. Fibrillar α-syn activates this inflammasome in mouse and human macrophages, and we have shown previously that the same holds true for primary human microglia. Dopamine blocks microglial NLRP3 inflammasome activation in the MPTP model, but its effects in this framework, highly relevant to PD, remain unexplored in primary human microglia and in other in vivo parkinsonism models.

α‐Synuclein evokes NLRP3 inflammasome‐mediated IL ‐1β secretion from primary human microgliaGlia,  2021Synucleinopathies such as Parkinson&#39;s disease (PD) are hallmarked by α‐synuclein (α‐syn) path... more Synucleinopathies such as Parkinson&#39;s disease (PD) are hallmarked by α‐synuclein (α‐syn) pathology and neuroinflammation. This neuroinflammation involves activated microglia with increased secretion of interleukin‐1β (IL‐1β). The main driver of IL‐1β secretion from microglia is the NLRP3 inflammasome. A critical link between microglial NLRP3 inflammasome activation and the progression of both α‐syn pathology and dopaminergic neurodegeneration has been identified in various PD models in vivo. α‐Syn is known to activate the microglial NLRP3 inflammasome in murine models, but its relationship to this inflammasome in human microglia has not been established. In this study, IL‐1β secretion from primary mouse microglia induced by α‐syn fibrils was dependent on NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and caspase‐1 activity, as previously reported. We show that exposure of primary human microglia to α‐syn fibrils also resulted in significant IL‐1β secretion that was dependent on inflammasome assembly and involved the recruitment of caspase‐1 protein to inflammasome scaffolds as visualized with superresolution microscopy. While canonical IL‐1β secretion was clearly dependent on caspase‐1 enzymatic activity, this activity was less clearly involved for α‐syn‐induced IL‐1β secretion from human microglia. This work presents similarities between primary human and mouse microglia in the mechanisms of activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by α‐syn, but also highlights evidence to suggest that there may be a difference in the requirement for caspase‐1 activity in IL‐1β output. The data represent a novel characterization of PD‐related NLRP3 inflammasome activation in primary human microglia and further implicate this mechanism in the pathology underlying PD.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

We selected 26 probable Alzheimer&#39;s disease (AD) patients with MBs, 26 age- and sex-matched AD patients without MBs, 11 vascular dementia (VaD) patients, and 22 patients with subjective complaints. We measured amyloid beta 1-42 (Aβ42) and 1-40 (Aβ40) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) function using albumin ratios. CSF Aβ42 was lowest in AD with MBs, whereas Aβ40 was selectively decreased in VaD. In plasma, amyloid-beta was nonsignificantly elevated in VaD compared with controls. Higher albumin ratios in VaD suggested blood-brain barrier dysfunction. A MB pattern suggestive of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) related to lower CSF Aβ42, while a non-cerebral amyloid angiopathy specific MB distribution related to higher plasma Aβ40.

Maximal COX-2 and ppRb expression in neurons occurs during early Braak stages prior to the maximal activation of astrocytes and microglia in Alzheimer's diseaseJournal of neuroinflammation,  Jan 21, 2005Neuronal expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and cell cycle proteins is suggested to contribut... more Neuronal expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and cell cycle proteins is suggested to contribute to neurodegeneration during Alzheimer&#39;s disease (AD). The stimulus that induces COX-2 and cell cycle protein expression in AD is still elusive. Activated glia cells are shown to secrete substances that can induce expression of COX-2 and cell cycle proteins in vitro. Using post mortem brain tissue we have investigated whether activation of microglia and astrocytes in AD brain can be correlated with the expression of COX-2 and phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein (ppRb). The highest levels of neuronal COX-2 and ppRb immunoreactivity are observed in the first stages of AD pathology (Braak 0-II, Braak A). No significant difference in COX-2 or ppRb neuronal immunoreactivity is observed between Braak stage 0 and later Braak stages for neurofibrillary changes or amyloid plaques.

In the present study, human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells or murine primary cortical neurones treated with NSAIDs were protected against the otherwise toxic effects of amyloid-beta1-42. COX-1 selective inhibitors provided greater protection than did COX-2 selective inhibitors or lipoxygenase inhibitors, suggesting that activation of COX-1 is required for amyloid-beta1-42-induced neurotoxicity. Although the production of neuronal prostaglandin E2 in response to amyloid-beta1-42 was reduced by the presence of COX-1 inhibitors, no neurotoxic effects of prostaglandin E2, or any other prostaglandin, were observed.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Involvement of serum amyloid P component and C-reactive protein in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's diseaseNeurobiology of Aging,  2000ABSTRACT In Alzheimer&amp;#39;s disease (AD) amyloid plaques are associated with inflammatory med... more ABSTRACT In Alzheimer&amp;#39;s disease (AD) amyloid plaques are associated with inflammatory mediators such as complement activation products, as well as activated microglial cells. Like in other forms of amyloid, the Aß plaques in AD brain are decorated with serum amyloid P (SAP). In this study, SAP immunostaining was found to be confined to Aß deposits and colocalized with that for C1q in senile plaques of AD patients. In temporal cortex specimens of non-demented controls, that predominantly contain diffuse type amyloid plaques, a low number of plaques weakly stained for C1q as well as for SAP. SAP, especially when clustered, can activate complement via the classical pathway in vitro. Taken together, these findings suggest that a certain degree of fibrillarity of Aß is needed to get sufficient density of SAP deposition for C1 binding and activation to occur. Although a role for C-reactive protein (CRP) in complement activation in AD has been suggested, no immunostaining for CRP was observed in amyloid plaques. Neither was CRP mRNA detected by RT-PCR in brain specimens of 6 AD and 6 non-demented control cases. This suggests that, in contrast to acute conditions, such as myocard infarction, where CRP and complement activation products co-localize in the infarcted area, CRP is not available in AD brain parenchyma and does not play a role in complement activation in AD amyloid plaques.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Reliable immunohistochemical (IHC) methods to detect Aβ and Aβ-associated factors (AAF) in brain specimens are needed to determine their role in AD pathophysiology. Formic acid (FA) pre-treatment, which is generally used to enable efficient detection of Aβ with IHC, induces structural modifications within the Aβ, as well as in AAF. Consequently, interpretation of double IHC stainings becomes difficult. Therefore, serial stainings of two newly produced monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) VU-17 and IC16 and two other mAbs (6E10 and 3D6) were performed with four different pre-treatments (no pre-treatment, Tris/EDTA, citrate and FA) and additionally six IHC characteristics were scored: diffuse/compact/classic plaques, arteries with cerebral Aβ angiopathy, dyshoric angiopathy, capillaries with dyshoric angiopathy. Subsequently, these stainings were compared with IHC procedures, which are frequently used in a diagnostic setting, employing mAbs 4G8 and 6F/3D with FA pre-treatment. IHC Aβ patterns obtained with VU-17 and, IC16 and 3D6 without the use of FA pre-treatment were comparable to those obtained with 4G8 and 6F/3D upon FA pre-treatment. Omission of FA pre-treatment gives the advantage to allow double IHC stainings, detecting both Aβ and AAF that otherwise would have been structural modificated upon FA pre-treatment.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
