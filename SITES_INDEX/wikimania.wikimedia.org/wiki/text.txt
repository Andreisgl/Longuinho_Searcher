PortalHomeProgramOrganizersRegistrationTravelDesignsOtherHelp
Wikimania 2023 ran from 16–19 August in Singapore at the Suntec Singapore Convention and Exhibition Centre and online.  Workshops, hackathon and pre-conference activities happened 15 August while post-conference and city tours happened on 20 August.
The theme for the 18th Wikimania edition is Diversity. Collaboration. Future.
Diversity. Wikimania will be an opportunity to showcase regional and thematic groups such as ESEAP as examples of inclusion: different volunteer groups, individuals, and affiliates, at different stages of development and from different cultures closely involved and collaborating in an equitable way.
Collaboration. As a distributed, global event, Wikimania will be a way to learn from each other and share knowledge like community initiatives, tools usage, organizing events, governance, online campaigns and edit-a-thons, solving Wiki-related problems, and more.
Future. Wikimania 2023 will be significant to many Wikimedians as a forum to discuss implementing the 2030 Wikimedia Movement Strategy (#Wikimedia2030), and other current and future priorities facing our movement, from technology to policy around the world.
 Wikimania is the annual conference celebrating all the free knowledge projects hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation –  Wikimedia Commons,  MediaWiki,  Meta-Wiki,  Wikibooks,  Wikidata,  Wikinews,  Wikipedia,  Wikiquote,  Wikisource,  Wikispecies,  Wikiversity,  Wikivoyage,  Wiktionary – with days of conferences, discussions, meetups, training, and workshops. Hundreds of volunteers and Free Knowledge leaders from around the world gather to discuss issues, report on new projects and approaches, and exchange ideas.
This 18th edition was a collaboration among volunteers, chapters and user groups of the Wikimedia East, Southeast Asia and the Pacific (ESEAP).
