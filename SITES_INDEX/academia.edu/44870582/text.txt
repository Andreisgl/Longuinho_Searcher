In the Arcades, Benjamin analyzes gambling in relation to capitalism, religion, and psychoanalysis, and to our experience of time. Like prostitution, with which it is paired in Convolute O, gambling is a kind of ritual or game with a long history that has taken on a new guise in the exchange economy of capitalism. Benjamin believes that a genealogy of the practice can uncover aspects of its former, transformative meaning, expressed in bodily innervation. I claim that gambling is related to Benjamin’s idiosyncratic idea of prophecy, in which looking toward the past opens up new possibilities of meaningful experience. It signals a possible rupture in capitalistic society, one that has revolutionary political potential, precisely because the practice is so ubiquitous.Download Free PDFView PDFHuman freedom and finance - Delivered at at the conference Internet of Things e Blockchain: analisi interdisciplinare, University of Calabria, 2018Human freedom and finance. A critical picture of the economy of gamblingDomenico  CorteseThe concept of freedom has always been object of disputes between the theorists who privilege the “negative” aspects of it – for example, Bentham and Nozick – and who privilege the “positive” liberty typical of Hegel’s dialectic. A real autonomy of intention and a control on the realization of this latter – prerequisites of authentic negative freedom - is always compromised within a chaotic and asymmetric economic context. We need to take into account things such as the balance between an individual’s predicted “disutility” in her production or in her carrying out a career choice and this individual’s utility obtained by exchanging her product. The factors of luck and contingency prevail, and they also include the initial distribution of instruments among individuals. This seems to prove Hegel’s claim on the emptiness of the concept of negative freedom. The determinant of freedom, according to the dialectical perspective, is the feeling of «being a vehicle of Geist». I translate this, in economic terms, as the ability to realize an identity which reflects the highest feeling of union and reciprocity within a social environment. In other words, freedom is the ability to achieve the desired social satisfaction. This coincides with an aggregate maximization of reciprocity, that is to say an optimization of the value of the products – both in a commercial and in a relational sense – we offer in order to obtain the highest values in exchange. Power discrepancies between subjects, though, can weaken the existential bond at the basis of a maximization of ones “production”: the expectations of a suitable reciprocation. The contagion of bad expectations is well described, in non-philosophical terms, by authors such as Keynes, Minsky, Kalecki, Schumpeter, Stiglitz. Here the necessity of problematizing economic financialization takes place. At a social level, in fact, freedom is optimized with a maximization and equalization of reciprocal bargaining power which minimizes discrepancies. Freedom has as its condition the awareness of the necessity of such a holistic calculation. The character of individualistic gamble in the allocation of funds of today’s financial structure suppresses a similar awareness. Equity and bond secondary markets, private credit systems and their relationships with customers, big corporation management, shares buyback practices all share this structure and this will be analyzed. The allocation of capital is determined by individual isolated expectations which are based on an estimate of what others’ expectations are, while these latter are based on what others’ expectations are and so on. The impression of the others influences the outcome of an investment, its cost, the odds of its success and how the fruits of the success are shared: this logic is describable as an individual bet, and it may resemble the essential features of lotteries. Such a distribution of wealth is made according to a solipsistic notion of merit – everybody who succeeds does this thanks to her ability to realize privately and probably short-term successful calculation - and not a holistic notion of it. According to this latter notion, meritocratic recognition can raise the incentives to give long-term contribution to society within a person. The self-referential connection among individual impressions ensures that creation and accumulation of power and wealth follow routes which are completely random in comparison with a careful assessment of the long term holistic result of the intersection of individual wills. A coordination game in Nash equilibrium maximizing aggregate outcome is a good sample of such an assessment. Freedom is ultimately in function of the will to engage in a similar assessment but it would not be completely coincident with the Hegelian conception since, in this latter, highest relationality can be achieved as a synthesis of conventional cultural tendencies – it may justify the power discrepancy of a financial bubble until it is no longer perceived as harmonic by all social classes.Download Free PDFView PDFCasino capitalism and the financial crisisRebecca CassidyI argue that by describing the current financial crisis as the result of ‘casino capitalism’ commentators are reinforcing familiar and baseless assumptions about exchange and deflecting serious criticism from the true causes of the problem and how we might respond to them. I refer to recent ethnography by anthropologists working in international finance and to three features of casinos: customers, markets and regulation, in order to support the argument that neither individual casinos, nor the industry in general are good exemplars of ‘casino capitalism’.Download Free PDFView PDFGambling, Alchemy, and the Addiction to Risk in William Godwin's St. Leon (ASECS 2013, Conference Paper)Jared McGeoughDownload Free PDFView PDFFooled by Randomness: The Hidden Role of Chance in Life and in the Markets2010 • Sally  GainsburyThe notion of gambling, traditionally applied to specified and organised games of chance, is increasingly being used to refer to a wider spectrum of behaviours and activities. In Fooled by Randomness, Taleb argues that chance plays a dominant role in many aspects of daily life, including financial markets, and that to succeed in life the role of chance must be understood in order to maximise gains and minimise losses.Download Free PDFView PDF1 Option luck , gambling , and fairness Forthcoming in Ethical Perspectives2012 • Daniel ButtThis article takes its inspiration from an essay by G.A. Cohen, “Fairness and legitimacy in justice, and: does option luck ever preserve justice?”, which was written for a Festschrift for Hillel Steiner (de Wijze, Kramer, and Carter, 2009), before appearing in the posthumously published collection On the Currency of Egalitarian Justice, and Other Essays in Political Philosophy (Cohen, 2011). It was, as Michael Otsuka notes in his Introduction to the latter volume, Cohen’s last published word on the subject of luck egalitarianism. The essay showcases Cohen’s characteristic analytical brilliance, but it is acknowlegedly inconclusive as to aspects of its central question, which concerns whether outcomes sanctioned by luck egalitarians as a result of individuals’ decisions to expose themselves to option luck should be seen as just. My aim in this essay is to challenge, revise, and expand a central part of Cohen’s argument, which concerns the question of whether the outcomes of gambles w...Download Free PDFView PDFPoker- The Parody of CapitalismOle BjergPoker is an extraordinary worldwide phenomenon with major social, cultural, and political implications, and Poker: The Parody of Capitalism investigates the game of poker as a cultural expression of significance not unlike art, literature, film, or music. Tracing the history of poker and comparing the evolution of the game to the development of capitalism, Ole Bjerg complicates prevalent notions of “casino capitalism” and correspondingly facile and simplistic comparisons of late capitalism and poker. By employing Slavoj Žižek's threefold distinction between imaginary-symbolic-real as a philosophical framework to analyze poker and to understand the basic strategies of the game, Bjerg explores the structural characteristics of poker in relation to other games, making a clear distinction between poker and other gambling games of pure chance such as roulette and craps. With its combination of social theory and empirical research, Poker offers an engaging exploration of a cultural trend.Download Free PDFView PDFCritical Gambling StudiesBook Review: Cassidy, Rebecca.
