Zero ozone depletion potential (ODP) and low global warming potential are the major challenges looked at by many researchers. This paper, summarizes the challenges of experimenting R1234yf refrigerant for automobile HVAC system. Major factors considered are cost, efficiency, experiments, two-phase flow mechanisms, thermophysical properties, regulatory gauges, operation and maintenance. Survey results of the refrigerant reveal that, there is no evidence of breakdown. Apart from a significant reduction in global warming potential (GWP), R1234yf requires high work for the compressor with shorter cycle run-time of compressor.Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of Thermal EngineeringEnergetic and exergetic performance comparison of an experimental automotive air conditioning system using refrigerants R1234yf and R134a2021 • Ahmet KolipIn this study, the energetic and exergetic performance merits of an automotive air conditioning (AAC) system using R134a and R1234yf have been investigated. For this aim, a laboratory AAC system was developed and equipped with devices for mechanical measurements. The refrigeration circuit of the system mainly had an evaporator, condenser, liquid receiver, fixed capacity compressor, and thermostatic expansion valve. The tests were performed by changing the compressor speed and air stream temperatures incoming the condenser and evaporator. Based on energy and exergy analysis, various performance parameters of the AAC system for both refrigerants were determined and presented in comparative graphics. It was found that R1234yf resulted in 0.4–10.9% lower refrigeration capacity, 5.5–11.6% lower COP, and 4.7–16.1°C lower compressor discharge temperature, while yielding 9.3–22.3% higher refrigerant mass flow rate and 1.1–3.5°C higher conditioned airstream temperature in comparison to R134a...Download Free PDFView PDFInternational Journal of Automotive Science And TechnologyPerformance Analysis of Different Refrigerants in Automobile Air Conditioning Equipment Using Variable Capacity Compressor2021 • ALPASLAN ALKANDownload Free PDFView PDFA Review on Comparative Study of Performance of R1234yf Refrigerant and R134a RefrigerantIOSR JournalsDesign of heat exchanger for refrigeration system, involves improving the performance. The high performance of refrigeration system can be achieved by some of the factors such as enhanced heat exchanger, using appropriate cross section of the heat exchanger and using the high-performance refrigerants. This review paper :-1) provides an overview on two phase flow condensation of a R1234yf and R134a refrigerants, 2) address the condensation in heat exchanger which is, influenced by various factors, 3) provides information about the correlations of Heat Transfer Coefficient (HTC) which is influenced by various factors. Finally from the literature it is concluded that, HTC increases with increasing in vapor quality. And also pressure drop increases with increasing in vapor quality due to molecular collision in two phase flows and also their is an opportunity to study the influence of various parameters such as mass flow rate, saturation temperature and surface roughness on flow condensation of R1234yf refrigerant to come up with new correlation which gives minimum error compared to experimental work. Conclusion: From literature it is concluded that, HTC increases with increasing in vapor quality. And also pressure drop increases with increasing in vapor quality due to molecular collision in two phase flows.Annulus roughness of the tube in tube heat exchanger affect the heat transfer rate of the R134a refrigerant and annulus roughness is found to increase HTC of R134a refrigerant. COP of R1234yf is 25% less than that of R134a [11] & [13]. Since 25% of total power consumption is used for refrigeration and air conditioning field alone. If COP of a new refrigerant R1234yf is increased by using an appropriate design then there will be reduction in power consumption rate. Further, how the HTC is affected by mass flow rate, saturation temperature, and surface roughness during condensation of R134a and R1234yf is not investigated exhaustively.In literature, many authors predicted correlation for the heat transfer during, condensation of refrigerants. But these predictions are not satisfactory and the having deviation from the actual experimental work. There is an opportunity to study the influence of above discussed parameters on flow condensation of new refrigerant to come up with new correlation which gives minimum error.Download Free PDFView PDFEnergyThe refrigerant R1234yf in air conditioning systems2011 • Claudio ZilioDownload Free PDFView PDFApplied SciencesCoupling Effect of Air Flow Rate and Operating Conditions on the Performance of Electric Vehicle R744 Air Conditioning System2011 • Yulong Song, Assoc. Prof. Paride Gullo, PhDThe air flow rate on the gas cooler side is one of the key parameters affecting the performance and running safety of transcritical CO2 electric vehicle air conditioning systems. After experimentally analyzing the effects of the air volume flow rate in the gas cooler on the cycle parameters and system performance, a novel method to evaluate the optimal air flow rate was proposed. In addition, the effect of the gas cooler air volume flow rate on the key performance parameters of the system (e.g., optimal discharge pressure) was explored. Finally, the coupling effects of the compressor speed, ambient temperature and optimal air flow rate on the system performance was also exhaustively assessed. It was found that as the discharge temperature, the CO2 temperature at the gas cooler outlet and the discharge pressure did not vary more than ±2%, the corresponding gas cooler air volume flow rate was optimal. For the single-row and dual-process microchannel evaporator used in this work, the recommended value of the optimal gas cooler air volume flow rate was 2500 m3·h−1. The results could provide reference for the fan speed design of electric vehicle CO2 air conditioning systems, especially for the performance under idling model.Download Free PDFView PDFPERFORMANCE ANALYSIS OF AIR COOLED WATER  COOLER BY USING ECO - FRIENDLY REFRIGERANT S AS A POSSIBLE SUBS TITUTE OF R134AIJESRT JOURNALThe EU F - gas regulation would take effect from January 1,2015. The regulation implies an HFC phase - down from 2015 to 2030 by means of bans on high GWP refrigerants. Especially R134a is under pressure and likely to be phased out of all commercial systems. Since the regulation has just been adopted andthere is still a great deal of uncertainty as to what will happen. we follow the situation closely and just like other experts we expect the use of low GWP refrigerants to grow with intermediate solutions eme rging like for instance R152a as substitution for R134a; although these solutions are intermediate they are likely to be used for some years into the future. We also expect new blends of R152a and R134a to play a role yet to be seen. In the present work, t he performance of the Air cooled water cooler test rig based on vapour compression refrigeration cycle is studied by using R134a and on the basis of their experimental result , we studying the result of R152a and blending of R152a with R134a in various ma ss fraction with help of Refprop property software. The result are analyzed in terms of Coefficient of performance(cop) , Refrigeration capacity, compressor work , condenser capacity, specific volume, Thermal conductivity and miscibility of lubricants show s that R152a, R134a/R152a - 30/70 and R134a/R152a - 10/90 is possible alternate for R134a.Download Free PDFView PDFProgress in Industrial Ecology, An International JournalAutomotive air-conditioning system technology: a review2020 • 19CIVIL304 PRITHIVI RAJAN NDownload Free PDFView PDFIAEME PUBLICATIONAn Investigation of Automobile Air-conditioning System Using Alternate Refrigerant - A Review2013 • IAEME PublicationThe objective of this paper is to present review on the alternative refrigerants used in the Automobile air conditioning system. There are various refrigerants like R134a, R12, R290, R600a etc are used for automobile air conditioning system. This review paper presents the studies of various refrigerants such as HFC, HC and mixture of both HC & HFC. The performance-based standards for low GWP refrigerants in Europe and the United States allow automakers to choose a replacement for HFC134a. However, other concerns including cost, feasibility, and safety can limit these options. HFC152a, HFO-1234yf and carbon dioxide are alternatives that may substantially reduce climate impacts and meet safety standards. This study also presents the studies of nano refrigerants to reduce the effect of global warning as well as to optimize the performance of automobile air conditioning system. With the help of these studies, we observe that the HC, HFC and their mixture with nano particles can have better performance than R134a and R12, R22 refrigerants in automobile air condition system.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
