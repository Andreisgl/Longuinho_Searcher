Semantic problems can have different origins, such as a mismatch of specific predictions based on the context, low plausibility, or even semantic impossibility of a word in the given context. DeLong, Quante & Kutas (2014) provided the first direct evidence for topographically different late positivities for prediction mismatch (left frontal late positivity for plausible but unexpected words) and plausibility violation (posterior-parietal late positivity for implausible, incongruent words). The aim of the current study is twofold: (1) to replicate this dissociation of ERP effects for plausibility violations and prediction mismatch in a different language, and (2) to test an additional contrast within implausible words, comparing impossible and pos...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Novel L2 words do not facilitate but interfere with their L1 translations during picture naming – behavioural and event-related potential evidenceLanguage, Cognition and Neuroscience,  2016ABSTRACT Early and late bilinguals name pictures in their native language faster when accompanied... more ABSTRACT Early and late bilinguals name pictures in their native language faster when accompanied by the name’s translation equivalent from their second language. Here, we tested whether this effect also obtains with recently learned L2 words. Participants learned novel names for 36 familiar objects via a statistical association procedure. These novel words and their L1 translations were subsequently used as auditory (identical, semantic, unrelated) distractors in a picture–word interference task. Participants named the pictures with their L1 name (Experiments 1 and 2) or with their novel name (Experiment 2). Against our prediction, the L2 translations led to interference instead of facilitation in L1 naming. The reverse situation (L2 naming, L1 distractor) showed no interference. In event-related potentials, identical distractors induced a reduced N400 in all conditions except in the one that showed behavioural interference. The results are discussed in relation to models of bilingual language production.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Cognitive emotion regulation in children: Reappraisal of emotional faces modulates neural source activity in a frontoparietal networkDevelopmental cognitive neuroscience,  Jan 28, 2015Emotion regulation has an important role in child development and psychopathology. Reappraisal as... more Emotion regulation has an important role in child development and psychopathology. Reappraisal as cognitive regulation technique can be used effectively by children. Moreover, an ERP component known to reflect emotional processing called late positive potential (LPP) can be modulated by children using reappraisal and this modulation is also related to children&#39;s emotional adjustment. The present study seeks to elucidate the neural generators of such LPP effects. To this end, children aged 8-14 years reappraised emotional faces, while neural activity in an LPP time window was estimated using magnetoencephalography-based source localization. Additionally, neural activity was correlated with two indexes of emotional adjustment and age. Reappraisal reduced activity in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during down-regulation and enhanced activity in the right parietal cortex during up-regulation. Activity in the visual cortex decreased with increasing age, more adaptive emotion...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

We showed that spoken word forms of an (artificial) foreign language are integrated rapidly and successfully into existing lexical and conceptual memory networks. The new lexemes were learned in an untutored way, by pairing them frequently with one particular object (and thus meaning), and infrequently with 10 other objects (learned set). Other novel word forms were encountered just as often, but paired with many different objects (nonlearned set). Their impact on semantic memory was assessed with cross-modal priming, with novel word forms as primes and object pictures as targets. The MEG counterpart of the N400 (N400m) served as an indicator of a semantic (mis)match between words and pictures. Prior to learning, all novel words induced a pronounced N400m mismatch effect to the pictures. This component was strongly reduced after trainin...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

A large N400 but no BOLD effect--comparing source activations of semantic priming in simultaneous EEG-fMRIPloS one,  2013Numerous studies have reported neurophysiological effects of semantic priming in electroencephalo... more Numerous studies have reported neurophysiological effects of semantic priming in electroencephalography (EEG) and in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Because of differing methodological constraints, the comparability of the observed effects remains unclear. To directly compare EEG and fMRI effects and neural sources of semantic priming, we conducted a semantic word-picture priming experiment while measuring EEG and fMRI simultaneously. The visually presented primes were pseudowords, words unrelated to the target, semantically related words and the identical names of the target. Distributed source analysis of the event-related potentials (ERPs) successfully revealed a large effect of semantic prime-target relatedness (the N400 effect), which was driven by activations in a left-temporal source region. However, no significantly differing activations between priming conditions were found in the fMRI data. Our results support the notion that, for joint interpretations of exi...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Disentangling semantic and response learning effects in color-word contingency learningIt is easier to indicate the ink color of a color-neutral noun when it is presented in the color ... more It is easier to indicate the ink color of a color-neutral noun when it is presented in the color in which it had been shown frequently before, relative to print colors in which it had been shown less often. This phenomenon is known as color-word-contingency learning. It remains unclear whether participants actually learn semantic (word-color) associations or/and response (word-button) associations. We here present a novel variant of the paradigm that can disentangle semantic and response learning, because word-color and word-button associations are manipulated independently. In four experiments, each involving four daily sessions, novel words (pseudowords such as enas, fatu or imot) were probabilistically associated either with a particular color, a particular response-button position, or with both. Neutral trials were also included, and participants’ awareness of the contingencies was manipulated. The data showed no impact of explicit contingency awareness, but clear evidence both ...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In a mismatch negativity (MMN) study, the English pseudoword /θond/ was presented along with the deviants /tond/ and /sond/, while ERP-data were collected from Dutch listeners. If experience influences the MMN, smaller amplitude deviances should be observed for /tond/, the deviant typical for Dutch learners of English, than for the less typical deviant /sond/. If, on the other hand, the MMN mainly reflects perceptual similarity, smaller amplitude deviances should be found for the perceptually similar /sond/ deviant. The results of Dutch listeners revealed a significant deviance interaction, with /sond/ eliciting a smaller MMN and longer latencies than /tond/. This suggests that perceptual similarity rather than linguistic experience influences prelexical processing of th-subst...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Young and older speakers participated in a picture-word interference (PWI) task with compound targets. To increase the processing load, the two pictures of the compounds’ constituents were presented side-by-side for spoken naming (e.g., a picture of a sun + a picture of a flower to be named with sunflower). Written distractors either corresponded to the first or second constituent ( sun or flower → sunflower), or were semantically related either to the first constituent of the target ( moon → sunflower) or to the second constituent/whole word ( tulip → sunflower). Morpho-phonological facilitation was obtained for both constituents, whereas semantic interference was restricted to first-constituent-related semantic distractors. Furthermore, a trend towards facilitation was obtained for distractors that were semantically related to the whole word.

Constituent distractors of compound targets (lip or stick for the target LIPSTICK) speeded compound naming, while naming was slowed by distractors that were categorically related to the compound as a whole (powder → LIPSTICK). Furthermore, no effects were obtained for distractors from the same category as the first constituent of compound targets in picture-naming latencies (toe → LIPSTICK). These effects were present in both age groups and indicate that compounds are stored holistically at the lemma level, and as morphemes at the word-form level, unaffected by age. Main effects of age revealed overall slower picture naming and less accurate responses in the elderly. Furthermore, older speakers showed stronger morphological facilitation, while semantic distractor effects were unaffected by age. In a non-verbal attentional control task (Simon task), older speakers were slower overall and showed larger processing costs than young speakers in the conflict (incongruent) condition. Our data replicate a decline in non-verbal attentional control with age and also reveal slower and more error-prone picture-naming in the elderly. These language-specific changes, however, seem to be independent from attentional control and are likely to result from less fluent morpho-phonological encoding in the elderly.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
