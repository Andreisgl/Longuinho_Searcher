Currently, the consumption of wild edible mushroom is increasing as a result of their good source of protein and micronutrients. Apart from their healthy food source, mushrooms serve as therapeutic foods and are also useful in the management of such diseases as hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders and cardiovascular disorders. Mushrooms are also good sources of antioxidants and are therefore possible protective agents for the reduction of oxidative damage in humans without any side effects. In recent times edible mushrooms have attracted interest as functional foods as well as source of bioactive metabolites for the development of drugs and nutraceuticals. Some have also been found to be a source of phenolic Various methods are available for the screening of pharmacologically active substances in extracts.

Primarily, phenolic and flavonoid type metabolites have gained major importance due to the strong capacity of scavenging free radicals. The study was mainly focused to investigate the natural antioxidant properties of macrofungi found in Sri Lankan dry zone forest reserves using DPPH radical scavenging assay and to find out the contribution of phenol and flavonoid substances towards their antioxidant capacity. EC50 values of all extracts were below 1.2 mg/ml. Among the analyzed specimens, Phellinus repandus and Inonotus porrectus showed the most potent antioxidant activities having EC50 of 7.91 ± 1.38 μg/ ml and 19.70 ± 0.17 μg/ ml, respectively. Ten fungal forms exhibited EC50 < 300 μg/ ml and eighteen showed a mean values of EC50 in the range of 300-1200 μg/ ml. Further, P. repandus and I. porrectus also exhibited the highest level of total phenols and flavonoids. EC50 values of the species studied were inversely related to the total phenol and flavonoid contents.The analyzed macrofungi specimens exhibited high antioxidant power highlighting their potential as therapeutically useful antioxidant agents. Particularly, P. repandus and I. porrectus could be an important source of novel antioxidant compounds. In addition, phenol and flavonoid compounds largely contribute to the scavenging activity of studied macrofungi.
