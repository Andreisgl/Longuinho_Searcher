It was a typical Catholic middle-class family of Wexford farmers. In 1844, as a member of an emigrant group organized by Kilrane merchant James Pettit, John Murphy went to Liverpool, sailed to the Río de la Plata region and settled in Buenos Aires. He first worked digging ditches in the district of Chascomús, and then as a shepherd in Chacabuco. In 1854 Murphy purchased land in Salto and established the successful sheep-farm "La Flor del Uncalito", in which many other Irish immigrants (including his brothers William and Patrick) would work as shepherds and ranch hands. When his mother died in 1861, John Murphy went to Ireland to visit the family and returned to Argentina in 1863.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
The Irish Road to South America: Nineteenth-Century Travel Patterns from Ireland to the Río de la Plata regionIrish Migration Studies in Latin America,  2006The nineteenth-century Irish emigration to Argentina has been studied from different perspectives... more The nineteenth-century Irish emigration to Argentina has been studied from different perspectives. There is a growing number of historical, demographic and cultural studies focusing on diverse aspects of this migration, which together with Quebec and Mexican Texas, produced the only Irish settlements in non English-speaking territories. However, with a few exceptions, most of these studies concentrate on the settlement and the life of the emigrants from the time they arrived to their destination, thus neglecting the preparations for their journey and the material details of the voyage. While this essay deals primarily with the Río de la Plata region, including the pampas of Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay, many of its conclusions may be projected to other parts of the continent. How did the Irish emigrants travel from their townlands and rural villages to the most important ports in Ireland and England, and from there to South American ports? What means of transport did they use on land and sea, and how had those vehicles changed with the technical advances of the century? How expensive were the fares and how comfortable was the accommodation?

For nearly a century, these works of art and decorations offered by governments and institutions encouraged smooth diplomacy and fluent international negotiations in the fields of labour, trade and human rights. On occasions hidden, removed and forgotten, and then recovered and restored, the history of the artworks in the Centre William Rappard represents the confrontation between art as diplomatic device and aesthetic experience, between representation and represented, between censorship and free expression. Even before its opening in 1926, the building started receiving works from the International Labour Organization member governments. Some pieces, such as the "Geneva Window" by Harry Clarke, never arrived in Geneva since it was censored by the Irish government. The Spanish "Pygmalion" by Eduardo Chicharro y Agüera was latter covered for its female nudity and remained hidden during decades. Later in the 1970s the secretariat of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade occupied the building and requested the removal of other major works. This was reversed in the 2010s by its successor the World Trade Organization, when many artworks were rediscovered, restored and placed in their original locations. However, new values in the world scene contributed to further changes in the building art, including the removal of Claude Namy’s caricature "In GATT We Trust" from public view in 2019. Art in the Centre William Rappard continues to speak to the viewer after waves of the positive reception, censorship and recovery.  Contents: 1.

The Irish in Latin America-a continent emerging from indigenous cultures, colonisation, and migrations-may be regarded as colonised in Ireland and as colonisers in their new home. They are a counterexample to the standard pattern of identities in the major English-speaking destinations of the Irish Diaspora. Using literary sources, the press, correspondence, music, sports, and other cultural representations, in this thesis I search the attitudes and shared values signifying identities among the immigrants and their families. Their fragmentary and wide-ranging cultures provide a rich context to study the protean process of adaptation to, or rejection of, the new countries. Evolving from oppressed to oppressors, the Irish in Latin America swiftly became ingleses. Subsequently, in order to join the local middle classes they became vaqueros, llaneros, huasos, and gauchos so they could show signs of their effective integration to the native culture, as seen by the Latin American elites. Eventually, some Irish groups separated from the English mainstream culture and shaped their own community negotiating among Irishness, Englishness, and local identities in Brazil, Uruguay, Peru, Cuba, and other places in the region. These identities were not only unmoored in the emigrants' minds but also manoeuvred by the political needs of community and religious leaders. After reviewing the major steps and patterns of Irish migration to Latin America, the thesis analyses texts from selected works, offers a version of how the settlers became Latin Americans or not, and elucidates the processes by which a new Irish-Latin Ameri-can hybrid was created.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This edition abridges some of the documents that make up the bulk of the volume: two memories and two sets of family letters from Irish immigrants in Argentina, without losing any substance. The documents are presented in this volume in their original language. Murray has also added a fuller discussion of the notion, conveyed in the title of the book, that social identities represent processes rather than fixed identities" (review by José Moya).Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The Irish in Latin America-a continent emerging from indigenous cultures, colonisation, and migrations-may be regarded as colonised in Ireland and as colonisers in their new home. They are a counterexample to the standard pattern of identities in the major English-speaking destinations of the Irish Diaspora. Using literary sources, the press, correspondence, music, sports, and other cultural representations, in this thesis I search the attitudes and shared values signifying identities among the immigrants and their families. Their fragmentary and wide-ranging cultures provide a rich context to study the protean process of adaptation to, or rejection of, the new countries. Evolving from oppressed to oppressors, the Irish in Latin America swiftly became ingleses. Subsequently, in order to join the local middle classes they became vaqueros, llaneros, huasos, and gauchos so they could show signs of their effective integration to the native culture, as seen by the Latin American elites. Eventually, some Irish groups separated from the English mainstream culture and shaped their own community negotiating among Irishness, Englishness, and local identities in Brazil, Uruguay, Peru, Cuba, and other places in the region. These identities were not only unmoored in the emigrants' minds but also manoeuvred by the political needs of community and religious leaders. After reviewing the major steps and patterns of Irish migration to Latin America, the thesis analyses texts from selected works, offers a version of how the settlers became Latin Americans or not, and elucidates the processes by which a new Irish-Latin Ameri-can hybrid was created.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

On the one hand, there is a grammatical ambiguity in the original title inFrench, which can be rendered in English as either "Hate for the West" or "Hate of the West". The West - namely, the US and Europe - is both theobject and subject of hatred by and for the poorer countries.

After Rosas's fall in 1852, as Hanon rightly points out in her introduction, "many other British landed in Buenos Aires to work in the railways, meatpacking plants, utility companies and large ranches. British settlements were established in Patagonia, Irish-owned palatial homes were built on Avenida Alvear, and football, tennis, polo, rugby began to be played ... but that is another story" (page 15).
