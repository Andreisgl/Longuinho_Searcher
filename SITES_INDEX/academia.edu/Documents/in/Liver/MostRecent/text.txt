Here, we show that ring-stage parasite-infected red blood cells exposed to KAE609 become spherical and rigid, probably through osmotic dysregulation consequent to the disruption of the parasite&#39;s Na(+) efflux pump (ATP4). We further show that this peculiar drug effect is likely to cause accelerated splenic clearance of the rheologically-impaired Plasmodium vivax and P. falciparum infected red blood cells.Save to LibraryDownloadby Laurent Rénia•  12  Biology, Malaria, Infectious Diseases, MedicineMinimal Role for the Circumsporozoite Protein in the Induction of Sterile Immunity by Vaccination with Live Rodent Malaria SporozoitesImmunization with live Plasmodium sporozoites under chloroquine prophylaxis (Spz plus CQ) induces sterile immunity against sporozoite challenge in rodents and, more importantly, in humans.

Full protection is obtained with substantially fewer parasites than with the classic immunization with radiation-attenuated sporozoites. The sterile protection observed comprised a massive reduction in the hepatic parasite load and an additional effect at the blood stage level. Differences in the immune responses induced by the two protocols occur but are as yet little characterized. We have previously demonstrated that in mice immunized with irradiated sporozoites, immune responses against the circumsporozoite protein (CSP), the major component of the sporozoite&#39;s surface and the leading malaria vaccine candidate, were not essential for sterile protection. Here, we have employed transgenic P lasmodium berghei parasites in which the endogenous CSP was replaced by that of P lasmodium yoelii , a...Save to LibraryDownloadby Laurent Rénia•  20  Biology, Malaria, Medicine, Biological SciencesContent AlertsThis article cites 57 articles, 27 of which can be accessed freeSave to LibraryDownloadby Mary Ann•[Changes in the fat composition and histomorphology of the liver in TPN, with and without ultra-short bowel]Short Bowel syndrome is a serious intestinal insufficiency.

The most common etiology in adults nowadays is intestinal ischemia and inflammatory disease, while in children the most common are congenital anomalies, volvolus and necrotizing enterocolaitis, which makes the TPN obligatory. However the intestine is intimately related to the liver through the entero-hepatic circulation and different endocrinological entero-hepatic systems. Massive intestinal resections and TPN would alter this relationship, and could change the hepatic tissue composition and its histomorphology. The aim of this work is to know these changes in more detail. We used 3 experimental groups: Group A (10 guinea pigs), which was given anesthetic and a simple laparotomy and fed for 10 days with NPT. Group B (10 guinea pigs), underwent total thin intestine resection and were fed for 10 days with NTP. The control group (6 guinea pigs) underwent anesthetic and a simple sham laparotomy and were fed orally.

Morin hydrate possesses antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer properties. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the effects of morin hydrate (50 and 100 mg/kg, orally) against the renohepatic toxicity induced by a high dose of cisplatin (20 mg/kg, intraperitoneally). Renal and hepatic function, oxidative/nitrosative stress, and inflammatory markers along with histopathology were evaluated. Morin hydrate ameliorated cisplatin-induced renohepatic toxicity significantly at 100 mg/kg as evidenced from the significant reversal of cisplatin-induced body weight loss, mortality, functional and structural alterations of kidney, and liver. The protective role offered by morin hydrate against cisplatin-induced renohepatic toxicity is by virtue of its free radical scavenging property, thereby abating the depletion of cellular antioxidant defense components...Save to LibraryDownloadby RANADEEP GOGOI•  20  Pharmacology, Chemistry, Inflammation, Oxidative StressEvaluation of Liver Damage After Application of TVE in the Rat ModelSave to LibraryDownloadby Fatih Avşar•  16  Oxidative Stress, Medicine, Liver, IschemiaThe effects of dimethyl sulfoxide on liver damage caused by ischemia-reperfusionSave to LibraryDownloadby Fatih Avşar•  16  Surgery, Treatment, Medicine, LiverHeterogeneity of damage between segments of rat liver after inflow-outflow obstructionTotal vascular exclusion (TVE) causes warm liver ischemia.

Methods To determine the sites and pathways of nitric oxide formation, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and the nitric oxide trap diethyldithiocarbamate-Fe were used to detect directly nitric oxide formed in intestine, liver and lungs of rats subjected to local intestinal ischaemia–reperfusion (I/R), in the presence or absence of nitric oxide donors or inhibitors. In addition, the role of nitric oxide in control of the gastrointestinal circulation was determined by means of a coloured microsphere technique employing N-(G)-Monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) in rats subjected to haemorrhagic shock followed by resuscitation. Results In contrast to remote organs lung and liver (no change), intestinal I/R resulted in an increase in nitric oxide formation in intestinal tissues....Save to LibraryDownloadby Babak Sobhian•  5  Medicine, Nitric oxide, Nitric Oxide Synthase, Ischaemia/reperfusionSíndrome de Cushing por secreción ectópica de ACTH: análisis del mecanismo fisiopatológico de la hipokalemia: comunicación de dos casosSave to LibraryDownloadby ISABEL MONSERRAT PEREZ CARDENAS•CTNI-62.

We report updated data on an expanded dataset. METHODS Patients with TRK fusion primary CNS tumors in two clinical trials (NCT02637687, NCT02576431) were included. Responses were investigator-assessed. RESULTS As of July 2021, 38 patients with TRK fusion primary CNS tumors (median age, 10.8 [range 1.3–79.0] years) were identified: high-grade glioma (HGG; n = 23), low-grade glioma (LGG; n = 9), and other (n = 6). Sixteen (42%) patients had ≥ 2 prior systemic therapies. ORR for 37 evaluable patients was 30% (95% confidence interval [CI] 16–47): three complete responses, eight partial responses, 21 stable disease (16 patients ≥ 24 weeks), and five progressive disease.

One of the problems that can be encountered after treating CE patients is the risk of post-surgical relapses or treatment failure, thus a long-term clinical and serological follow-up is required to evaluate the success or failure of therapy. In the present study immunological markers have been identified to indicate the effectiveness of pharmacological and surgical treatments. The relationship between serum cytokine levels and the outcome of chemotherapy and surgery was evaluated in 50 patients with CE. Serum interleukin (IL)-4, IL-10 and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) concentrations were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) before and after pharmacological and surgical treatment. Serum cytokine levels of IL-4, IL-10 and IFN-γ were elevated in a significant proportion of patients during the active stage of disease.

Many therapeutic remedies of natural or synthetic properties were used. AIM: This study aimed to investigate and compare the effects of ginger/rosuvastatin (ROSU) on the liver of rats with induced NAFLD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty adult male albino rats were used in this study and divided into four equal subgroups, Group I, control received the standard rat chow diet and given normal saline (1 ml/kg/day), Group II, high-fat diet (HFD) group, Group III, received HFD+ ROSU (15 mg/kg/day), and Group IV, HFD+ Zingiber officinale (10% W/V) for 6 weeks. At the end of our experiment, the rats were sacrificed then blood samples were collected for biochemical analysis of lipid profiles and liver enzymes, liver specimen was prepared for light and electron microscopic examination, and measurement of tissue level of malondialdehyde. RESULTS: NAFLD caused degenerative changes and lipid deposition in liver cells as evidenced by microscopic results and laboratory tests. Treatment with ginger/ROSU alleviated those changes. CONCLUSION: Ginger and ROSU could ameliorate liver functions in NAFLD and ginger effect is superior to ROSU.Save to LibraryDownloadby Tamer M . M .

The pattern of expression of these class Ib MHC genes is not well characterized, although some of their products such as the serologically detectable Qa-2 and TL Ag are expressed mainly in lymphoid and hematopoietic tissues. In this study, the expression pattern of BALB/c class I genes has been analyzed in adult bone marrow and fetal liver. cDNA libraries were synthesized from these tissues, and isolated class I cDNA clones were characterized by hybridization with oligonucleotide probes and by nucleotide sequence analysis. Of the 29 total class Ib genes, transcripts of five including Q6d, Q7d, T9c, T10c, and the 37 gene were isolated from the bone marrow cDNA library. Four of these can encode proteins; the sequence of the T10c gene demonstrates it is most likely a pseudogene.

Good manufacturing practices (GMP) and sophisticated product analysis (PhytomicsQC) to ensure consistency are now available allowing the assessment of its utility. Polychemical Medicines, like TCM, include chemicals with distinct tissue-dependent pharmacodynamic properties that result in tissue-specific bioactivity. Determining the mode of action of these mixtures was previously unsatisfactory; however, information rich RNA microarray technologies now allow for thorough mechanistic studies of the effects complex mixtures. PHY906 is a long used four herb TCM formula employed as an adjuvant to relieve the side effects associated with chemotherapy. Animal studies documented a decrease in global toxicity and an increase in therapeutic effectiveness of chemotherapy when combined with PHY906.

The limitations of various cellular therapies, including bone marrow (BM)-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), urges the exploration of stem cell sources more suitable for transplantation. Human umbilical cord blood (HUCB) can overcome these drawbacks with a favorable reparative outcome. The aim of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic potential of MSCs in 2 groups of chronic liver injury experimental models. Propagation and characterization of MSCs isolated from cord blood (CB) samples were performed and differentiation into osteogenic, adipogenic and hepatogenic lineages was induced. The 1st experimental model group (80 mice) included a negative control, a pathological control and 60 mice infected with Schistosoma mansoni (S. mansoni) and transplanted with MSCs. The 2nd experimental model group (30 hamsters) included 10 healthy hamsters serving as a negative control and 20 hamster...Save to LibraryDownloadby Manal Kamel•  8  Pathology, Stem Cell, Medicine, TransplantationUsing FitnessGram to Measure the Impact of 'Lost' Physical Education During the COVID YearsPhysical education can play a critical role in helping children establish a foundation for an active lifestyle.

There is reason to believe the impact of COVID-19 eliminating compulsory physical education in the K-12 setting only exasperated the problem of increasingly physically unhealthy children in the United States. Much of what kinesiology and public-health scholars know about the fitness level of American youths are based on dated or retrospective data; FitnessGram has emerged as a viable option for revealing the present-day physical health of youth populations. There is clear potential for FitnessGram data to contribute to advancing knowledge about current levels of health-related fitness in youth. In this study, researchers using FitnessGram data from an independent K-12 school district in Texas, USA (ISD) investigated K-12 students' fitness levels and patterns after the COVID-19 pandemic. Results indicate students suffered diminished cardiovascular fitness levels during COVID years (2020-2021), but not diminished strength and endurance or range of motion. Findings from FitnessGram data advocate for quality and compulsory physical education and movement/physical activity in school settings, as well as the adoption of Comprehensive School Physical Activity Promotion (CSPAP).Save to LibraryDownloadby Colin G .
