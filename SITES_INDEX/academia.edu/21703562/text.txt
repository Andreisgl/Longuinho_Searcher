The figural mosaic inscribed in Greek letters identifies the figure as Tryphe. The female bust mosaic is one of the two mosaic images yet has been found on floor mosaics in Paphlagonia, along the Black Sea Coast. Allegorical representations and personifications frequent imagery of floor mosaics of the Antique Period. Personifications represented as female bust images are numerous in the East Mediterranean floor mosaic repertoire.

Paul Getty Museum, by Alexis BelisGetty Villa, J. Paul Getty MuseumWith an introduction by Christine Kondoleon, and contributions by Nicole Budrovich, Kenneth Lapatin, and Sean Leatherbury In Roman decor, elaborate mosaics transformed entire rooms into spectacular settings of vibrant color, figural imagery, and abstract design. Intricate patterns and narrative scenes were created by setting tesserae—small pieces of stone or glass—into floors and walls. The mosaics in the collection of the J. Paul Getty Museum span the second through the sixth centuries AD and reveal the diversity of compositions found throughout the empire during this period. Recovered from various archaeological contexts, these mosaics provide a glimpse into the richly embellished architecture of the ancient world. This optimized online catalogue enables the reader to explore these ancient objects using zoomable high-resolution photography, embedded glossary terms, comparative images linked to sites on the web, and interactive maps drawn from the Digital Atlas of the Roman Empire. The complete catalogue, as well as object data and main images, can be downloaded for free in multiple formats.

ULUSLARARASI ANTIK MOZAIK SEMPOZYUMUBirte PoulsenDuring excavations and restoration of the Myndos Gate in 1998-2000, there was revealed an extensive late antique necropolis with at least 22 monumental tombs, some decorated with mosaics. The tombs now stand in close proximity to the swimming pool of a modern hotel, but originally they faced onto the streets of the necropolis. although the size of the monuments varies, they display a common type. several of the larger tombs were two stories in height and above one or two barrel vaulted burial chambers, they had another, single room likewise spanned by a barrel vault. Three or four of the tombs were preceded by a porch or pronaos forming the entrance to the tomb, and three of these display mosaic pavements. The tombs probably contained multiple burials, and preserved inscriptions seem to indicate that these were family memorials. The imagery of the mosaic floors includes a hunting scene, a crater with emerging vine scrolls and birds pecking at bunches of grapes in addition to adjacent thyrsoi, and various geometric designs. The style and iconography of these floors are related to the mosaics of a late antique domus in halikarnassos, the so-called house of Charidemos, dated by various means to the mid-5th century a.D. The decorated tombs, along with other local structures and mosaics of the same period, indicate that halikarnassos (Bodrum) was a wealthy town in late antiquity.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
