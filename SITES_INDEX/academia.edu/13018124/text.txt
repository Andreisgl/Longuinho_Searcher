This five week long course (known as the EDCMOOC) was delivered twice in 2013, and is considered an atypical MOOC in its utilisation of both the Coursera platform and a range of social media and open access materials. The combination of distributed and aggregated structure will be highlighted, examining the arrangement of course material on the Coursera platform and student responses in social media. This paper will suggest that a dominant instrumentalist view of technology limits considerations of these systems to merely enabling or inhibiting educational aims. The subsequent discussion will suggest that sociomaterial theory offers a valuable framework for considering how educational spaces are produced through relational practices between humans and non-humans. An analysis of You Tube and a bespoke blog aggregator will show how the algorithmic properties of these systems perform functions that cannot be reduced to the intentionality of either the teachers using these systems, or the authors who create the software, thus constituting a complex sociomaterial educational enactment.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersHTTP://EDUCATION.

The approach departs from dominant social constructivist and cognitivist approaches to pedagogy and focuses on how learning is an effect emerging from multiple heterogeneous human and non-human agents acting in social software settings. The analysis mapped the contributions made by material entities, actions and online practices and using a sensitivity adopted from Actor Network Theory (ANT) studies of innovation and science practices. The study, gave participant status to technical things, that acted in relation to what emerged as learning in this social software setting. 1. Learning online as an effect of technologies and people together online In what follows I outline ways my research addressed materiality in learning especially in a higher education online setting. Message posts were produced with digital technologies, and online profiles of students were associated with the message content and various digital media inclusions became active contributors to social media messaging. To describe this in terms of how learning emerged in this online setting this study took a sociomaterial approach where both the people and the social media technologies are considered active contributors to learning online. The interpretive work in the study is informed by an Actor Network Theory (ANT) sensibility (Latour,Download Free PDFView PDFDistance EducationDigital culture clash: “massive” education in theE-learning and Digital CulturesMOOC2014 • Jeremy KnoxDownload Free PDFView PDFBeing social or social learning? A sociocultural analysis of the FutureLearn MOOC platformPhillip Benachour, Philip TubmanMOOC environments seem to offer the potential for massive amounts of social learning. The numbers of registered learners can be very impressive, but it is unclear whether they realize this potential. MOOC environments have unique challenges for pedagogy which are not seen in other socio-constructivist learning environments. These are the scale of participation and diversity of participation. Learners have access to a wide range of points of view, but few means to filter this, creating information and collaboration overload issues. This study quantitatively examines interaction data from 10 MOOC instances of 6 distinct courses, hosted on the FutureLearn platform. The interaction data is taken as an indicator for depth of learning or knowledge construction in the sociocultural sense. Although levels of participation are high within these MOOCs, most conversations are seen to have surface level interactions. New platform and pedagogy affordances are suggested that may help deal with the 'overload' issues which result in these interaction problems. These affordances aim to give more agency to learners, enabling them to be more active in seeking relevant content and interacting with it.Download Free PDFView PDFHacking the Classroom: Rethinking Learning through Social Media PracticesNishant ShahSocial media's ubiquity is transforming contemporary education. Students inhabit classrooms with connected devices, streaming data, chatting on personal messaging, and sharing information with invisible audiences. The academic curriculum is challenged not only by social media resources, but also by novel, complex practices of producing, organising, evaluating and distributing knowledge. Some have taken the emergence of these connected learning environments as questioning the very need of a physical classroom. We seek to unpack the dynamics that social media generate in academic teaching, thinking, and learning without severely compromising the pedagogic impulse and intentions of learning. Consequently, this paper begins with a look at the rapid rise and even faster decline of Massively Open Online Courses (MOOCs) with the aim of identifying some of the pitfalls for attempts to rethink higher education in the light of social media. The second part of this paper proposes that the classroom was historically constructed with and in relationship to technologies of knowledge production, thus questioning the dissociation between the pedagogical practices and technological conditions of learning. This leads into an exploration of some of the modes of engagement in user generated content platforms, which have potentially fruitful resonances in higher educationDownload Free PDFView PDFEducación XX1Seeking Connectivist Freedom and Instructivist Safety in a Mooc2015 • Nathaniel OstashewskiDownload Free PDFView PDFWalker, S., & Creanor, L.

It describes the pedagogies adopted within these courses, and goes on to explore some key themes emerging from the research and relating to the pedagogical use of weblogs and wikis in particular. These themes relate primarily to the academy's tendency to constrain and contain the possibly more radical effects of these new spaces. Despite this, the findings present a range of student and tutor perspectives which show that these technologies have significant potential as new collaborative, volatile and challenging environments for formal learning.Download Free PDFView PDFSoft is hard and hard is easy: learning technologies and social mediaJon DronDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
