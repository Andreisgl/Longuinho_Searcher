This article suggests several new arguments for the possibility of seeing some continuity between the 18 th century BCE Amorites and the 12 th century BCE Arameans. First, the geographical habitat of the various Amorite Bensimʾalite and Benjaminite tribes and the Aramean tribal conglomerates is compared. Second, the pattern of migration of the Amorite and Aramean tribes is analyzed. Third, some common linguistic elements are enumerated, like the terms Aḫlamū and Sutū found among the Amorites and the Arameans. Fourth, the attempt of some scholars to place the Hebrew ancestors among the Aramean tribes in Northern Syria is discussed. And fifth, some matrimonial institutions, customs, social and linguistic phenomena common to the Amorites and the Hebrews are pointed out attesting to a cultural continuity of certain practices spanning several centuries.Download Free PDFView PDFIs There a Connection Between the Amorites and Arameans?

Understanding the resettlement of this region—the recovery of complex societies following collapse—has emerged as a major research question in Near Eastern archaeology. Recent studies have employed two models of political regeneration: 1) “template regeneration,” whereby the renewed society follows the same pattern that a society in the same area had before the collapse and 2) “rural resiliency,” whereby the collapse of urban settlements was epiphenomenal and a resilient rural and tribal base allowed for settlement continuity and the regeneration of urban society. This article proposes a different model and argues that this resettlement involved the creation of a new type of polity, the tribal kingdom, which employed novel political, economic and cultural strategies. Tribal kingdoms were characterized by the rise of tribal confederacies, changing mobility patterns, changes in social structure, and new economic systems that used the steppe in different ways, all of which transformed settlements of all sizes as well as the relationships between them. Although these tribal kingdoms sought to establish their hegemony (in a Gramscian sense) partly by appealing to historical precedents, particularly the Akkadian Empire, they did not simply revive third millennium political practices. Similarly, although continuity is evident in some centers, survey and excavation data reveal that the overall settlement systems in Northern Mesopotamia were transformed between the third and second millennia. As a result, this article emphasizes the importance of discontinuity in the archaeological and historical record, in contrast to the usual emphasis on continuity, maintenance and the longue durée in complex societies following their emergence.Download Free PDFView PDFClaroscuro 18 Vol. 2About the mātum in Early Second Millennium Middle Euphrates Region.

Strawn, Bill T.  Arnold, Christopher B. Hays, Lawson Younger, Christopher Rollston, Joel S Burnett, Carl S Ehrlich, Pierre  BriantLeading Experts Introduce the People and Contexts of the Old Testament What people groups interacted with ancient Israel? Who were the Hurrians and why do they matter? What do we know about the Philistines, the Egyptians, the Amorites, the Assyrians, the Babylonians, and others? In this up-to-date volume, leading experts introduce the peoples and places of the world around the Old Testament, providing students with a fresh exploration of the ancient Near East. The contributors offer comprehensive orientations to the main cultures and people groups that surrounded ancient Israel in the wider ancient Near East, including not only Mesopotamia and the northern Levant but also Egypt, Arabia, and Greece. They also explore the contributions of each people group or culture to our understanding of the Hebrew Scriptures. This supplementary text is organized by geographic region, making it especially suitable for the classroom and useful in a variety of Old Testament courses. Approximately eighty-five illustrative items are included throughout the book. Contents Introduction Bill T. Arnold and Brent A. Strawn 1. The Amorites Daniel E. Fleming 2.

Journal of Archaeological Research 27: 391–449.Emily  HammerIn this paper, we present a history of pastoralism in the ancient Near East from the Neolithic through the Bronze Age. We describe the accretional development of pastoral technologies over eight millennia, including the productive breeding of domestic sheep, goats, and cattle in the early Neolithic and the subsequent domestication of animals used primarily for labor—donkeys, horses, and finally camels—as well as the first appearance of husbandry strategies such as penning, foddering, pastur-ing, young male culling, and dairy production. Despite frequent references in the literature to prehistoric pastoral nomads, pastoralism in Southwest Asia was strongly associated with sedentary communities that practiced intensive plant cultivation and was largely local in nature. There is very little evidence in prehistoric and early historic Southwest Asia to support the notion of a " dimorphic society " characterized by separate and specialized agriculturists and mobile pastoralists. Although mobile herders were present in the steppe regions of Syria by the early second millennium BC, mobile pastoralism was the exception rather than the rule at that time; its " identification " in the archaeological record frequently derives from the application of anachronistic ethnographic analogy. We conclude that pastoralism was a diverse, flexible, and dynamic adaptation in the ancient Near East and call for a reinvigorated and empirically based archaeology of pastoralism in Southwest Asia.Download Free PDFView PDFThe History of Ancient Mesopotamia: An Overview'Afnan  ShohelDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
