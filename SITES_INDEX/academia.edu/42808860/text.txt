Dugga, Mufunanji  Magalasi, folarin shyllonThe study, using documented sources and survey research of selected African States, produces an inventory of activities on the protection of cultural goods in Africa, including the return of those stolen or illicitly exported in addition to the fight against illicit trafficking of those (under negotiation or ongoing), implemented after 2002 when the African Union emerged. These include those defined by the 1954 Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict, 1970 UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property; the 1995 UNIDROIT Convention on Stolen or Illegally Exported Cultural Objects and the 2005 Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions. Ironically, the study shows that in spite of the enormous gains the various African nations stand to gain from full implementation of these conventions, not many countries have ratified these conventions. Consequently, the political will, administrative support, institutional and legislative frameworks in place to control illicit export or rehabilitate destroyed natural and cultural sites differ from one African nation to the other. This variance is partly responsible for the seeming minimal successes in the fight against illicit trade in African cultural goods as well as the relative low number of illegally exported cultural goods in Europe and America so far returned to their original communities in Africa. The study documents the number of Conventions and how African Member States that have joined them; domesticated or failed to domesticate them in their national laws; and provides an inventory of cultural goods repatriated from European Union Member States and the means of facilitation of the return. A survey of stakeholders in the cultural industry helps to provide an inventory of activities carried out by various countries towards protecting their cultural heritage. An audit of training imperatives emerges the survey and proposal for inventorying and digitization of cultural objects is made. The study presents a picture of the situation in the continent regarding the often- neglected underwater cultural goods. Finally, recommendations for future work are made both for the African Union Commission and for African Union Member States.Download Free PDFView PDFLegislation as an Instrument in South African Heritage Management: Is It Effective?Ndukuyakhe NdlovuHeritage management and cultural legislation have always existed in the African continent, even before the days of written laws. However, it is often perceived that it was with the ‘taking over’ of the continent that civilization and heritage legislation were first implemented. The ‘new’ legislation did not recognize the indigenous means of management and ignored the fact that heritage sites have existed long prior to the scramble for the continent. The first enacted legislation in South Africa was distinctively biased towards the Bushmen heritage. I argue that this was probably because it was not politically problematic as Bushmen were considered to be a dying nation with a culture going ‘extinct’. Having legislation that promoted the heritage of the people you were colonizing might not have been strategically correct. Legislation over the years moved away from the ‘Bushmen culture’ to protecting colonial heritage sites. Whilst the post-colonial heritage legislation has improved on the previous legislation — as can be shown by its success in courts — there are still areas of concern. I fi nd the whole heritage framework represented by the legislation to still be clearly non-African, with a top-down approach that has not much respect for African culture, especially the values that clash with Eurocentric ones. I conclude that indeed there has been significant progress made with legislation over the years, from 1911 to 1999 when the current legislation was promulgated. However, a lack of proactive measures from within heritage management, as well as external factors, are still a stumbling block to a successful implementation of heritage legislation and as a result heritage is still threatened. keywords Legislation, Bushmen, Enforcement, South Africa, Heritage ManagementDownload Free PDFView PDFA Museum for Sierra Leone?
