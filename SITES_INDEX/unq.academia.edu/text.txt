We frame the discussion in terms of image-schemas in cognitive semantics and their disruption stemmingfrom supraduality and nonorientability. We present the relation with anholonomic phases, chaos and the brain-mind asan integrated dynamical system. We discuss nonorientability as the characteristic transcendental metapattern of resonantconnection, pattern formation and recognition. We present the torsion geometry and nonorientability in psychophysicsand the neurosciences. We discuss the homology of the torsion geometry of physical space or spacetime with that of theunconscious modelization by the brain-mind of the kinematics of objects in physical space and in the perception ofmusic, elaborating on the Principle of Complementarity of cognitive psychology due to Shepard. We elaborate on thephenomenological construal of experience, the world as experience. We discuss the supraduality of the liminal states ofconsciousness and the basis of awareness in memory. We introduce the cognitive psychology foundations of memoryon nonorientability and its relations to the short-memory space and its quantumlike nature, and the hyperbolicity of thepsychophysics of vision. We discuss the chaotic behaviour of dynamical systems as a manifestation of supraduality astheir nonorientability. We propose a basis for the source of consciousness, the Hard Problem, given by the principles ofselfreference and hetero-reference which generate the Klein Bottle supradual logophysics. We present the supraduallogophysics of neuron cytoskeletal structures, its relation to torsion, resonances, topological and geometrical phases andthe microtubule dynamics in terms of nonlinear buckling patterns and nonorientability, and still the torsion geometry ofthe irreversible thermodynamical processes supporting interactions-at-a-distance. We discuss the primal relation oftorsion, nonorientability and memory, particularly arising in the buckling of microtubules. We discuss the primalmorphogenesis of the cell as a tensegrity structure, torsion and the indiscernibility of elastodynamics, electromagneticand gravitational wavefronts as morphogenetic fields. We discuss nonorientability as the metaform pattern of connectionand resonance, particularly of interaction-at-a-distance. We apply it to a topological allosteric effect mediated byelectromagnetic fields. We discuss the topological chemistry paradigm, particularly of organic chemistry whereconformation superposition is crucial, its relation to anaesthetics and its application to the ORC OR theory of Penroseand Hameroff for consciousness as arising from the collapse of the wave function which we relate to themulticonformation in the topological chemistry paradigm.We propose a model of continuous signal processing in digitalterms which allows an optimal reconstruction -from digital to continuous- in terms of the Nyquist-Shannon theoremwhose constraints on frequencies and bandwidths is naturally interpreted in the terms of the 2:1 harmonics ofnonorientability in the Möbius strip or Klein Bottle. We discuss the non-dual logic of the tubulin code and the resonatornature of the neuronal cytoskeleton. We propose that the topological phases appearing in the cytoskeleton maycorrespond to the topological anholonomity, namely, nonorientability, as was elicited empirically by the Bandyopadhyaygroup, the existence of anholonomity corresponding to the 360° rotation characteristic of the topological anholonomity,Möbius strip. We propose the Matrix Logic representation of the Klein Bottle logic as the basis for microtubulecomputations, and discuss the relation to quantum computation, topological entanglement and the topologicalcoherence/decoherence Klein Bottle cycle. We also relate it to holography, the brain’s integration and Velmans’Reflexive Monism extended by Rapoport. We discuss the multiconformation orientable and nonorientable resonatorselectronic devices and antennas as classical-quantum realisations of microtubule coherent behaviour. We discuss therelation of life and consciousness and the topological nonorientable embodiment of memory. We introduce thedynamical reduction program for the collapse of the quantum state in terms of the torsion stochastic differential geometryof the quantum geometry of Quantum Mechanics as projective space, and particularly the stochastic extension of theSchroedinger equation to account for the coupling of quantum system and environment, say a measurement apparatus Thus we identify a realisation of the dynamical reduction program which is based on the torsion geometry, yet supportsan agent-free collapse of the quantum state, as an objective albeit random process due to quantum fluctuations. We shalldiscuss the present supradual logophysics in several aspects such as 1) microtubule structure and dynamics, 2) theorientable and nonorientable conformations of organic molecules, 3) the relation with anaesthetics and the altered statesof consciousness and 4) confront them with the tenets of Penrose & Hameroff ORC OR theory for the origin ofconsciousness, not only the topological chemistry but their choice of a superposition of null torsion as in GeneralRelativity, which renders a trivial selfreferentiality, with the topological chemistry multiconformations which requiresnon-null torsion. The nontrivial selfreferentiality is both proper to the mind and the torsion geometry, be that on thephysical, chemical, perceptual or cognitive domains. All in all, we propose that consciousness is neither based onpanpsychism nor the collapse of quantum states, nor exclusively on the control of superposition of conformations oforganic chemistry, but rather on the torsion-nonorientable geometry-topology based on the principles of selfreferenceand hetero-reference, operating in all domains: that of meaning,the mental-anatomical-physiological domain, structuralprocesses of matter energy and in-formation, be that physical, chemical, biological, cognitive and perception. We presenta remarkable connection between them. Our approach rather than multidisciplinary will be transdisciplinary, apossibility supported on supraduality - transcending the dual-logic based logophysics- from which the theory will followin a rather smooth waySave to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Meaning -and feeling- which is wholly absent in the attempts to produce a theory for consciousness receive primacy in this setting, and related to the Klein and HyperKlein Bottle extensions of selreference and heteroreference. We discuss their bearing in relation with linguistics and the generation of culture.We discuss their fundamental relevance to Peirce&amp;#39;s triad, placing Feeling and its supraduality at the basis of this logophysics, rather than procuring Quantum Mechanics as the basic setting which also is connected to the Klein bottle logophysics. We propose this logophysics as the basic principle of an ecological psyche, first introduced by JJ Gibson. We discuss Goethe&amp;#39;s theory of colours in terms of this supradual logophysics. We propose a supradual monism and apply it to cognitive mappings retaking Shepard&amp;#39;s work in terms of symmetry Lie groups and projective spaces, the former basic to Klein&amp;#39;s Erlanger Program and basic to theoretical physics. We relate this to non-orientability as the basis for pattern formation and recognition, and the cognitive map, and the embeddedness in Euclidean space rather than projectivity as the ultimate foundation for modeling.

We introduce LGP through the subversion of the fixed dualistic categories of exterior and interior, basis for much of science, in terms of the eversion: turning inside-out of the two dimensional elastic sphere (ovum), which is the actual case. We propose bauplans unfolding from a 6d space in which time waves manifest through torsion fields in real space and in which the eversion is mediated by KBs. We present the torsion geometry, quantum and elastodynamical, of self-referential biology. We apply this to the problem of the physics of embryological differentiation in terms of quantum torsion-elastodynamics waves and the light tensegrity of the cell.

This conception stems from the self-referential construction of spacetime through torsion fields and its singularities; in particular the photon&#39;s self-referential character, basic to the embodiment of cognition ; we shall elaborate this in detail in perception and neurology.

With recent discoveries of exoplanets in our galaxy and beyond, this Astrophysics quantization issue has attracted numerous discussions in the past few years. Most chapters in this book come from published papers in various peer-reviewed journals, and they cover different methods to describe quantization, including Weyl geometry, Supersymmetry, generalized Schrödinger, and Cartan torsion method. In some chapters Navier-Stokes equations are also discussed, because it is likely that this theory will remain relevant in Astrophysics and Cosmology While much of the arguments presented in this book are theoretical, nonetheless we recommend further observation in order to verify or refute the propositions described herein. It is of our hope that this volume could open a new chapter in our knowledge on the formation and structure of Astrophysical systems. The present book is also intended for young physicist and math fellows who perhaps will find the arguments described here are at least worth pondering.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
