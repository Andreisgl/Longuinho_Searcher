Many passages of the text are a matter of controversy among scholars, to the point that there is no consensus on the genre of the text itself. In this article, I draw on examples from Ancient Near Eastern literature in order to clarify the meaning of given passages of the text (lines 10 and 38) and, thus, contribute to its full comprehension.Download Free PDFView PDFArchiv für Orientforschung 55 Marduk Saves the Dead in his Palms – Syntax Analysis of Ludlul bēl nēmeqi I 9–12,2022 • Takayoshi  OshimaDownload Free PDFView PDFRevue d'Assyriologie 7 RA 107-2013- FROM THE COLLECTIONS OF AN OLD BABYLONIAN LITERARY CONNOISSEUR2013 • Piotr MichalowskiDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Hellenic Studies 135 (2015) 110-131The ϝhεδιέστας inscription from archaic Argos: (SEG 11:314): a reconsideration (in JHS 2015)2015 • Eleanor DickeyThis article offers a re-edition of SEG 11:314, Argos inventory number E274, based on re-examination of the stone and of recently-rediscovered squeezes preserving material now lost from the stone; these allow improved readings in numerous places. We also offer a re-interpretation of the disputed syntax of the last three lines, which we translate 'As for the things with which a δαμιοργός is to compel (him to make amends), the ἀμφίπολος is to give thought to these things'.Download Free PDFView PDFR.

Cultural Anthropology and Ethnosemiotics, Vol 3, № 1; pp.: 35 - 41Some notes on the grammatical structure of a verb from a Minoan incantation from London Medicine PapyrusAlexander AkulovWord sabujajəjədja from a Minoan incantation from London Medicine Papyrus is a verb of movement. Its ending: -ja (actually-sha) correlates with -se of Phaistos disc. This-se correlates with Hattic -aš, which correlates with Kabardinian -ś. Kabardinian -ś expresses affirmative mood, so Hattic -aš, -se of Phaistos disc, -sha of the incantation express alike meanings: affirmative/optative. (Previously has been found serious resemblance of Hattic verbal grammar and that of Phaistos disc idiom; also has been proved relatedness of Hattic and Kabardinian). Component sa of sabujajəjədja correlates with Hattic negative prefix šaš. Component bu can be a marker of agent or a compound of agent and patient markers. The rest part of the word: jajəjəd is left-handed triplication of jed that is the main root and that probably means " to approach ". In current context triplication means intensifying. Thus, sabujajəjədja probably means " let it not to approach " .Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
