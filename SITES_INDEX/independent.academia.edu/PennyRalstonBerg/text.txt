Students were categorized into three groups: traditional, moderately nontraditional, and highly nontraditional. A survey instrument designed to assess online course quality and other demographic characteristics was administered electronically. Course quality was measured using the rubric associated with the eight Quality Matters (2008-2010) standards. A total of 3,160 students enrolled in at least one online for-credit course from 31 colleges and universities across the U.S. participated in this study. Based on the results of a series of ANOVAs, it was found that both traditional and nontraditional students rated Standard 3 on Assessment and Measurement as highest among the eight standards. No significant differences between student groups were found. In addition, there were no significant differences between groups for Standard 8 on Accessibility.

While certainly concerns about the efficacy of learning online have not fully gone away, online courses, and often entire online degrees, are now an established part of the contemporary higher education landscape. At the same time, persistence and retention remain important areas of concern for both online learners and the higher education institutions serving them. In this paper, we will identify some of the key challenges adult online learners face, suggest an integrated model for approaching the retention of online learners, and offer specific examples of services and interventions to help with online retention.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The 43-item survey instrument measured students’ perceptions of online course quality. The effect of age and employment status on their perceptions was measured. Based on a series of ANOVA (analysis of variance)s, it was found that the highest rated standard was QM3 on Assessment and Measurement. There were significant differences between age groups. Students under 45, contrasted to those over 45, highly valued clarity and appropriateness of assessments and clear criteria for grading. For students above the age of 45, QM6 on Course Technology was valued highest. They placed a high value on the tools and media that support learning objectives and classmate interactivity. QM3 was rated highest across all employment groups—those employed part-time, full-time, and those who were unemployed. Standards 1 (Course Overview and Introduction), 2 (Learning Objectives), 4 (Resources and Materials), and 7 (Learner Support) were valued higher by students working full-time and those who were unemployed compared with those working part-time. It is likely that students who work part-time are not as focused on academics as are those who do not work. They may not be as motivated to perform well as students who work full-time. Implications for course designers and instructors are discussed.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Overall, 3,160 online students completed a survey which asked them to indicate the extent to which statements derived from the Quality Matters rubric contributed to student success. The results indicate that students rated some items differently based on their previous online course experience. Novice online learners felt that having netiquette guidelines clearly stated was more important than experienced online learners. Experienced learners rated several items as being more important than novice and/or intermediate online learners, including items related to self-introductions, appropriateness of assessments, r...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The explosion of online higher education and unbounded advances in technology provide examples and rationale for why faculty development for e-learning is needed. Literature on faculty development and e-learning is reviewed and a multi-campus faculty development program using distance technology and a community of practice model for nursing educators will be described. Successful strategies, barriers and an evaluation of the multi-campus faculty development model experience will be presented in a format that allows for replication across disciplines.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

When compared to the traditional classroom, E-learning requires greater collaboration among team members and use of different teaching and learning strategies. Pedagogy as well as team configurations must change when moving to the online environment. Collaboration is a key component in creating quality E-learning. Effective collaboration requires faculty to understand various roles (e.g., instructional designers, multimedia specialists), and activities involved in e-learning as well as how professionals in different roles work together. This article discusses the use of an E-Learning framework and development of a survey based on the framework’s dimensions as two strategies to broaden faculty understanding of E-Learning collaboration. The survey was used to expose faculty across five Midwestern campuses to all dimensions of E-learning including areas such as management, ethics, and interface design.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
