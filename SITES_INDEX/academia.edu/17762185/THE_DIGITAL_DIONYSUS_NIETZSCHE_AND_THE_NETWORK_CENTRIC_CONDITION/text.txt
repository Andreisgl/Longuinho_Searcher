Essential reading for all those interested in Nietzsche and contemporary culture alike”—Peter R. Sedgwick, Cardiff University, School of English, Communication & Philosophy. // “Dan Mellamphy and Nandita Biswas Mellamphy have staged a brilliant collaboration among critical theorists from a range of disciplines to explore the import of Nietzschean thought for contemporary issues in media, technologies and digitization. The result is The Digital Dionysus, a must-read for scholars in media, aesthetics, politics, and philosophy”—Patricia Ticineto Clough, The Graduate Center, City University of New York. // “The ubiquity of digital networks would seem to constitute the triumph and culmination of Apollonian reason in the imposition of forms of cybernetic command-and-control systems. With The Digital Dionysus, however, Dan Mellamphy and Nandita Biswas Mellamphy flip this assumption on its head. Through the typically untimely introduction of Friedrich Nietzsche, the philosopher most attentive to the inherent irrationality of reason, this remarkable book brings together some of the most exciting authors of recent years from the fields of politics, philosophy, art, and media, to gaze into the depths of the screen conjuring the tumultuous world of multiple, networked becomings, techno-bodies teeming at the event-horizon of the informational abyss. Beware: this is not a Nietzsche sanitized for an age of cyber-utopias; these authors are acutely attuned to the threat as well as the promise of those digital monsters incubating in the humming of machines”—Scott Wilson, Kingston University, School of Humanities, Media & Cultural Studies.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersNietzsche and Networks, Nietzschean Networks: The Digital Dionysus (introduction).Dan Mellamphy, Nandita Biswas Mellamphy (Western University, London)Editors’ Introduction to THE DIGITAL DIONYSUS: NIETZSCHE AND THE NETWORK-CENTRIC CONDITION (New York: Punctum Books, 2015).Download Free PDFView PDFCritical Posthumanism and Planetary Futures, eds.

Hence, the suggestion is to address the question of “Nietzsche and Humanity” tackling it from the problem of subjectivity, i.e. human psycho-social subjectivity in its individual and collective forms. The intention is thus to demonstrate that Nietzsche offers a theory of subjectivity, his critique of the soul, subject and ego notwithstanding.

H. LawrenceVesna Stanković PejnovićThis paper analyses Friedrich Nietzsche's understanding of power as the will to power, of autonomy as self-becoming, and of dominance as self-overcoming. Wandering through the main thoughts of D. H. Lawrence's novel Sons and Lovers, this paper draws upon the main pillars of Nietzsche's philosophy and tries to ponder Nietzsche's understanding of power and his comprehension of any will to power. Nietzsche's understanding of the will to power is closely related to the process of the affirmation of life, the struggle for the achievement of nobility of spirit, struggle for the achievement of becoming " poets of our lives " and for creating law for ourselves, and to a constant struggle with life for life itself. Lawrence portrays the same perspective through the eyes of an artist, abounding with philosophical and psychological connotations. Lawrence provides his readers with a Nietzschean perspective of free spirits who try to overcome themselves and to create their own law for self-dominance and dominance over the world.Download Free PDFView PDFDiscourseZarathustran Bird Wars: Hitchcock's" Nietzsche" and the Teletechnic Loop2010 • Tom  CohenDownload Free PDFView PDFNietzsche in ItalyThomas HarrisonLong since out of print, this volume collects 23 original essays by Agamben, Colli, Girard, Harrison (RP and T), Magris, Montinari, Nancy, Serres, Vattimo, and others.Download Free PDFView PDFThe Technological Introject: Friedrich Kittler between Implementation and the Incalculable, Fordham University PressLamenting the Voice Behind the Chair2018 • Nimrod  ReitmanDownload Free PDFView PDFThe Birth of Tragedy from the Spirit of Music2005 • Kathleen HigginsDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
