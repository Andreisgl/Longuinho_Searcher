The modern West is unique in having produced the only psychology that consciously severed itself from metaphysics and spiritual principles. The momentous intellectual revolutions inaugurated by the Renaissance and the European Enlightenment further entrenched the prejudices of its purely secular and reductionist approach. Yet, across the diverse cultures of the world, we find spiritual traditions that embrace a fully-integrated psychology, unsullied by the limitations of the modern scientific method. It is only by grounding psychology on a foundation of sacred and universal truths—found in all traditional civilizations—that we can begin to restore a true “science of the soul” that addresses the entire gamut of human needs and possibilities.Download Free PDFView PDF The Mountain PathRené Guénon and Sri Ramana Maharshi: Two Remarkable Sages in Modern Times (Part III)Samuel Bendeck SotillosDownload Free PDFView PDFThe Mountain PathRené Guénon and Sri Ramana Maharshi: Two Remarkable Sages in Modern Times (Part IV)Samuel Bendeck SotillosDownload Free PDFView PDFSacred Web: A Journal of Tradition and ModernityBook Review – The Science of the Greater Jihad: Essays in Principial PsychologySamuel Bendeck SotillosDownload Free PDFView PDFThe Mountain PathRené Guénon and Sri Ramana Maharshi: Two Remarkable Sages in Modern Times (Part I)Samuel Bendeck SotillosDownload Free PDFView PDFThe Mountain PathRené Guénon and Sri Ramana Maharshi: Two Remarkable Sages in Modern Times (Part II)Samuel Bendeck SotillosDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Transpersonal PsychologyReview of "Psychology and the Perennial Philosophy," by Mateus Soares de Azevedo, Journal of Transpersonal Psychology, Vol. 48, No. 1 (2016), pp. 118–122.Samuel Bendeck SotillosDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
