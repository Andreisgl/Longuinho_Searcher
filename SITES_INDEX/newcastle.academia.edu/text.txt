Richard  ElliottNewcastle University,  International Centre for Music Studies,  Faculty MemberMusicology+77I am Senior Lecturer in Music in the International Centre for Music Studies at Newcastle University. Prior to that I was based at the University of Sussex as Senior Lecturer in Popular Music. I am the author of the books Fado and the Place of Longing: Loss, Memory and the City (Ashgate, 2010), Nina Simone (Equinox, 2013), The Late Voice: Time, Age and Experience in Popular Music (Bloomsbury Academic, 2015) and The Sound of Nonsense (2018). I have also published articles, book chapters and reviews on a number of topics, including popular music, literature, consciousness, memory, nostalgia, place and space, affect, language and technology.My research interests are wide but predominantly connect to ways in which music reflects and produces time, space and memorable objects. My early work explored the roles played by loss, memory, nostalgia and revolution in popular music and was heavily influenced by theories of place and spatiality. These ideas were developed in my first book Fado and the Place of Longing, which analysed Portuguese fado music as a reflection and production of space and place.The topics of memory, nostalgia and revolution are also present in my book on Nina Simone, which combined history, biography and song analysis and which - unusually for publications about this artist - explored the whole of Simone's career. As well as attending to the often-discussed role Simone played in the civil rights era of the 1960s, I explore the artist's late style and start to outline my theory of the late voice.Another ongoing theme in my work is the various ways in which music creates or evokes ‘memory places’ that take on significance for individuals and communities. More recent work reflects music’s potential to soundtrack lives and histories; My 2015 book The Late Voice explores the representation of time, age and experience in popular song, building its narrative around extended case studies of Ralph Stanley, Frank Sinatra, Leonard Cohen, Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell and Neil Young.The Sound of Nonsense, published at the very end of 2017 (with a 2018 publication date), reflects my interest in words, music and sound studies. It brings together novelists, nonsense writers, sound poets, experimental composers, comedians and pop musicians in an attempt to get at the role of sound in creating, maintaining and disrupting meaning.My other areas of specialisation include the global span of popular music styles from the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, music and cultural theory, urban musicology, the poetics of song and the politics of authenticity. I have a background in a variety of disciplines, having gained a Bachelor’s degree in Comparative American Studies, a Master’s in Popular Culture and a PhD in Music.I am currently conducting research on the materiality of song and on the representation of global popular musics in the phonographic era. Since early 2018 I have not been posting new work to this site.

These DJs and producers have brought the sound of the Lisbon projects to the wider world via international club nights, festival appearances, recordings and remix projects for a range of international artists. This book uses the 2006 compilation DJs do Guetto as a prism for exploring this music's aesthetics and its roots in Lusophone Africa, its evolution in the immigrant communities of Lisbon and its journey from there to the world. The story is one of encounters: between people, sounds, neighborhoods, technologies and cultural contexts. Drawing on reflections by DJ Marfox and others, the book establishes DJs do Guetto as a foundation stone not only for a burgeoning music scene, but also for a newfound sense of pride in a place and a community.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The Late Voice undertakes such an analysis by considering issues of time, memory, innocence and experience in modern Anglophone popular song and the use by singers and songwriters of a 'late voice'. Lateness here refers to five primary issues: chronology (the stage in an artist's career); the vocal act (the ability to convincingly portray experience); afterlife (posthumous careers made possible by recorded sound); retrospection (how voices 'look back' or anticipate looking back); and the writing of age, experience, lateness and loss into song texts. There has been recent growth in research on ageing and the experience of later stages of life, focussing on physical health, lifestyle and psychology, with work in the latter field intersecting with the field of memory studies. The Late Voice seeks to connect age, experience and lateness with particular performers and performance traditions via the identification and analysis of a late voice in singers and songwriters of mid-late twentieth century popular music. Contents:IntroductionChapter 1: Time, Age, Experience and VoiceChapter 2: ‘Won't You Spare Me Over till Another Year?’: Ralph Stanley’s Late VoiceChapter 3: September of My Years: Age and Experience in the Work of Frank Sinatra and Leonard CohenChapter 4: Time Out of Mind: Bob Dylan, Age and Those Same Distant PlacesChapter 5: Both Sides Now: Joni Mitchell, Neil Young and the Innocence and Experience of the Singer-SongwriterConclusion: Late ThoughtsBibliography Discography Videography IndexSave to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Much of her fame derives from her association with the civil rights movement, for which she wrote such classic songs as ‘Mississippi Goddam’, ‘Four Women’ and ‘Young, Gifted and Black’. The defiance and affirmation of such anthems was accompanied by an equal dedication to songs of melancholy, yearning and spiritual questing. Placing Simone and her music firmly within the socio-historical context of the 1960s, this book also argues for the importance of considering the artist’s entire career and for paying greater attention to her music than is often the case in biographical accounts. Simone defied musical categories even as she fought against social ones and the result is a body of work that draws upon classical and jazz music, country blues, French chanson, gospel, protest songs, pop and rock tunes, turning genres and styles inside out in pursuit of what Simone called “black classical music”. The book begins with a focus on the early part of Simone’s career and a discussion of genre and style. Connecting its analysis to a discussion of social categorization (with particular regard to race), it argues that Simone's defiance of stylistic boundaries can be seen as a political act. From here, the focus shifts to Simone’s self-written protest material, connecting it to her increasing involvement in the struggle for civil rights. The book also provides an in-depth account of Simone's 'possession' of material by writers such as Leonard Cohen, Bob Dylan, Sandy Denny and Judy Collins, while exploring the relationship between the personal and the political. In considering material from the Simone's lesser-known work from the 1970s to the 1990s, the study proposes a theory of the “late voice” in which issues of age, experience and memory are emphasised. The book concludes with a discussion of Simone's ongoing legacy."""Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It is known for its strong emphasis on loss, memory and nostalgia within its song texts, which often refer to absent people and places. One of the main lyrical themes of fado is the city itself. Fado music has played a significant role in the interlacing of mythology, history, memory and regionalism in Portugal in the second half of the twentieth century. Fado and the Place of Longing considers the ways in which fado songs bear witness to the city of Lisbon, in relation to the idea of construction and maintenance of the local. The book explores the ways in which fado acts as a cultural product reaffirming local identity via recourse to social memory and an imagined community, while also providing a distinctive cultural export for the dissemination of a 'remembered Portugal' on the global stage.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Essays, Articles, ChaptersBrilliant Disguises: Persona, Autobiography and the Magic of Retrospection in Bruce Springsteen’s Late CareerPersona Studies,  2019Popular musicians with long careers provide rich source material for the study of persona, authen... more Popular musicians with long careers provide rich source material for the study of persona, authenticity, endurance and the maintenance (and reinvention) of significant bodies of work. The songs of successful artists create a soundtrack not only to their own lives, but also to those of their audiences, and to the times in which they were created and to which they bore witness. The work of singers who continue to perform after several decades can be heard in terms of their 'late voice' (Elliott 2015a), a concept that has potentially useful insights for the study of musical persona. This article exploits this potential by considering how musical persona is de-and reconstructed in performance. I base my articulation of the relationship between persona, life-writing and retrospective narrativity on a close reading of two late texts by Bruce Springsteen: Born to Run, the autobiography he published in 2016, and Springsteen on Broadway, the audiovisual record of a show that ran from October 2017 to December 2018. In these texts, Springsteen uses the metaphor of the 'magic trick' as a framing device to shuttle between the roles of autobiographical myth-breaker and lyrical protagonist. He repeatedly highlights his songs as fictions that bear little relation to his actual life, while also showing awareness that, as often happens with popular song, he has been mapped onto his characters in ways that prove vital for their sense of authenticity. Yet Springsteen appears to be aiming for a different kind of authenticity with these late texts, by supplementing the persona developed in his earlier career with an older, wiser, more playful narrator. I appropriate Springsteen's 'magic trick' metaphor to highlight the magic of retrospection and the magical formation of the life narrative as an end-driven process.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Having established three main ways in which this is a speculative approach, it then explores gaps in existing theories of posthumanism and Afrofuturism. It also considers work that addresses the omission of female musicians in Afrofuturist theory and proposes alternative theories in the form of speculative fiction and Black utopias. The article discusses Simone’s frequent allusions to Egyptian myth, her self-identification as a ‘robot’ and her interest in other planets, planes and spheres. It argues that, beyond the unexplored parallels with ‘classic’ Afrofuturism, there is a sense of dystopianism, apocalypse and reterritorialization throughout Simone’s mature work. To explore these connections, three case studies are used: the 1969 album Nina Simone and Piano!, the song ‘22nd Century’, and Simone’s performance at the 1976 Montreux Jazz Festival.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The book is organised according to a ‘visualist’ logic and does not address sound as a way of understanding our environment. This article takes Species of Spaces as an invitation to consider ‘species of sonic space’, a variety of related chunks of the sonic environment we share. It asks how we might explore the sonic environment by way of Perec’s text and through consideration of other spaces which Perec does not discuss. It reflects on existing attempts to think of sonic spaces and on the differences between describing sonic, visual and other felt spaces. Aspects of Perec’s text lend themselves to comparison with other writers’ attempts to bring sound and space together: his analysis of domestic spaces can be usefully placed alongside Gaston Bachelard’s work on ‘the poetics of space’; his descriptions of urban rhythms can be compared to those of Henri Lefebvre; his attention to interiority can be considered in light of Peter Sloterdijk’s ‘microspherology’; and his division of space into species find a potentially productive aural analogue in Brandon LaBelle’s account of ‘acoustic territories’. These and other thinkers are considered here as ways of setting up an ‘auralisation’ of Species of Spaces. The role of sound in Perec’s A Man Asleep (1967), An Attempt at Exhausting a Place in Paris (2010) and Life a User’s Manual (1978) is also discussed. These works, it is argued, extend, develop, anticipate or reverberate with Species of Spaces in ways that are useful for auralising that text.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It connects some of the dots between the worlds of John Cage and a branch of hip hop occasionally referred to as ‘noise hop’. It uses Cage's tape composition Williams Mix (1951-1953) as a connecting point between the experimental art music world of the 1950s and the ‘alternative’ hip hop world of the 2010s, as Williams Mix becomes ‘Williams Mix’, a track on the second album by the Los Angeles-based group clipping.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Taking as a starting point the song ‘O Death’, the chapter examines discourse around Stanley’s age and the ways in which age is witnessed in his voice. I provide an overview of Stanley’s career, followed by a discussion of different versions of ‘O Death’. I also consider the relationship between the particular and the universal and between the individual and the community.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
'Words Take the Place of Meaning': Sound, Sense and Politics in the Music of Robert WyattThe Singer-Songwriter in Europe: Paradigms, Politics and Place, edited by Isabelle Marc and Stuart Green,  Mar 2016When we speak of singer-songwriters we tend to consider voice as both literary tool and musical i... more When we speak of singer-songwriters we tend to consider voice as both literary tool and musical instrument, and of the resulting persona(s) of an author and a vocalist. In the case of British musician Robert Wyatt, both writing style and vocal instrument are utterly distinctive and this combined ‘voice’ has served to mediate, and occasionally muddy, the already playful relationship between words and music in Wyatt’s work. Much of his own songwriting, with its predilections for nonsense and the absurd, is articulated via a childlike sense of wonder at the world and a desire to cling to domestic comforts. This is supplemented by a more explicitly political body of work, reflecting Wyatt’s engagement with left wing politics and an ever-increasing geo-political outlook. This political work takes the form of both self-written material and cover versions of work by international singer-songwriters, a process which contributes to a global network of committed music.This chapter discusses songs from both these sides of Wyatt’s repertoire to explore the relationships between the cultural geographies of singer-songwriters and protest as articulated via words and sound. I begin by considering Wyatt in light of dominant definitions of the singer-songwriter, particularly those that seek some kind of transparent mediation between the artist’s life and their work. Wyatt challenges such notions through his use of word games, coded lyrics or languages that are foreign to him and which arguably lack the sense of authenticity required for the direct address of the confessional singer-songwriter or the protest singer. Furthermore, Wyatt’s art has been as much about sound in general as about music (and in ways that challenge rather than reinforce distinctions between these terms) and, to this end, I include a brief discussion of sound poetry as a way of considering the sometimes problematic relationship between sound and sense. I link this discussion to one of Wyatt’s political songs, ‘Gharbzadegi’, which takes its name from an Iranian term meaning ‘Westernitis’ or ‘infected by the West’ but which Wyatt’s non-Iranian listeners are unlikely to make sense of without additional guidance. I argue there is a tension between language terms and their meanings which is of interest to discussions of confessional or political singer-songwriters, where we would probably expect there to be a more transparent sense of meaning in the words being sung.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
‘My Tongue Gets t-t-t-’: Words, Sense, and Vocal Presence in Van Morrison’s It’s Too Late to Stop NowVan Morrison’s live version of his song ‘Cyprus Avenue’ on the 1974 album It’s Too Late to Stop N... more Van Morrison’s live version of his song ‘Cyprus Avenue’ on the 1974 album It’s Too Late to Stop Now provides an example of the authority of the singer’s voice and of how it leads and demands submission from musicians, songs, and audience. Morrison’s voice constantly suggests that it is reflecting important experience and can be understood both as an attempt to capture something and as a post-hoc witnessing or testimony. Through the example of Morrison’s work, and of It’s Too Late to Stop Now in particular, this article explores the location of the voice in terms of the body and of particular places and histories. It then proceeds to a reflection on the relationship between the performing voice as producer of sound, noise, and music and the poetic voice that provides the words and visions upon which the performing voice goes to work. It concludes by focusing on a moment within ‘Cyprus Avenue’ where Morrison performs the act of being tongue-tied, discussing this as an example of ‘aesthetic stutter’. Throughout, attention is also paid to how other voices (particularly those of rock critics) connect to Morrison’s voice by attempting to describe it, re-perform it, or explain it.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Words from the New World: Adventure and Memory in Patti Smith’s Late VoicePatti Smith: Outside (edited by Claude Chastagner),  2015Patti Smith’s late work is invariably connected by critics and fans to the work of her ‘classic’ ... more Patti Smith’s late work is invariably connected by critics and fans to the work of her ‘classic’ era (the 1970s punk scene) and the extent to which recent work lives up to, develops or exceeds that on which the artist’s reputation was based. Smith herself has been no stranger to such memory work, via her involvement in biographical projects such as her book Just Kids and the film Dream of Life. Her musical output since the 1990s has been characterized by memory work, not least in a number of pieces written in response to the passing of friends and family. Yet this work is complemented by an embrace of new beginnings and adventure, often achieved by returning to places, themes and styles Smith has explored before but looking for fresh angles and new perspectives. This essay explores the dynamic of adventure and memory via analysis of Smith’s 2012 album Banga, in which this dynamic is played out in informative ways. I focus on the music of Banga too, and on the different voices utilised by Smith. In the second part of the essay, I consider the canonisation of Smith and her work in light of what I term ‘late chronicles’, a series of documents and events over the past fifteen years that have seen Smith’s work fixed into the rock canon and have provided further context to situate her work and her many cultural reference points. I finish with some further observations on Banga, filtered through the knowledge we have of Smith from the late chronicles that preceded it.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It focuses specifically on the representation of innocence and experience via the "late voice". "Lateness", a concept exemplified by these artists but which extends to a broad range of modern (post mid-twentieth century) popular musics, refers to five primary issues: chronology (the stage in an artist's career); the vocal act (the ability to convincingly portray experience); afterlife (posthumous careers made possible by phonography); retrospection (how voices "look back" or anticipate looking back); and the writing of age, experience, lateness and loss into song texts. The main case study of the chapter is the song ‘Who Knows Where the Time Goes’, written by Denny and later performed by Collins and Simone. The song is analysed in terms of its representation of time and experience and in relation to the lives and works of its interpreters.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This article examines this “nostalgia gap” alongside the analogous gap found in representation. The relationship is highlighted via an analysis of “holiday records”, a genre of recordings that became prevalent in the 1960s. The genre intersects with the more familiar genres of exotica, mood music, easy listening and ambient, but is distinguished by its emphasis on a particular form of spatial reminiscence and imagination. Using the example of “April in Portugal”, a song that started life as a Portuguese fado and subsequently became an international hit and mood music staple, I address a set of questions that illustrate the nostalgia gap. What is being remembered or imagined in the song? Can we distinguish between described and prescribed nostalgia? How is saudade, the specifically Portuguese “grammar of nostalgia”, related to nostalgic languages found on other holiday records? Qu’elle se rapporte au temps ou à l’espace, la nostalgie naît d’un écart ou fossé entre le passé que l’on désire retrouver et le moment présent du désir. À travers cet article, je me propose d’examiner le « fossé nostalgique » et le fossé de représentation. La dynamique est explorée à travers une analyse des « disques de vacances », un genre d’enregistrements devenu très en vogue dans les années 1960. Le genre se situe à la croisée des genres plus connus de l’exotica, mood music, easy listening et ambient, mais s’en distingue par l’usage spécifique qu’il fait de réminiscences géographiques et de faits fictifs. En utilisant l’exemple d’ « April in Portugal », à l’origine un fado portugais qui est par la suite devenu un tube international et un grand classique de la mood music, je réponds à une série de questions qui illustrent le fossé nostalgique. Qu’est-ce qui est effectivement remémoré, qu’est-ce qui est imaginé dans la chanson ? Peut-on établir une différence entre nostalgie « descriptive », tirée d’une expérience vécue, et nostalgie « obligatoire », ou clichée ? Quel genre de rapports la saudade, « bréviaire de la nostalgie » typique du Portugal, entretient-elle avec les types de langues nostalgiques que l’on peut trouver sur d’autres disques de vacances ?Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The Late Voice seeks to connect age, experience and lateness with particular performers and performance traditions via the identification and analysis of a late voice in singers and songwriters of mid-late twentieth century popular music. Contents:IntroductionChapter 1: Time, Age, Experience and VoiceChapter 2: ‘Won't You Spare Me Over till Another Year?’: Ralph Stanley’s Late VoiceChapter 3: September of My Years: Age and Experience in the Work of Frank Sinatra and Leonard CohenChapter 4: Time Out of Mind: Bob Dylan, Age and Those Same Distant PlacesChapter 5: Both Sides Now: Joni Mitchell, Neil Young and the Innocence and Experience of the Singer-SongwriterConclusion: Late ThoughtsBibliography Discography Videography IndexSave to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Much of her fame derives from her association with the civil rights movement, for which she wrote such classic songs as ‘Mississippi Goddam’, ‘Four Women’ and ‘Young, Gifted and Black’. The defiance and affirmation of such anthems was accompanied by an equal dedication to songs of melancholy, yearning and spiritual questing. Placing Simone and her music firmly within the socio-historical context of the 1960s, this book also argues for the importance of considering the artist’s entire career and for paying greater attention to her music than is often the case in biographical accounts. Simone defied musical categories even as she fought against social ones and the result is a body of work that draws upon classical and jazz music, country blues, French chanson, gospel, protest songs, pop and rock tunes, turning genres and styles inside out in pursuit of what Simone called “black classical music”. The book begins with a focus on the early part of Simone’s career and a discussion of genre and style. Connecting its analysis to a discussion of social categorization (with particular regard to race), it argues that Simone's defiance of stylistic boundaries can be seen as a political act. From here, the focus shifts to Simone’s self-written protest material, connecting it to her increasing involvement in the struggle for civil rights. The book also provides an in-depth account of Simone's 'possession' of material by writers such as Leonard Cohen, Bob Dylan, Sandy Denny and Judy Collins, while exploring the relationship between the personal and the political. In considering material from the Simone's lesser-known work from the 1970s to the 1990s, the study proposes a theory of the “late voice” in which issues of age, experience and memory are emphasised. The book concludes with a discussion of Simone's ongoing legacy."""Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It is known for its strong emphasis on loss, memory and nostalgia within its song texts, which often refer to absent people and places. One of the main lyrical themes of fado is the city itself. Fado music has played a significant role in the interlacing of mythology, history, memory and regionalism in Portugal in the second half of the twentieth century. Fado and the Place of Longing considers the ways in which fado songs bear witness to the city of Lisbon, in relation to the idea of construction and maintenance of the local. The book explores the ways in which fado acts as a cultural product reaffirming local identity via recourse to social memory and an imagined community, while also providing a distinctive cultural export for the dissemination of a 'remembered Portugal' on the global stage.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Brilliant Disguises: Persona, Autobiography and the Magic of Retrospection in Bruce Springsteen’s Late CareerPersona Studies,  2019Popular musicians with long careers provide rich source material for the study of persona, authen... more Popular musicians with long careers provide rich source material for the study of persona, authenticity, endurance and the maintenance (and reinvention) of significant bodies of work. The songs of successful artists create a soundtrack not only to their own lives, but also to those of their audiences, and to the times in which they were created and to which they bore witness. The work of singers who continue to perform after several decades can be heard in terms of their 'late voice' (Elliott 2015a), a concept that has potentially useful insights for the study of musical persona. This article exploits this potential by considering how musical persona is de-and reconstructed in performance. I base my articulation of the relationship between persona, life-writing and retrospective narrativity on a close reading of two late texts by Bruce Springsteen: Born to Run, the autobiography he published in 2016, and Springsteen on Broadway, the audiovisual record of a show that ran from October 2017 to December 2018. In these texts, Springsteen uses the metaphor of the 'magic trick' as a framing device to shuttle between the roles of autobiographical myth-breaker and lyrical protagonist. He repeatedly highlights his songs as fictions that bear little relation to his actual life, while also showing awareness that, as often happens with popular song, he has been mapped onto his characters in ways that prove vital for their sense of authenticity. Yet Springsteen appears to be aiming for a different kind of authenticity with these late texts, by supplementing the persona developed in his earlier career with an older, wiser, more playful narrator. I appropriate Springsteen's 'magic trick' metaphor to highlight the magic of retrospection and the magical formation of the life narrative as an end-driven process.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Having established three main ways in which this is a speculative approach, it then explores gaps in existing theories of posthumanism and Afrofuturism. It also considers work that addresses the omission of female musicians in Afrofuturist theory and proposes alternative theories in the form of speculative fiction and Black utopias. The article discusses Simone’s frequent allusions to Egyptian myth, her self-identification as a ‘robot’ and her interest in other planets, planes and spheres. It argues that, beyond the unexplored parallels with ‘classic’ Afrofuturism, there is a sense of dystopianism, apocalypse and reterritorialization throughout Simone’s mature work. To explore these connections, three case studies are used: the 1969 album Nina Simone and Piano!, the song ‘22nd Century’, and Simone’s performance at the 1976 Montreux Jazz Festival.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The book is organised according to a ‘visualist’ logic and does not address sound as a way of understanding our environment. This article takes Species of Spaces as an invitation to consider ‘species of sonic space’, a variety of related chunks of the sonic environment we share. It asks how we might explore the sonic environment by way of Perec’s text and through consideration of other spaces which Perec does not discuss. It reflects on existing attempts to think of sonic spaces and on the differences between describing sonic, visual and other felt spaces. Aspects of Perec’s text lend themselves to comparison with other writers’ attempts to bring sound and space together: his analysis of domestic spaces can be usefully placed alongside Gaston Bachelard’s work on ‘the poetics of space’; his descriptions of urban rhythms can be compared to those of Henri Lefebvre; his attention to interiority can be considered in light of Peter Sloterdijk’s ‘microspherology’; and his division of space into species find a potentially productive aural analogue in Brandon LaBelle’s account of ‘acoustic territories’. These and other thinkers are considered here as ways of setting up an ‘auralisation’ of Species of Spaces. The role of sound in Perec’s A Man Asleep (1967), An Attempt at Exhausting a Place in Paris (2010) and Life a User’s Manual (1978) is also discussed. These works, it is argued, extend, develop, anticipate or reverberate with Species of Spaces in ways that are useful for auralising that text.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

'Words Take the Place of Meaning': Sound, Sense and Politics in the Music of Robert WyattThe Singer-Songwriter in Europe: Paradigms, Politics and Place, edited by Isabelle Marc and Stuart Green,  Mar 2016When we speak of singer-songwriters we tend to consider voice as both literary tool and musical i... more When we speak of singer-songwriters we tend to consider voice as both literary tool and musical instrument, and of the resulting persona(s) of an author and a vocalist. In the case of British musician Robert Wyatt, both writing style and vocal instrument are utterly distinctive and this combined ‘voice’ has served to mediate, and occasionally muddy, the already playful relationship between words and music in Wyatt’s work. Much of his own songwriting, with its predilections for nonsense and the absurd, is articulated via a childlike sense of wonder at the world and a desire to cling to domestic comforts. This is supplemented by a more explicitly political body of work, reflecting Wyatt’s engagement with left wing politics and an ever-increasing geo-political outlook. This political work takes the form of both self-written material and cover versions of work by international singer-songwriters, a process which contributes to a global network of committed music.This chapter discusses songs from both these sides of Wyatt’s repertoire to explore the relationships between the cultural geographies of singer-songwriters and protest as articulated via words and sound. I begin by considering Wyatt in light of dominant definitions of the singer-songwriter, particularly those that seek some kind of transparent mediation between the artist’s life and their work. Wyatt challenges such notions through his use of word games, coded lyrics or languages that are foreign to him and which arguably lack the sense of authenticity required for the direct address of the confessional singer-songwriter or the protest singer. Furthermore, Wyatt’s art has been as much about sound in general as about music (and in ways that challenge rather than reinforce distinctions between these terms) and, to this end, I include a brief discussion of sound poetry as a way of considering the sometimes problematic relationship between sound and sense. I link this discussion to one of Wyatt’s political songs, ‘Gharbzadegi’, which takes its name from an Iranian term meaning ‘Westernitis’ or ‘infected by the West’ but which Wyatt’s non-Iranian listeners are unlikely to make sense of without additional guidance. I argue there is a tension between language terms and their meanings which is of interest to discussions of confessional or political singer-songwriters, where we would probably expect there to be a more transparent sense of meaning in the words being sung.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
‘My Tongue Gets t-t-t-’: Words, Sense, and Vocal Presence in Van Morrison’s It’s Too Late to Stop NowVan Morrison’s live version of his song ‘Cyprus Avenue’ on the 1974 album It’s Too Late to Stop N... more Van Morrison’s live version of his song ‘Cyprus Avenue’ on the 1974 album It’s Too Late to Stop Now provides an example of the authority of the singer’s voice and of how it leads and demands submission from musicians, songs, and audience. Morrison’s voice constantly suggests that it is reflecting important experience and can be understood both as an attempt to capture something and as a post-hoc witnessing or testimony. Through the example of Morrison’s work, and of It’s Too Late to Stop Now in particular, this article explores the location of the voice in terms of the body and of particular places and histories. It then proceeds to a reflection on the relationship between the performing voice as producer of sound, noise, and music and the poetic voice that provides the words and visions upon which the performing voice goes to work. It concludes by focusing on a moment within ‘Cyprus Avenue’ where Morrison performs the act of being tongue-tied, discussing this as an example of ‘aesthetic stutter’. Throughout, attention is also paid to how other voices (particularly those of rock critics) connect to Morrison’s voice by attempting to describe it, re-perform it, or explain it.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Words from the New World: Adventure and Memory in Patti Smith’s Late VoicePatti Smith: Outside (edited by Claude Chastagner),  2015Patti Smith’s late work is invariably connected by critics and fans to the work of her ‘classic’ ... more Patti Smith’s late work is invariably connected by critics and fans to the work of her ‘classic’ era (the 1970s punk scene) and the extent to which recent work lives up to, develops or exceeds that on which the artist’s reputation was based. Smith herself has been no stranger to such memory work, via her involvement in biographical projects such as her book Just Kids and the film Dream of Life. Her musical output since the 1990s has been characterized by memory work, not least in a number of pieces written in response to the passing of friends and family. Yet this work is complemented by an embrace of new beginnings and adventure, often achieved by returning to places, themes and styles Smith has explored before but looking for fresh angles and new perspectives. This essay explores the dynamic of adventure and memory via analysis of Smith’s 2012 album Banga, in which this dynamic is played out in informative ways. I focus on the music of Banga too, and on the different voices utilised by Smith. In the second part of the essay, I consider the canonisation of Smith and her work in light of what I term ‘late chronicles’, a series of documents and events over the past fifteen years that have seen Smith’s work fixed into the rock canon and have provided further context to situate her work and her many cultural reference points. I finish with some further observations on Banga, filtered through the knowledge we have of Smith from the late chronicles that preceded it.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It focuses specifically on the representation of innocence and experience via the "late voice". "Lateness", a concept exemplified by these artists but which extends to a broad range of modern (post mid-twentieth century) popular musics, refers to five primary issues: chronology (the stage in an artist's career); the vocal act (the ability to convincingly portray experience); afterlife (posthumous careers made possible by phonography); retrospection (how voices "look back" or anticipate looking back); and the writing of age, experience, lateness and loss into song texts. The main case study of the chapter is the song ‘Who Knows Where the Time Goes’, written by Denny and later performed by Collins and Simone. The song is analysed in terms of its representation of time and experience and in relation to the lives and works of its interpreters.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This article examines this “nostalgia gap” alongside the analogous gap found in representation. The relationship is highlighted via an analysis of “holiday records”, a genre of recordings that became prevalent in the 1960s. The genre intersects with the more familiar genres of exotica, mood music, easy listening and ambient, but is distinguished by its emphasis on a particular form of spatial reminiscence and imagination. Using the example of “April in Portugal”, a song that started life as a Portuguese fado and subsequently became an international hit and mood music staple, I address a set of questions that illustrate the nostalgia gap. What is being remembered or imagined in the song? Can we distinguish between described and prescribed nostalgia? How is saudade, the specifically Portuguese “grammar of nostalgia”, related to nostalgic languages found on other holiday records? Qu’elle se rapporte au temps ou à l’espace, la nostalgie naît d’un écart ou fossé entre le passé que l’on désire retrouver et le moment présent du désir. À travers cet article, je me propose d’examiner le « fossé nostalgique » et le fossé de représentation. La dynamique est explorée à travers une analyse des « disques de vacances », un genre d’enregistrements devenu très en vogue dans les années 1960. Le genre se situe à la croisée des genres plus connus de l’exotica, mood music, easy listening et ambient, mais s’en distingue par l’usage spécifique qu’il fait de réminiscences géographiques et de faits fictifs. En utilisant l’exemple d’ « April in Portugal », à l’origine un fado portugais qui est par la suite devenu un tube international et un grand classique de la mood music, je réponds à une série de questions qui illustrent le fossé nostalgique. Qu’est-ce qui est effectivement remémoré, qu’est-ce qui est imaginé dans la chanson ? Peut-on établir une différence entre nostalgie « descriptive », tirée d’une expérience vécue, et nostalgie « obligatoire », ou clichée ?

His lyrical and musical delivery, by turns absurdist, infantile, angry and melancholic, deconstructs everyday phrases and invites listeners to question the borders of sense and nonsense. This chapter examines connections between Wyatt’s work and a range of literary voices, particularly those associated with nursery rhyme, nonsense verse and absurdism. A further aim is to explore the role of sense and nonsense in popular music. If one of the ways in which music differs from literature is through its ability to communicate without words, can there be a relationship between sense and nonsense in musical language that correlates with that found in literature? In what ways can musical language be said to make or not make sense? Exposure to Wyatt’s work emphasises the extent to which, as a musician, he has made use of words and vocables, even as he has occasionally distanced himself from the importance of lyrics in his music. By focussing on the literary-textual nature of Wyatt’s work, the text highlights the different demands and expectations placed on the ‘popular’ and the ‘literary’.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This approach to Portugal’s ‘national music’ attracted consternation from fans of the genre due to the fact that, unlike flamenco and tango, fado does not have an associated dance form. For some commentators, Saura also took liberties by including a number of musicians from outside Portugal (including Spain, Africa and Latin America) and mixing traditional fado forms with other music genres (including rock, hip hop and Cape Verdean morna). Despite these potential distractions, Saura seems keen to depict the history of fado from its tangled roots to its present position as an urban folk music par excellence, a music that both evokes and inhabits the contemporary Portuguese city (in particular, the city of Lisbon). Through evocative use of light and shadow, Saura offers up a series of highly ‘photographic’ scenes in which fado’s poetics of urban haunting are made prominent. Therefore, rather than critiquing the director for his ‘inauthentic’ depiction of fado, I respond to Saura’s provocation by considering his film as a strategy for setting fado’s poetics of time, space and history in a new light. Taking a cue from the use of choreography and urban tableaux in the film, I offer a spatial reading of Fados that draws upon the work of Michel de Certeau and Henri Lefebvre. I argue that the film makes visible a ‘production of space’ that complements existing fado mythography.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The initial analysis develops into an exploration of the recorded ‘representations’ of Nina Simone’s performances, the gap between affect and representation, and the ways in which representations produce their own affects. It draws from theories of the evental, the transformative and the affective as outlined by Alain Badiou, J. L. Austin and Brian Massumi. It also makes reference to what Kathleen Stewart calls 'ordinary affects' in order to highlight the formative strategies of religious and/or ritualistic affect that can be found in Simone’s work. The first half is written from a series of fixed perspectives, while the second is crafted to reflect the themes under discussion, in particular the notions of folding, unfolding and refolding. Where scholarly analysis typically refolds the unfolding it has undertaken in order to present its findings as a coherent whole, something always already known, the purpose here is to leave part of the story unfolded as both provocation and exposition of the layers at work when analyzing affect.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

I am attempting to think about the ways that rock ’n’ roll functions as a musical revolution that becomes subjected to a narrative of loss accompanying the belief that the revolution has floundered, or even disappeared completely. In order to think about what this narrative of loss might entail I have found myself going back to the emergence of rock ’n’ roll, to what we might term its ‘event’, and then working towards the present to take stock of the current situation. The article is divided into three parts. Part One attempts to think of the emergence of rock ’n’ roll and its attendant discourse alongside Alain Badiou’s notion of event, looking at ways in which listening subjects are formed. Part Two continues the discussion of listening subjectivity while shifting the focus to objects associated with phonography. Part Three attends to a number of difficulties encountered in the Badiouian project and asks to what extent rock music might be thought of as a lost cause. All three parts deal with notions of subjectivity, love and fidelity.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It suggests that, while it is entirely possible to see the concert as an event whose "event-ness" is created post facto, it is also useful to posit the concert as part of a construction of a larger process, that of opposition to the "event" of authoritarianism. Discusses two songs, Víctor Jara's "Te recuerdo Amanda" and Rodríguez's "Unicornio", reflecting on their evocations of death and disappearance. Death, as evoked in the Jara song, at least bears the comfort of a tangible end image; disappearance, as "Unicornio" bears witness, denies closure. These recorded performances are further considered in the light of their afterlife as concert performances and the subjects of cover versions and tributes that all contribute to the counter-event suggested by the Rodríguez concert.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The project attempts to create a dialogue between theorists of loss and memory working in various disciplines and those working in and around popular music (musicians, critics, academics). It also recognises the vital role of loss in revolution (and vice versa) and attends to revolutionary moments, or events, not least the `event' of rock 'n' roll. It proceeds from the idea that, while creativity is a crucial aspect of the production and reception (or receptive production) of popular music, creativity often takes the form of a response, or set of responses, to loss. While rooted in popular music studies, the project reflects a desire to look outside the Anglophone tradition and includes case studies of a few music genres - Portuguese fado, Cuban nueva trova, Chilean nueva canciön - that exist in a place between popular music studies and ethnomusicology. It also studies three areas more familiar to Anglophone popular music studies: rock 'n' roll, black protest music in America and punk/post-punk in Britain. Methodologically, the thesis draws on popular music studies, philosophy and cultural theory in an attempt to suggest ways that these disciplines can inform each other.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
A Blank Space Where You Write Your Name: Taylor Swift's Early Late VoiceTaylor Swift’s songs invite listeners to connect art and life in the tradition, if not always the... more Taylor Swift’s songs invite listeners to connect art and life in the tradition, if not always the style, of the ‘confessional’ singer-songwriter. From an early age, Swift has written and sung about ‘big topics’ like time and experience with a remarkable sense of self awareness. Her songs hymn youthful experience to great effect through references to specific ages or via more general depictions of girlishness, school, first loves, summer vacations and family. Through her lyrical preoccupations, Swift exemplifies many aspects of what I call ‘late voice’, a way of thinking about the writing and singing of time, age and experience. My conceptualisation of lateness considers artists and listeners not only in terms of conventional ‘late’ periods (i.e. old age), but as subjects who reflect on such issues throughout our lives. In the first part of this paper, I make the case for Swift as an exponent of ‘early late voice’.While a number of commentators have picked up on the maturity of Swift’s writing voice, comparatively little attention has been paid to her singing. I address this gap by looking at the conflation of writing/singing in the singer-songwriter’s voice. I examine tensions that have been noted between Swift’s art and her star persona. To what extent, I ask, is the denigration of Swift’s musical style (her singing as much as her move towards chart pop) a gendered attack on young women’s voices? At the same time, what strategies have been used to authenticate Swift as an artist by other critics? I conclude with a discussion of Ryan Adams’s cover of Swift’s 1989 album and the critical discourse surrounding it, arguing that the ‘blank space’ of Swift’s voice becomes legitimated and appropriated by a critical discourse focussed on roots, genre and masculinity.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Her work—always suffused with longing, sensuality and the passion of being—took on, in her later career, what might be termed a ‘defiant melancholy’ as she used her songs and live performances to navigate the burden of her past. As much as she had been a movement intellectual in the 1960s, Simone had been a star and the sense of loss of both political possibility (signalled by the ‘failure’ of the civil rights movement in the USA) and stardom (signalled by the decline in her popularity) flavoured much of the material she produced from the mid-1970s onwards.In this paper, I explore Simone’s extraordinary performance at the 1976 Montreux Jazz Festival, and in particular her rendition of Janis Ian’s song ‘Stars’. I begin by reflecting on Ian’s own experience of celebrity and the way she articulated it in ‘Stars’, then I move on to compare Simone’s version, analysing it in the context of the festival appearance in which it appeared and in the longer text of Simone’s life as an artist and celebrity. Drawing on scholarship connected to celebrity, authorship and liveness, I read the song as exemplifying and challenging narratives of fame and artistic biography. I also reflect on cover versions as modes of authorship, authentication and experience and as live performance as an interface for stars and their audiences.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Telling this story chronologically will encourage a focus on the twists, turns and mutations that occur during the life of a much-performed song, tracing in particular the way in which this song’s inherent representational distance grows into ever more distanced , displaced and distorted configurations. This journey will travel from Portugal to Brazil, from France to the USA, as well as many points in between. The second part of the paper reverses this historical chronology by focusing on the chronology of the research process, on the unearthing, excavation and genealogic processes involved in historical song studies. What can be understood from having all of these ‘Coimbras’ available to us, not least on digital platforms such as Spotify, YouTube and iTunes? Here, notions of the archive, of media archaeology and of the material life of music become paramount and impact on the questions of nostalgia and temporal displacement with which this panel is engaged.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It seeks to highlight the ways in which recording adds lateness, or posthumousness, to musical creation. Edison originally conceived the phonograph as primarily a memorial device and this aspect is still crucial to understanding sound reproduction. As a way of making concrete such philosophical concerns and of connecting to the broader project reflected in this panel, I first consider the uses to which song collectors put recording technology during both fieldwork and in early studio recording sessions in the UK and USA. I follow this with a consideration of how, with the growth of the record industry and the spread of recordings as the primary means by which many people came to know and understand vernacular music, the notion of collecting shifted from one in which human beings were sought out for their songs to one in which recordings themselves were prized. The paper engages briefly with debates around phonography, the archive and memory work, as well as making reference to figures involved in song and record collecting, such as the Lomaxes, Moses Asch, Harry Smith and Joe Bussard. In terms of lateness, the focus here is on the extent to which recordings and the voices contained within them are seen or heard as living or dead. As objects, recorded artefacts enable voices to live on and artists to ‘enjoy’ posthumous careers. But of equal interest are the ‘lives’ of the objects themselves, which maintain a strange hold over consumers, demanding that we not abandon them, or that we at least mourn their passing. Records gave voices an afterlife and people, in turn, give records an afterlife.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It focuses on Simone's reaction to what she saw as the failure of the civil rights movement and how that reaction was played out in her work from the end of the 1960s onwards, blending into a personal but still critical nostalgia in her late work. The talk also makes reference to the recent commemoration of Martin Luther King's 'I Have a Dream' speech and Nina Simone's response to King's murder. It also acts as a commemoration of Simone and her legacy, with 2013 marking 80 years since her birth and 10 since her death.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Listening to Europe: Continental Records in BritainThis paper examines the circulation of recordings from continental Europe in Britain prior to the... more This paper examines the circulation of recordings from continental Europe in Britain prior to the Second World War, focussing on the broadcast and critical reception of recordings as found in journals such as The Gramophone. I suggest that the discourse built around "foreign" musics during this period can be seen as a forerunner of later periods of interest in international recordings, such as the Anglophone fascination with "exotica" during the 1950s/60s, the "world music" boom of the 1980s and the more recent obsession with "vinyl archaeology". While these later periods highlight greater consumer access to foreign sounds (through tourism, world music media and access to studio technology), the pre-War period is notable for the reliance on paternalistic "experts" to mediate the sound of otherness to a relatively small and privileged audience. The period thus forms a link between what can be broadly thought of as a colonial era and an era of globalization. I analyse the desire to listen beyond the boundaries of everyday audition, the dependence on imagination and memory and desire in this process, and recordings as exemplary instantiations of the making-audible of such desires.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
‘Across the Evening Sky’: Real and Anticipated Experience in Nina Simone’s Late VoicePopular music artists, as performers in the public eye, offer a privileged site for the witnessin... more Popular music artists, as performers in the public eye, offer a privileged site for the witnessing and analysis of ageing and its mediation. Musical analysis allows us to posit the concept of "sounded experience", a term intended to describe how music reflects upon and helps to mediate life experience over extended periods of time (indeed, over lifetimes). Connected to this is the supposition that phonography, understood as the after-effects of the revolution in experience initiated by the advent of sound recording, provides a rich site for exploring issues of memory, time, lateness and afterlife.This paper discusses these issues via an analysis of the work of Nina Simone, an artist whose mid-late career offers valuable insights into the interplay of history, biography and memory. The paper will focus specifically on the representation of innocence and experience via what I term the "late voice". "Lateness", a concept exemplified by Simone's work but which extends to a broad range of modern (post mid-twentieth century) popular musics, refers to five primary issues: chronology (the stage in an artist's career); the vocal act (the ability to convincingly portray experience); afterlife (posthumous careers made possible by phonography); retrospection (how voices "look back" or anticipate looking back); and the writing of age, experience, lateness and loss into song texts.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Wyatt is both an innovative songwriter and a keen interpreter of the works of other singer-songwriters. This paper will analyse songs from both parts of Wyatt’s repertoire to connect three of the core conference themes: the interaction of words and sound, geographies of the singer-songwriter and politics and protest. It will first explore the unique world of Wyatt’s songwriting, one that shows a linguistic and sonic fascination with nonsense and the absurd, often articulated via recourse to a childlike sense of wonder at the world and a desire to cling to domestic comforts. It will then contrast this with Wyatt’s more explicitly political work, which reflects his engagement with left wing politics and with an ever-increasing geo-political outlook. This political work takes the form of both self-written material and cover versions of work by international singer-songwriters, a process which contributes to a global network of committed music. The paper will conclude by considering ways in which innocence and experience, and personal and political themes complement each other in Wyatt’s work.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

His lyrical and musical delivery, by turns absurdist, infantile, angry and melancholic, deconstructs everyday phrases and invites listeners to question the borders of sense and nonsense. This paper will gather a few of these stylistic experiments under the title of “literary voices” by highlighting examples of Wyatt’s use of nursery rhyme, nonsense verse, absurdism, and wordlessness. Brief exposure to three case studies will emphasize the extent to which Wyatt as a musician has made use of words and vocables, even as he has occasionally distanced himself from the importance of lyrics in his music. Furthermore, by focussing on the literary-textual nature of Wyatt’s work, light can hopefully be shed on the ways in which we differentiate popular music from literature. What are the different demands and expectations placed on the “popular” and the “literary”?Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Songs of Fate: Marceneiro's Drooping Cadences, Morrissey's Avenging MiseryThis joint paper discusses issues of fate, inevitability, tragedy and freedom in relationship to ... more This joint paper discusses issues of fate, inevitability, tragedy and freedom in relationship to two distinct musical worlds: Portuguese fado as exemplified in the figures of Alfredo Marceneiro, Amália Rodrigues and Mariza; and 'anti-camp' British pop as embodied by the work of Morrissey. Fate seems to be about the inevitable in a relatively uncomplicated manner. But it has a more ambiguous relationship with the predictable. On the one hand, fate acts as an alternative to prediction - what will be will be, we can't know what it will be. But in saying this we are already predicting. When we make claims on music regarding its predictability, what type of prediction are we speaking of? Something we can know because we know what has gone before and see the template that this music is following? Something that is fated? Inevitable? What interventions can be made? Why would we want to make them? Convention may guide us to expect but we don't know quite what to expect. This "quite what" - a small and subtle detail of difference, an intervention - matters a great deal. Convention and intervention can be seen as a constant teasing between delivery and non-delivery. Like haiku or comedy, popular song transforms the tease of convention and intervention to an art form. Another way to think of fate in relation to fado is to consider it as a self-resignation. Resigning oneself may not only be a passive, predetermined acceptance of the inevitable; it may also be the result of the exhaustion brought about by an impossible fight. This is self-resignation in the face of an intransigence of the other. After all the battles to make oneself heard, to alter the course of events, to even find a place in a desired community, the intransigent other, backed by the might of establishment, performs a ceaseless wearing down of the subject. To what extent are the 'drooping cadences' of fado and the 'avenging misery' of Morrissey a response to such situations?Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

I concentrate on the so-called ‘new fado’ which emerged in the 1990s and gained considerable popularity both domestically and internationally, acting as a cultural product for reaffirming local identity via recourse to social memory and an imagined community while also providing a distinctive cultural export for the dissemination of a ‘remembered Portugal’ on the global stage. In reflecting on the mediation of fado’s ‘memory community’, I will focus on the role of transference in fado songs. Crucial to my thinking here will be a theorising of witnessing whereby I set out the connections between the desire to remember and the imperative to testify to what one has remembered. Witnessing is here thought of as a kind of carrying and I pursue the implications for such a carrying on the writing, memorisation and voicing of song texts. The theory presented is one that has resonance beyond fado music, yet fado provides an exemplary case study given the number of song texts in the genre that focus on notions of carrying and unburdening. Bearing witness and bearing up are crucial themes in fado lyrics, while fado performance style places special emphasis on the carrying-on of tradition and the carrying-out of cathartic tasks. Keywords: Portugal, fado, memory, witnessing, testimonialSave to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The first strand relates to the world expressed in fado song texts, in particular the centrality of the city of Lisbon. Fado, through the combination of word, music and gesture that has become solidified as the music’s ‘style’, performs place in a very particular way, summoning up a mythology that attempts to trace the remembered and imagined city of the past via a poetics of haunting. At the same time certain locales of the physical city present themselves as exhibits in a ‘museum of song’, offering up haunted melodies of a Portuguese sonic past that serves to assert the city’s identity. My research in this area uses literary sources such as Fernando Pessoa and Italo Calvino to compare accounts of the city as both historically specific and ‘timeless’. The second strand of my research relates to contemporary fado recordings and performances, especially those of the so-called “new fadistas”, whose popularity over the past decade has brought fado to a high level of visibility internationally. Fado performers have found themselves at the forefront of a star system promoted by the contemporary world music network. This presentation of fado as ‘world music’ has led to notable developments in live and recorded performance, where a balance is sought between the presentation of fado’s specificity as a music associated with Portugal and the felt necessity for a technologically-enhanced ‘universal’ acoustic world. This strand of my work intersects with the other by asking what is gained and lost through this process in terms of fado’s locality.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

One of the main lyrical themes of fado is the city itself, particularly those areas most associated with the music’s origins such as Mouraria, Alfama and Bairro Alto. A mythology of place is summoned up in fado song texts that attempts to trace the remembered and imagined city of the past via a poetics of haunting. At the same time certain locales of the physical city present themselves as stages in a kind of museum of song, offering up haunted melodies of a Portuguese sonic past that serves to assert the city’s identity. City and song, then, bear witness to each other. In this paper I will examine a few of the ways that this witnessing ‘takes place’ by drawing on the work of Roland Barthes, Sylviane Agacinski and M. Christine Boyer amongst others. I will use the song ‘Vielas de Alfama’ (‘Alleyways of Alfama’) as an example of the historicisation of Lisbon and will refer to other city-related fado songs as part of my discussion. Throughout my interest remains with the ways we can read the city and its songs as texts within texts.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

While analysing Simone's extensive repertoire, I found myself thinking increasingly about issues of innocence and experience in modern (mid-late twentieth century) popular song and the use by singers and songwriters of what I call a 'late voice'. The lateness I refer to relates to a number of issues: chronology (the stage in an artist's career), the vocal act (the ability to convincingly portray innocence or experience at whatever stage in a career), afterlife (an artist's posthumous career made possible by recordings and cover versions), retrospection (how do voices 'look back' or, even more strangely, anticipate looking back?) and, more generally, the writing of songs. This is work I intend to pursue at length in a future research project.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Yet such an easy definition, however accurate, may prevent us from seeing fado as a music that has tended to be disdained by ethnomusicologists for being too commercial and neglected by popular music scholars for being too folkloric: in short fado has become, like so many musics in this situation, that liminal entity known as world music. The rise in global popularity of the so-called “new fadistas” over the last decade has led fado to a level of visibility unmatched since the heyday of the internationally-renowned fadista Amália Rodrigues. Current fado performers, in particular Mariza, have found themselves at the forefront of a star system promoted by the culture industry that is the contemporary world music network. In between these moments of visibility, meanwhile, and no doubt preceding and succeeding them, fado continues as a local popular practice. Drawing on research into the historiography of fado and on cultural theoretical perspectives on contemporary fado performance, this paper will examine the relationships between fado as a local practice and a global phenomenon. By looking at the mediation between the local and the global it will examine how myth-making and the figure of the “star fadista” provide both the conditions of possibility for effective transmission of fado and a narrative that informs both local knowledge and media promotion of the music in equal measure.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Often described as a form of homesickness, nostalgia is, by definition, the feeling that makes us wish to repossess or reoccupy a space. Such spaces appear to us as both near and distant, tangible and remote, and it seems that attempts at reclaiming them are frequently musical in nature. We know, for instance, that particular compositions have played important roles in helping people to navigate or mitigate a sense of displacement. In these circumstances, affective experiences may be bound up with trauma or joy, as is the case of song during wartime or musical imaginaries among migrants. Under other conditions, we might identify a ‘second-hand nostalgia’ in the guise of a musically-inflected tourism that seeks to reactivate (for pleasure and/or profit) the historical aura of an urban site. What are we to make of the abundance of personal, inter-personal, and propositional episodes that posit music as some kind of a bridge to the urban past?Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Her work—always suffused with longing, sensuality and the passion of being—took on, in her later career, what might be termed a &#39;defiant melancholy&#39; as she used her songs and live performances to navigate the burden of her past. As much as she had been a movement intellectual in the 1960s, Simone had been a star and the sense of loss of both political possibility (signalled by the &#39;failure&#39; of the civil rights movement in the USA) and stardom (signalled by the decline in her popularity) flavoured much of the material she produced from the mid-1970s onwards.

In the case of British musician Robert Wyatt, both writing style and vocal instrument are utterly distinctive and this combined ‘voice’ has served to mediate, and occasionally muddy, the already playful relationship between words and music in Wyatt’s work. Much of his own songwriting, with its predilections for nonsense and the absurd, is articulated via a childlike sense of wonder at the world and a desire to cling to domestic comforts. This is supplemented by a more explicitly political body of work, reflecting Wyatt’s engagement with left wing politics and an ever-increasing geo-political outlook. This political work takes the form of both self-written material and cover versions of work by international singer-songwriters, a process which contributes to a global network of committed music.

By emphasising sonic factors, Elliott makes new and fascinating connections between a wide range of artistic examples to ultimately build a case for the importance of sound in creating, maintaining and disrupting meaningSave to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

‘Across the evening sky’: the late voices of Sandy Denny, Judy Collins and Nina SimoneThis chapter explores the work of three female musicians – Sandy Denny, Judy Collins and Nina Sim... more This chapter explores the work of three female musicians – Sandy Denny, Judy Collins and Nina Simone – whose work offers valuable insights into the interplay of history, biography and memory. It focuses specifically on the representation of innocence and experience via the &quot;late voice&quot;. &quot;Lateness&quot;, a concept exemplified by these artists but which extends to a broad range of modern (post mid-twentieth century) popular musics, refers to five primary issues: chronology (the stage in an artist&#39;s career); the vocal act (the ability to convincingly portray experience); afterlife (posthumous careers made possible by phonography); retrospection (how voices &quot;look back&quot; or anticipate looking back); and the writing of age, experience, lateness and loss into song texts. The main case study of the chapter is the song ‘Who Knows Where the Time Goes’, written by Denny and later performed by Collins and Simone. The song is analysed in terms of its representation of...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
‘Won’t You Spare Me Over till Another Year?’: Ralph Stanley’s Late VoiceThe Late Voice,  2015This chapter (from The Late Voice: Time, Age and Experience in Popular Music) focuses, for the mo... more This chapter (from The Late Voice: Time, Age and Experience in Popular Music) focuses, for the most part, on Ralph Stanley (1927-2016), the bluegrass or ‘old-time’ musician whose long career in popular music gained fresh recognition following the use of his music in the film O Brother, Where Art Thou? in 2000. Taking as a starting point the song ‘O Death’, the chapter examines discourse around Stanley’s age and the ways in which age is witnessed in his voice. I provide an overview of Stanley’s career, followed by a discussion of different versions of ‘O Death’. I also consider the relationship between the particular and the universal and between the individual and the community.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
A Dream Deferred: Nina Simone and the Work of MourningThis talk presents work from Richard Elliott&#39;s recent book about the late singer, songwriter,... more This talk presents work from Richard Elliott&#39;s recent book about the late singer, songwriter, pianist and civil rights activist Nina Simone. It focuses on Simone&#39;s reaction to what she saw as the failure of the civil rights movement and how that reaction was played out in her work from the end of the 1960s onwards, blending into a personal but still critical nostalgia in her late work. The talk also makes reference to the recent commemoration of Martin Luther King&#39;s &#39;I Have a Dream&#39; speech and Nina Simone&#39;s response to King&#39;s murder. It also acts as a commemoration of Simone and her legacy, with 2013 marking 80 years since her birth and 10 since her death.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Tudo Isto Ainda É Fado? Fado as Local and Global PracticeFado and the Place of Longing,  2017&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;... more &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;Fado has been regularly classed alongside other musics such as rembetika, tango and flamenco as a kind of urban folk music with strong connections to an underclass. Yet such an easy definition, however accurate, may prevent us from seeing fado as a music that has tended to be disdained by ethnomusicologists for being too commercial and neglected by popular music scholars for being too folkloric: in short fado has become, like so many musics in this situation, that liminal entity known as world music. The rise in global popularity of the so-called “new fadistas” over the last decade has led fado to a level of visibility unmatched since the heyday of the internationally-renowned fadista Amália Rodrigues. Current fado performers, in particular Mariza, have found themselves at the forefront of a star system promoted by the culture industry that is the contemporary world music network. In between these moments of visibility, meanwhile, and no doubt preceding and succeeding them, fado continues as a local popular practice. Drawing on research into the historiography of fado and on cultural theoretical perspectives on contemporary fado performance, this paper will examine the relationships between fado as a local practice and a global phenomenon. By looking at the mediation between the local and the global it will examine how myth-making and the figure of the “star fadista” provide both the conditions of possibility for effective transmission of fado and a narrative that informs both local knowledge and media promotion of the music in equal measure. &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
