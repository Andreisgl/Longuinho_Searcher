I would like to announce the release of MediaWiki 1.24.2, 1.23.9 and
1.19.24. These releases fix 10 security issues, in addition to other bug
fixes. Download links are given at the end of this email.
== Security fixes ==
* iSEC Partners discovered a way to circumvent the SVG MIME blacklist for
embedded resources (iSEC-WMF1214-11). This allowed an attacker to embed
JavaScript in the SVG. The issue was additionally identified by Mario
Heiderich / Cure53. MIME types are now whitelisted.
<https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T85850>
* MediaWiki user Bawolff pointed out that the SVG filter to prevent
injecting JavaScript using animate elements was incorrect.
<https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T86711>
* MediaWiki user Bawolff reported a stored XSS vulnerability due to the way
attributes were expanded in MediaWiki's Html class, in combination with
LanguageConverter substitutions.
<https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T73394>
* Internal review discovered that MediaWiki's SVG filtering could be
bypassed with entity encoding under the Zend interpreter. This could be
used to inject JavaScript. This issue was also discovered by Mario Gomes
from Beyond Security.
<https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T88310>
* iSEC Partners discovered a XSS vulnerability in the way api errors were
reflected when running under HHVM versions before 3.6.1 (iSEC-WMF1214-8).
MediaWiki now detects and mitigates this issue on older versions of HHVM.
<https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T85851>
* Internal review and iSEC Partners discovered (iSEC-WMF1214-1) that
MediaWiki versions using PBKDF2 for password hashing (the default since
1.24) are vulnerable to DoS attacks using extremely long passwords.
<https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T64685>
* iSEC Partners discovered that MediaWiki's SVG and XMP parsing, running
under HHVM, was susceptible to "Billion Laughs" DoS attacks
(iSEC-WMF1214-13).
<https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T85848>
* Internal review found that MediaWiki is vulnerable to "Quadratic Blowup"
DoS attacks, under both HHVM and Zend PHP.
<https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T71210>
* iSEC Partners discovered a way to bypass the style filtering for SVG
files (iSEC-WMF1214-3). This could violate the anonymity of users viewing
the SVG.
<https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T85349>
* iSEC Partners reported that the MediaWiki feature allowing a user to
preview another user's custom JavaScript could be abused for privilege
escalation (iSEC-WMF1214-10). This feature has been removed.
<https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T85855>
Additionally, the following extensions have been updated to fix security
issues:
* Extension:Scribunto - MediaWiki user Jackmcbarn discovered that function
names were not sanitized in Lua error backtraces, which could lead to XSS.
<https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T85113>
* Extension:CheckUser - iSEC Partners discovered that the CheckUser
extension did not prevent CSRF attacks on the form allowing checkusers to
look up sensitive information about other users (iSEC-WMF1214-6). Since the
use of CheckUser is logged, the CSRF could be abused to defame a trusted
user or flood the logs with noise.
<https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T85858>
== Bug fixes ==
=== 1.24 ===
* Fix case of SpecialAllPages/SpecialAllMessages in SpecialPageFactory to
fix loading these special pages when $wgAutoloadAttemptLowercase is false.
* (bug T76254) Fix deleting of pages with PostgreSQL. Requires a schema
change and running update.php to fix.
== 1.23 & 1.24 ==
* (bug T70087) Fix Special:ActiveUsers page for installations using
PostgreSQL.
