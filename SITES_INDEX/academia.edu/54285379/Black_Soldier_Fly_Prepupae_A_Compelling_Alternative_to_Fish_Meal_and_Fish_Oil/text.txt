Live prepupae are 44% dm and are easily dried for long term storage. As a component of a complete diet they have been found to support good growth of chicks , swine , rainbow trout ) and catfish . Peer reviewed studies show that prepupae meal can replace at least 25% of the fish meal in a diet with no reduction in gain or feed conversion ratio (FCR) in rainbow trout or channel catfish . Separation of the prepupae fat and protein would allow for formulation of more balanced diets and produce a meal with over 60% protein.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersThe Israeli journal of aquaculture = BamidgehA Model for Substitution of Fishmeal with Maggot-Meal in Tilapia Feeds -A Commercial Production Farm in West AfricaKim JaunceyIntensive tilapia production (Oreochromis niloticus) is an emerging industry in West Africa. Access and availability of economically viable formulated commercial fish feeds are major constraints. The availability and cost of animal source ingredients such as fishmeal (FM), typically used in limited amounts to ensure balanced diets and high performance, is a global issue. Research has been conducted to identify and utilize locally produced, cost-efficient feedstuffs to partially or completely replace FM with a focus on plant and animal by-products. Interest in insect-derived meals, particularly fly larvae (Musca domestica, Hermetia illucens, etc.) as potential replacements for FM in aquaculture diets has increased. Commercial quantities of insect larvae, maggot meal, (MM) can be produced under tropical conditions due to their high rates of reproduction, growth, and their ability to grow on a large variety of organic substrates.

Abdel-MoneimInsects could be a potential replacement of protein-rich ingredients in poultry diets. Among these insects, black soldier fly (BSF), Hermetia illucens, has a high content of protein and fat, which reinforces the potential of using it in poultry feed formulation and makes it one of the most promising insect species for commercial production. Protein content as well as amino acid profile in H. illucens larvae is comparable to those in many protein-rich feedstuffs such as fish meal and soybean meal. BSF can convert organic wastes into a precious source of nutrients, such as proteins, lipids, and chitin, which contribute to reducing the environmental burden and pollution potential arising from organic waste accumulation. This review emphasizes the significance of this insect as a “green” technology in the extremely variable recycling of organic waste and generates a sustainable protein source as well as the importance of its use as a substitute of protein-rich feedstuff in poultry feed ...Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of the World Aquaculture SocietyFish Offal Recycling by the Black Soldier Fly Produces a Foodstuff High in Omega-3 Fatty Acids2007 • Mark McGuireDownload Free PDFView PDFReview of Black Soldier Fly (Hermetia illucens) as Animal Feed and Human FoodMatan ShelomiFood futurists accept that sustainability-minded humanity will increasingly incorporate insects as alternative protein. The most studied and easily reared species are not necessarily the most sustainable, acceptable, or delicious. Here, we review the literature on the black soldier fly, Hermetia illucens, which is capable of efficiently converting a wide variety of organic materials, from food waste to manure, into insect biomass. They can be grown and harvested without dedicated facilities and are not pestiferous. Their larvae are 42% crude protein and 29% fat, although they are higher in saturated fats than most insects. They do not concentrate pesticides or mycotoxins. They are already grown and recommended for use as animal feed, but with regional legal restrictions on how this is done. For commercial use in human foods, larvae could potentially be milled and converted into a textured protein with a strong flavor. Their biggest advantage over other insects is their ability to convert waste into food, generating value and closing nutrient loops as they reduce pollution and costs. This general advantage is also their greatest disadvantage, for the social stigmas and legal prohibitions against eating organisms that eat waste are added to extant taboos facing insect consumption.Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of Insects as Food and FeedNutritional value of the black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens L.) and its suitability as animal feed – a reviewkarol fonsecaThe black soldier fly (BSF; Hermetia illucens L.; Diptera: Stratiomyidae) has been studied for its capability to convert organic waste to high quality protein, control certain harmful bacteria and insect pests, provide potential chemical precursors to produce biodiesel and for its use as feed for a variety of animals. Nutritional value of BSF larvae is discussed, as well as the effect of biotic and abiotic factors on both larval body composition and performance. Although BSF larvae contain high protein levels (from 37 to 63% dry matter; DM), and other macro- and micronutrients important for animal feed, the available studies on including BSF larvae in feed rations for poultry, pigs and fish suggest that it could only partially replace traditional feedstuff, because high or complete replacement resulted in reduced performance. This is due to factors such as high fat content (from 7 to 39% DM), ash (from 9 to 28% DM), and consequences of processing. Therefore, further studies are need...Download Free PDFView PDFUsing the Black Soldier Fly, Hermetia Illucens, as a Value-Added Tool for the Management of Swine ManureGary BurtleDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
