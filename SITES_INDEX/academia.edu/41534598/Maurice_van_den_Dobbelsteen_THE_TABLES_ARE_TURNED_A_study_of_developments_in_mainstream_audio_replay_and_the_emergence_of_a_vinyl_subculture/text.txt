In this thesis I have described and analyzed a historical overview of major developments that have shaped audio (and video) replay. I compared the values these developments hold for the parties involved between mainstream audio (and video) replay and vinyl replay. To this end I developed a methodology called the Value System. The result is an organized insight into a complex situation of agency and structure, over time, across formats. It’s main conclusion then was that, when a necessity has moved to the digital domain and becomes a commodity there, this will provide room for the previous analogue process to be enjoyed in limited form as a classical experience, or, premium experience.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersJournal of Popular Music StudiesSTEVE JONES AND MARTIN SORGER: COVERING MUSIC: A BRIEF HISTORY AND ANALYSIS OF ALBUM COVER DESIGN1999 • Steve JonesDownload Free PDFView PDFThe Complete Idiot's Guide to Creating Cds and Dvds2003 • Rob BoirunDownload Free PDFView PDFHertfordshire Law JournalFile Sharers: Criminals, Civil Wrongdoers or the Saviours of the Entertainment Industry? A Research Study into Behaviour, Motivational Rationale and Legal Perception Relating to Cyber Piracy2007 • Michael FilbyThe ongoing battle between file sharers and the entertainment industries is one which has been largely approached from the point of view of the latter parties with the reasoning that the law should be invoked to clamp down on the distribution of unauthorised copies of works through peer to peer networks. This paper argues that the industries, with the assistance of the legislature in certain circumstances, should be focussing their attentions not on limiting the natural evolution being brought about in the digital age, but by recognising that many of the parties labelled as scurrilous pirates are actually a rich market which can be tapped into through alternative means. An analysis of various theories relating to the routes, impacts and effects of file sharing is applied to a digital distribution model. The model is then expanded to encompass the Efficient Distribution Theory which argues that, through the application of measures which can be cheaply and easily implemented by the entertainment industries, a number of factors can mitigate any negative effects file sharing may cause to the extent that widely distributing digital copies can be directly beneficial to the industries. The analysis and theory is supported by the results of a research study carried out by the author in February 2007, which are presented in this paper. The findings of the research indicate that those who engage in cyber piracy not only financially spend more on authorised products proliferated by the entertainment industries compared to those who do not engage in piracy, but are also willing to move away from committing tortious acts of copyright infringement if the industries can provide a viable alternative means of digital delivery, inter alia.Download Free PDFView PDFDesign and Culture,, vol. 1, no. 1 (2009), pp. 79-92.The Music CD and its EndsWilliam StrawDownload Free PDFView PDFProceedings from PICMET '11: Technology Management in the Energy-Smart WorldThe Adoption of New, More Efficient Technologies and Consumer Behavior: The Case of Home Video Entertainment in Mexico2011 • Humberto MerrittIn recent years, there has been a growing pressure on consumers to adopt energy-efficient electronic devices as a way to reduce CO2 emissions. Although Blu-ray high definition disc players (BD) are viewed as better electronic devices than the standard DVD players, they have not yet massively pervaded. That is because the penetration of this new, more efficient technology is determined by factors such as the cost-benefit of BD players as well as the advantages consumers still attribute to the incumbent technology. This paper analyzes the barriers that consumers face to adopt the newer DVD technology in the case of Mexico. Drawing on a survey on Mexican users of DVD technology, it was possible to identify the main factors that deter users from buying BD players. According to the empirical analysis, the chief deterrents are the higher price of Blu-ray combos (players and discs), the lack of information regarding this technology, and, quite surprisingly, the confidence users said to have with the former technology. These results might suggest that Mexico's demand for standard DVDs will continue unabated in years to come in spite of the better quality attributes and energy-efficient features of the Blu-ray technology.Download Free PDFView PDFCreeping decay: cult soundtracks, residual media, and digital technologiesJamie SextonThis paper explores the recent resurgence in the collecting of cult film soundtracks, in particular films stemming from the late 1960s to the early 1980s and often linked to horror and other modes of exploitation cinema. I consider this phenomenon as an important component of cult film fandom, but one which has largely been overlooked in cult cinema research because it is often considered as belonging to popular music, as opposed to film, research. As films can become cultified in many different ways and across different media, I look into how areas of music culture can both be inspired by, as well as influence, aspects of film culture. The paper also addresses the importance of ‘residual’ technologies within cult film/music cultures, noting in particular the preference for vinyl records as well as VHS tapes in certain cult fan communities, and explores the appeal that such ‘old media’ retain within an increasingly digital mediascape.Download Free PDFView PDFDigitization Effects on Media Production and Consumptionshamal nerwayDownload Free PDFView PDFThe Cambridge Companion to Pop and Rock, Frith, Simon, Straw, Will, and Street, John (eds.).
