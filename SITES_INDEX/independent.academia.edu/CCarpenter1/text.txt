PapersHelping Students Repack for Remotivation and Agencyby Tim Murphey and Christopher CarpenterThis exploratory study invited 285 Japanese university students studying English as a foreign lan... more This exploratory study invited 285 Japanese university students studying English as a foreign language (EFL) to reflect on what demotivated and remotivated them. Students charted the ups and downs of their English learning histories and then completed a questionnaire in which they explained the causes of their demotivation and the pathways, unintentional or intentional, by which they became remotivated. This data was analyzed in terms of the affective and attitudinal conditions which students brought with them into the classroom. Studentswith positive antecedent conditions were found to have experienced fewer periods of demotivation in the past and exhibited more dynamic use of a wide range of strategies in their attempts to remotivate themselves. There is evidence to suggest that these learners also had more exposure to such strategies in use. Based on this hypothesis, we compiled and returned the strategies they reported to seed their self-motivational practices.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
