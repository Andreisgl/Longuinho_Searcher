World Reputation Rankings 2022The Times Higher Education World Reputation Rankings 2022 are based on the world’s largest invitation-only opinion survey of senior, published academics. It asks scholars to name no more than 15 universities that they believe are the best for research and teaching in their field.

Harvard University tops the ranking for the 12th consecutive year, and the US remains the most represented country, with 56 institutions (one fewer than last year).
The top 10 is dominated by the US and UK, with the only exceptions being China’s Tsinghua University, rising one place to ninth, and Japan’s University of Tokyo, rising three spots to 10th.
China and Japan continue their success elsewhere in the rankings – China built on the progress it made in previous years, and Japan bounced back from a poorer performance last year.
Nine Chinese universities have improved their reputation, while four declined in the rankings and four retained their position. Tsinghua University rose one place to ninth; Peking University climbed two to 13th; and Shanghai Jiao Tong University leapt up 22 places to 28th. Fudan University, Sichuan University, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS), Harbin Institute of Technology, Sun Yat-sen University and Southeast University also improved.
Like last year, the UK still has the second highest number of representatives in the ranking, but at 24, one fewer than last year. Its highest entry is the University of Oxford, in fourth place.
Overall, universities in 32 countries are included in the ranking.
