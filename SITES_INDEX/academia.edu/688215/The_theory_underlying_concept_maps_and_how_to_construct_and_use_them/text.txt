The study explores student’s skill of grouping concepts and creating a concept map. The sample for the study consisted of 131 grade 11 secondary school students from all over Estonia. A test comprising 2 problems was compiled to investigate the grouping of alcohol related concept and creating a concept map. Findings from the study, showed that students mostly make subject related groups and they don’t see relationships between different types of terms. To create a concept map students added mostly social and value related terms, students avoids subject related terms If students have a possibility to avoid social factors, then they don’t use them. Only students who have good problem solving skill (good STL skill), can associate subject content to social factors and also show how different subject content were related.Download Free PDFView PDFWhat are My Students Learning when they Concept Map2018 • Alberto J CañasConcept maps are used by educators all over the world as a learning tool. In addition to help learn subject-matter content, concept mapping is considered to develop higher-order thinking skills. However, concept mapping is used most commonly as an assessment tool, and set within an activity that usually does not involve learning. Depending on how instructors use concept mapping with their students, they can facilitate increased learning of both subject-matter content and higher-order thinking skills, or it can be an activity with little impact in the students’ learning. In this paper we discuss under what conditions concept mapping can lead to learning, and what it takes for the students to get there.Download Free PDFView PDFThe Theory Underlying Concept Maps and How To Construct ThemAlberto J CañasDownload Free PDFView PDFSchool Science and MathematicsThe Concept Map as an Aid to Instruction in Science and Mathematics1984 • John MaloneDownload Free PDFView PDFCommunications of The AisCONCEPT MAPS FOR TEACHING AND ASSESSMENT2003 • Andrew  UrbaczewskiDownload Free PDFView PDFThe Australian mathematics teacherUsing concept maps to show ' connections ' in measurement: An example from the Australian Curriculum2014 • Margaret MarshmanThe Australian Curriculum: Mathematics ensures that the links between the various components of mathematics ... are made clear (Rationale ACARA, 2012).Download Free PDFView PDFALT-JA theoretical view on concept mapping1994 • Ray McAleeseDownload Free PDFView PDFEffectiveness of concept mappingfudgebery syidaAction Research Journal- Physics concepts underpin much higher level technical knowledge and therefore are crucial to success in many technical disciplines. However, understanding in physics concepts are quite prevalent among secondary school students. Students do not have deep understanding especially on topic Electricity. Therefore, it is important to identify and implement the most effective teaching and learning methods that can increase understanding of electricity concept . The aim of this study was to identify the significant difference of students achievement in topic electricity . The study used a experimental design method with a pre-post test. The samples were one groups of form five students from a SMK Clifford in Pahang consisting of 24 students for the experimental group respectively. The experimental group was taught physics with concept maps being one of the teaching and learning tools. Data were gathered on their learning achievements in physics test on topic electricity. It was found that the value of significant difference of mean for pre and post test is 8.33.Download Free PDFView PDFFreedom vs. Restriction of Content and Structure during Concept Mapping - Possibilities and Limitations for Construction and Assessment2012 • Alberto J CañasDownload Free PDFView PDFcmc.ihmc.usTHE TEACHING VALUE OF CONCEPT MAPSMauri Ahlberg(Åhlberg)Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
