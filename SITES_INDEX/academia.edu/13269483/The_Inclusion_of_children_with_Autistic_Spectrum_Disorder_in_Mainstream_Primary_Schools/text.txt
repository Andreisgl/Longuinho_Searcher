Following a discussion on the nature and importance of Autistic Spectrum Disorder, the paper goes on to explore two main themes: theory and policy, and the impact of inclusion on practice. The section on theory and policy considers the history of inclusive education and the importance of inclusive practice, and goes on to define and analyse the barriers to inclusion. Finally, this section analyses the specific inclusion of children with Autistic Spectrum Disorder. The section on the impact of inclusion on practice is further split into educational inclusion and social inclusion, paying particular attention to the different support and barriers affecting these issues. This paper has found that children with Autistic Spectrum Disorder are not fully included in mainstream primary schools; they experience higher rates of exclusion, lower attainment and higher rates of bullying. In order to increase the inclusion of children with Autistic Spectrum Disorder in mainstream primary schools, teachers need to address the complexity and individuality of these children and adapt their strategies accordingly. This paper concludes that the main barriers to educational and social inclusion are a lack of financial support and autism specific training for teachers.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersChoosing a secondary school for young people on the autism spectrum: A multi-informant studyProfessor Vivian HillDownload Free PDFView PDFThe experiences of learning, friendship and bullying of boys with autism in mainstream and special settings: a qualitative studyJane OgdenThis study aimed to explore experiences of learning, friendships and bullying of boys with autism attending specialist and mainstream schools, and those of their parents. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 11 boys with autism, aged 11 to 17 years, and nine of their mothers. Thematic analysis identified four key themes relating to experiences of friendships and bullying, risk factors, protective factors and outcomes. Overall, the findings indicated that five of the 11 participants had been subjected to bullying, particularly those in mainstream schools (four out of six). Further, if risk factors relating to autism or the school culture were not mediated by protective factors such as self-esteem or supportive friends, various negative outcomes were identified as more likely, including mental health issues and effects on learning and relationships. Therefore, although not inevitable, mainstream settings may increase the likelihood of negative experiences, as they have fewer resources to protect children against the risk of bullying.Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of Research in Special Educational NeedsVulnerability to bullying of children with autism spectrum conditions in mainstream education: a multi-informant qualitative exploration2015 • Jeremy OldfieldDownload Free PDFView PDFAutismHebron, J. & Humphrey, N.

Autism: The International Journal of Research and Practice. doi: 10.1177/13623613134959652013 • Judith  HebronIn recent years, research has consistently shown that children and young people with autism spectrum conditions (ASC) are more likely to be bullied than those with other or no special educational needs. The aim of the current study was to explore characteristics associated with increases (risk factors) and decreases (protective factors) in bullying. 722 teachers and 119 parents completed questionnaires on their child’s experience of being bullied, with consideration given to both individual and contextual factors. Both teachers and parents reported that behaviour difficulties and increased age were related to being bullied. Teachers also reported that having positive relationships with others and attending a special school were associated with lower levels of bullying, while the use of public/school transport to travel to and from school was accompanied by a small increase in bullying. Parents reported that pupils with identified needs but without statutory educational support were at greater risk of being bullied, although higher levels of parental engagement and confidence were associated with reductions in bullying. These findings are discussed in relation to the ASC literature, along with a reflection on the relevance of general bullying research to those with ASC, and the social inclusion of this group of children. Opportunities for intervention are considered in the light of emerging common themes, including different types of approach and the importance of the school environment.Download Free PDFView PDFSupport for LearningInclusion and the special educational needs (SEN) resource base in mainstream schools: physical factors to maximise effectiveness2013 • Keith McAllister, Karim  HadjriDownload Free PDFView PDFInternational Journal of Inclusive EducationHumphrey, N. & Hebron, J. (2014). Bullying of children and adolescents with autism spectrum conditions: A ‘state of the field’ review. International Journal of Inclusive Education. doi:10.1080/13603116.2014.9816022014 • Judith  HebronA ‘state of the field’ review of what is currently known about bullying of children and adolescents with autism spectrum conditions (ASC) is presented. We highlight compelling evidence that they are considerably more likely to be bullied than those with other or no special educational needs and disabilities. Although prevalence estimates vary from study to study, they are always worryingly high, with the highest rate reported as 94%. Those most at risk include (but are not limited to) individuals with Asperger syndrome and/or with milder deficits in social understanding, early adolescents, those attending mainstream school, and those with concurrent behavioural difficulties. Research on anti-bullying interventions for ASC is in its relative infancy. Currently available evidence suggests that a multi-level, comprehensive approach to intervention that offers parallel foci on children and young people with ASC, their peers, teaching and support staff, and the broader school ethos and climate is warranted. A crucial component of the above is the acknowledgement of the elevated risk experienced by those with ASC and the requirement to tailor interventions to their specific needs.Download Free PDFView PDFChinese children with ASDBren PetersDownload Free PDFView PDFThe experience of friendship, victimization and bullying in children with an autism spectrum disorder: Associations with child characteristics and school placement2012 • tom loucasDownload Free PDFView PDFA Comparison Between Caregiver-Reported Anxiety and Other Emotional and Behavioral Difficulties in Children and Adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorders Attending Specialist or Mainstream SchoolsNur Hani ZainalIncreasing numbers of students with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are attending mainstream schools. Nonetheless, concerns about their emotional well-being and mental health in these settings have also been raised. This study sought to compare caregiver-reported anxiety and other emotional and behavioural problems in youth with ASD attending mainstream or specialist schools. Caregivers of 27 youth with ASD in mainstream schools (age 10.91 ± 3.44 years) and 69 youth with ASD in special schools (age 10.93 ± 2.81 years) matched for gender, age, adaptive functioning and autism symptom severity scores participated. Caregivers completed the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale–Parent, a measure of adaptive functioning, and a checklist of other emotional and behavioral difficulties. Students with ASD attending mainstream schools experienced higher levels of social anxiety symptoms compared to their specialist school counterparts. No other statistically significant differences were found in other aspects of emotional and behavioural functioning examined, but some differences emerged in item-level analyses. Uncertainties in navigating more complex social environments and increased social relating difficulties in mainstream schools are discussed as probable environmental triggers for increased social phobia related symptomatology, although other explanations for this small effect size difference are also considered. Limitations of the present study and recommendations for future research focusing on exploring environmental socio-ecological factors influencing anxiety and mental health in young people with ASD are also discussed.Download Free PDFView PDFSpecial Educational Needs and Inclusion: How Have the Major Historical Changes to the Language of Special Education and Inclusive Policy Influenced the Provision for Children with SEN/D within English Primary SchoolsJoshua B .
