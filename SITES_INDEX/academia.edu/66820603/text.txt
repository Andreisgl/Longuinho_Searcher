The Quality Matters (QM)™ rubric presents a set of research-based standards on which to judge the quality of online courses. The authors of this study investigated how students’ perceptions of online course quality compare to those put forth in the QM rubric. Participants in this study n = 3,160 included students currently taking an online college-level course were invited to rate the importance of each QM standard restated from the student perspective. Students’ ratings of each item were compared to the ranking of each item received by QM (3-Essential, 2-Very Important, or 1-Important). The student rating for each item was at least 1.0 indicating that students do value the QM criteria as important to their success in an online course. Items related to having clear instructions for getting started in the course and ease of navigation were rated highly by both QM and students. However, students did not value items related to the im...Download Free PDFView PDFMeasuring Online Course Design: A Comparative AnalysisPhoebe  BallardDownload Free PDFView PDFGraduate Marketing Students’ Satisfaction in the Caribbean: A Longitudinal Case StudyRaghava Gundala, Jessica HarrigerDomestic and international competition has increased pressure on business schools to provide consistent quality service to keep existing students, as well as to recruit new students. Therefore, higher education providers must be aware of students’ expectations and implement strategies to meet and exceed these expectations. This research study seeks to determine the satisfaction levels of master’s of marketing students in a Caribbean business school through the duration of their program of study. Several statistical techniques were used in the study. The study found that while overall student satisfaction decreases over time, the factors that contribute to satisfaction change as the students’ progress through the curriculum. The results of this study will help business schools in understanding the changing needs of students at each stage in the educational process.Download Free PDFView PDFResearch Inputs and Outputs of Quality Matters:  Update to 2012 and 2014 versions of What We're Learning from QM-Focused ResearchKay ShattuckResearch continues to be an input and an output of Quality Matters (QM). This paper summarizes the QM-focused research outputs from the first decade of QM. It is an update and extension to the 2012 and 2014 What We’re Learning from QM-Focused Research paper and presentation. A number of themes have emerged from QM-focused research, including instructor and learner perceptions of quality and satisfaction, the learner voice to validate the importance of the standards, learners’ motivation to persist and complete a course, interaction of course design and teaching facilitation, the challenges of and strategies for measuring learning, and the relationship between the Community of Inquiry (CoI) and QM. Themes emerging under professional enhancement outcomes include the impact of participation in formal QM Reviews, professional development, and the impact of informal use of QM Standards and processes. Other themes that have emerged from QM-focused research include organizational impact, the continuing validation of QM tools and processes, and the alignment of QM Standards to other recognized standards of quality in online education. Discussion and recommendations for deepening the scholarly and practical approach to QM-focused research are provided.Download Free PDFView PDFPLOS ONEDevelopment of a Hybrid Course on Wheelchair Service Provision for clinicians in international contextsMary GoldbergDownload Free PDFView PDFWhat Makes a Quality Online Course?

Instructional characteristics included learner support, course design and organization, content design and delivery, interactivity (student-instructor and student-student), and assessment and evaluation. A student survey instrument was created that captures student perceptions of the instructional characteristics of their course, their learning, and their satisfaction with the course. The data collected from the student survey was merged with data from institutional student information systems (e.g., demographics and course grade).This article examines the relationship between these instructional characteristics, sometimes referred to as indicators of online course quality, and their relationship to student outcomes for all students and for underrepresented students.

Members of institutions of higher education have mixed feelings about MOOCs, ranging from those who want to offer college credit for the successful completion of MOOCs to those who fear MOOCs are the end of the university as we know it. We set forth to investigate the quality of MOOCs by using the Quality Matters quality control framework. In this paper, we present the results of our inquiry, with a specific focus on the implications the results have on day-to-day practice of designing online courses.Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of the Research Center for Educational TechnologyBlended Program Development: Applying the Quality Matters and Community of Inquiry Frameworks to Ensure High Quality Design and Implementation2009 • Scott DayDownload Free PDFView PDFMEETING THE DISTANCE EDUCATION CHALLENGE: A GUIDE FOR DESIGNING ONLINE CLASSROOMSPatrick BungardThe emphasis on education fluctuates with the economy. When education is encouraged, many individuals flock to colleges and universities to increase earning potential or achieve goals. Thanks to advancements in technology, distance education in the 21st century can be similar to face-to-face education. Students spend many hours sitting in front of a computer completing course work. Although still in infancy stages, online education has vastly improved. Perspectives like teaching adults (andragogy), transformative learning, and teacher immediacy all address teaching individuals from afar. In consultation with these three perspectives, several qualitative measures have been developed aid with online course design. This graduate project intends to assist faculty with setting up an online course using Andragogy, Transformative Learning Theory, and Teacher Immediacy as the backbone. In addition, the Quality Online Course Initiative, Quality Matters, and Quality Online Learning and Teaching tools are applied.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
