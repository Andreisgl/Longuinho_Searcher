Many of these models are based on a light-use efficiency equation and two-component model of whole-plant growth and maintenance respiration that have been parameterized for distinct vegetation types and biomes. This study was designed to assess the robustness of these parameters for predicting interannual plant growth and carbon exchange, and more specifically to address inconsistencies that may arise during forest disturbances and the loss of canopy foliage. A model based on the MODIS MOD17 algorithm was parameterized for a mature upland hardwood forest by inverting CO2 flux tower observations during years when the canopy was not disturbed. This model was used to make predictions during a year when the canopy was 37% defoliated by forest tent caterpillars. Predictions improved after algorithms were modified to scale for the effects of diffuse radiation and loss of leaf area. Photosynthesis and respiration model parameters were found to be robust at daily and annual time scales regardless of canopy disturbance, and differences between modeled net ecosystem production and tower net ecosystem exchange were only approximately 2 g C m−2 d−1 and less than 23 g C m−2 y−1. Canopy disturbance events such as insect defoliations are common in temperate forests of North America, and failure to account for cyclical outbreaks of forest tent caterpillars in this stand could add an uncertainty of approximately 4–13% in long-term predictions of carbon sequestration.Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of Geophysical Research: AtmospheresProfiles of photosynthetically active radiation, nitrogen and photosynthetic capacity in the boreal forest: Implications for scaling from leaf to canopy1997 • Qing-lai DangDownload Free PDFView PDFRemote Sensing of EnvironmentRemote sensing of photosynthetic light-use efficiency across two forested biomes: Spatial scaling2010 • Chris Hopkinson, Natascha KljunEddy covariance (EC) measurements have greatly advanced our knowledge of carbon exchange in terrestrial ecosystems. However, appropriate techniques are required to upscale these spatially discrete findings globally. Satellite remote sensing provides unique opportunities in this respect, but remote sensing of the photosynthetic light-use efficiency (ε), one of the key components of Gross Primary Production, is challenging. Some progress has been made in recent years using the photochemical reflectance index, a narrow waveband index centered at 531 and 570 nm. The high sensitivity of this index to various extraneous effects such as canopy structure, and the view observer geometry has so far prevented its use at landscape and global scales. One critical aspect of upscaling PRI is the development of generic algorithms to account for structural differences in vegetation. Building on previous work, this study compares the differences in the PRI: ɛ relationship between a coastal Douglas-fir forest located on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, and a mature Aspen stand located in central Saskatchewan, Canada. Using continuous, tower-based observations acquired from an automated multi-angular spectro-radiometer (AMSPEC II) installed at each site, we demonstrate that PRI can be used to measure ɛ throughout the vegetation season at the DF-49 stand (r2 = 0.91, p < 0.00) as well as the deciduous site (r2 = 0.88, p < 0.00). It is further shown that this PRI signal can be also observed from space at both sites using daily observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) and a multi-angular implementation of atmospheric correction (MAIAC) (r2 = 0.54 DF-49; r2 = 0.63 SOA; p < 0.00). By implementing a simple hillshade model derived from airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) to approximate canopy shadow fractions (αs), it is further demonstrated that the differences observed in the relationship between PRI and ε at DF-49 and SOA can be attributed largely to differences in αs. The findings of this study suggest that algorithms used to separate physiological from extraneous effects in PRI reflectance may be more broadly applicable and portable across these two climatically and structurally different biome types, when the differences in canopy structure are known.Download Free PDFView PDFMulti-Angle Remote Sensing of Forest Light Use Efficiency2007 • Guillaume DroletTower flux measurements over forests continue to contribute valuable understanding to Earth Systems Science and lay the foundations for new remote sensing measurement techniques. Using analytic methods and tower- based, quasi-continuous, full-spectrum observations of a Douglas fir forest over nearly 6 months, we demonstrate that stress-induced variations in measured photochemical reflectance index (PRI) with canopy light use efficience (LUE) are a direct result of xanthophyll-induced changes in leaf level reflectance at 531 nm, and can be observed at multi-canopy scales These conclusions are drawn inferentially from both analysis and observation. The key to our findings is the ability to continuously measure the reflectance of the Douglas fir forest as a function of shadow fraction from the hotspot to the "cold spot" and a new finding that the magnitude of an normalized difference reflectance index (NDRI) formed from two spectral bands cannot vary significantly with shadow fraction unless the reflectance of the shaded and sunlit leaves differ in at least one of the reflectance bands. Our findings suggest a new sensor and methodology for the direct retrieval from space of xanthophyll-induced changes in the LUE by measuring PRI as a function of shadow fraction using a multi-angle spectrometer simultaneously retrieving both shadow fraction and PRI. Such observations, when used in combination with physiological models should provide a greatly improved capability to monitor surface atmosphere exchanges of carbon, water and heat.Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of Geophysical Research: BiogeosciencesEstimating Daily Forest Carbon Fluxes Using a Combination of Ground and Remotely Sensed Data2015 • Donatella SpanoDownload Free PDFView PDFAgricultural and Forest MeteorologySpatial modelling of photosynthesis for a boreal mixedwood forest by integrating micrometeorological, lidar and hyperspectral remote sensing data2009 • Paul TreitzDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
