This thesis examines questions of place-making and identity formation in Contemporary Art, and their influence on artistic and exhibition practice into the early twenty-first century. Its research scope encompasses global considerations of decolonisation, cultural displacement, migration, translocality and environmental disruption, explored from a range of perspectives, including the transnational imaginary of a Global South. The research arises from the author’s curatorial work, and its arguments are ‘bookended’ by two curatorial case studies for recent exhibitions, contextualising the research as a response to questions arising from exhibition practice. With an emphasis on both artist-focussed practice and viewer experience, some key curatorial values – locality, identity, discursivity and affectivity – are identified as an analytical and evaluative framework to examine diverse exhibitionary forms and practices worldwide. Key contexts and terms of reference are established at the outset, followed – in Chapter 2: Narratives – by an art-historical framing for the research, interrogating established Euro-American narratives, and investigating the emerging structures and networks of a rapidly-globalising ‘exhibitionary complex’ (Bennett, 1988). The multi-scalar manifestations of this ‘Global Contemporary’ are examined through multiple lenses, including a history of influential exhibitions, emerging platforms and curatorial developments. These investigations are further contextualised – in Chapter 3: Topologies – in relation to recent literature on locality, identity and affect, across a range of related disciplines, encompassing art history and theory; critical theory; anthropology and spirituality studies; spatial, social and cultural histories; and aspects of contemporary economics and politics. Chapter 4: Praxis is focussed on curatorial and exhibition practice across numerous sites and exhibition platforms worldwide, with an emphasis on major museums and recurrent international exhibition platforms such as biennials and triennials. It investigates diverse deterritorialised and precarious forms of art and ‘non-art’ practice, and the challenges faced by curators in presenting such practices in contemporary exhibitions, concluding with a reflection on socially-engaged practice. Chapter 5: Curatorial Case Studies provides detailed analysis of two exhibitions studied as part of field research in Europe and the Middle East, and Chapter 6: Futures explores emerging trends and possible future developments for exhibition practice, suggesting some sightlines to the future for the independent art sector. This is followed by a second Curatorial Case Study – for the exhibition platform The Museum of Dissensus – addressing issues arising from the research. Conclusion summarises key research arguments and findings.Download Free PDFView PDFConflict, Justice, Decolonization: Critical Studies on Inter-Asian SocietiesBorders and Museums: Exclusion through Social Inclusion2020 • Fernan TalamayanThe study of borders involves an analysis of infrastructures and mechanisms that allow for their multiplication and crystallization, one of which is the museum. In this essay, I explain various ways in which museums can supposedly facilitate integration and social inclusion. At the same time, I question this theoretical capacity of museums to dispel borders by examining the relationship between exclusion and inclusion, as well as the intricacies and implications of social integration in the context of museums. In particular, I reflect on Tam-awan Village—a “living museum” envisioned to promote both the Cordilleran people’s welfare and indigenous culture—to present the seemingly inevitable reproduction of subjectivities and borders in postcolonial societies.Download Free PDFView PDFContemporary Artist Residencies Reclaiming Time and SpaceContemporary Artist Residencies Reclaiming Time and Space2019 • Francisco GuevaraTime and space are sine qua non for artist residencies. Although residency models and their roles are numerous and diverse, especially considering their different contexts and missions, anyone around the world who engages with residencies is confronted by the question of time and space. From the perspective of residency owners and managers, and in a practical sense, in terms of re- sources, the questions of place and duration are always primary considerations. Also, in the process of selecting a location and developing an artistic intention, artists will decide based on the variables of space and length of time. Even when we approach the practice from a theoretical perspective, all definitions of residencies include the two concepts of time and space; although many other aspects in terms of the residency field are debatable, the problem of time and space will always remain central. In this essay, I will present a more complex analysis of the historical and ideological implications of the practice of artist residencies. As in Sharon P. Holland’s ground-breaking work, I will use her approximation to the historical problem of the face-to-face encounter, which includes acknowledging Frantz Fanon’s observation in the time/space continuum, to understand the structural impediments and inequalities in the phenomenological readings of time and space in the context of residencies. In that regard, I will introduce what Holland refers to as the persistent problem of ‘past’ as ‘place’, that especially residencies in the Global South have to confront on a daily basis. What happens when an artist engages with artistic processes while immersed in a community where its culture, people, and even the place itself have been imagined and re-imagined by art history and, in general, the dominant visual culture? How can residencies become an affront to ‘the order of things’ and seize the opportunity to interrupt the violent continuity of history? I will depart from Arquetopia’s mission by beginning with a brief context on the historical development of the model of artist residencies as a result of the expansion of European empires. I will then elaborate on how Arquetopia’s sustainable model has guaranteed its steady growth to become a transcontinental foundation and residency programme, allowing autonomy while en- forcing ethical responsibility, especially considering the problematic relations between art and power. With the understanding of residencies as spaces where important ethical questions intersect, I will especially elaborate on Arquetopia’s ethical commitment to approaching international encounters as opportunities for historical and ideological interruptions by introducing Emmanuel Levinas’ ethics as the core of its methodology.Download Free PDFView PDF“Urban Cultural Studies—A Manifesto [part 2].” (2014)Benjamin  FraserDownload Free PDFView PDF“On Territoriality, Temporality, and the Politics of Place,” The And: An Expanded Questionnaire on The Contemporary, Field Notes, Asia Art Archive Journal Vol. 001 (2012)Atreyee GuptaDownload Free PDFView PDFJMK 4(2) – December 2019 – Artistic Strategies of Migration: Art as a Resistance or as a Reinsurance? – ed. by Erik Berggren & Elsa Claire Gomis2019 • ICSR Mediterranean KnowledgeThemes and Perspectives BERGGREN, E. − Representation, Victimization or Identification.
