Tourism and wetland conservation: Application of travel cost and willingness to pay an entry fee at Ghodaghodi Lake Complex, NepalThis study investigated the need and applicability of wetland tourism for resource conservation, ... more This study investigated the need and applicability of wetland tourism for resource conservation, using the case of Ghoda-ghodi Lake Complex, a Ramsar Site in western Nepal. The travel cost method (TCM) was used to determine the recreation potential of the lake complex, while the contingent valuation method (CVM) was used to calculate willingness of visitors to pay an entry fee as a payment vehicle for conservation. The per capita travel cost was found to be NPR 540 (US $7.71), while the mean willingness to pay an entry fee was NPR 34 (US $0.48) per visitor per entry. In addition, factors affecting wetland visitation rates and maximum willingness to pay were identified. Policy implications include the establishment of an entry fee system to offset conservation budgetary constraints, government investment in social benefits equating to at least per capita travel cost identified, and public-private partnerships, with community participation in tourism promotion and wetland conservation.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Advertising creates awareness among thepotential buyers of the product and also poses the product as a need even if it is a want in reality. This study analyzedcontents of 1749 marketing messages of Geographic Information (GI) product advertisements over the period of twodecades (1989 to 2008). A tailored methodology was developed based on the approach of Resnick and Stern (1977).The contents analyzed include changing pattern of marketing message in the area of picture and text ratio, relevancyof headline message, sub-headline message and picture to the advertised products, image colour depth, and messagemedia. The use of picture dominated the text in the second half of the study period. A majority of the headlinemessages were of a direct product descriptive nature while the use of indirect product descriptive type gainedmomentum lately. The use of sub-headline message was found to be comparatively low. Pictorial elements/images ofthe products were mirrored in a majority of the marketing messages. Photorealistic image dominated the messagehaving the combination of both image and text. The study also revealed that marketing messages of GIS softwareproducts were dominant in the first half while it was GPS/survey product in the second half. No significantrelationship was found between various elements of the GI product marketing messages. Based on the above findings,the likely future trends of GI product marketing messages were predicted.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Community-based conservation is an approach for sustainable management of the wetlands near settlements.This study investigated willingness to pay of local people for community-based conservation activities and the variablesaffecting it in the Ghodaghodi Lake Complex, Nepal. A sample of 217 households residing near the lake complex wassurveyed. The result showed that households were willing to pay for community-based conservation activities, at an averageof NPR 378 (US$5.4) per annum. The age of the household head, wetland income, agricultural income and priorexperiences on participation in conservation activities positively affected household’s willingness to pay. Governmentexpenditure of at least the amount of willingness to pay estimated by this study for the community-based conservationactivities would be economically and environmentally justified.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
