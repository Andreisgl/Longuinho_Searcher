We prioritized articles that showed how ubuntu could be used and applied in social work as well as those with a visual model representing ubuntu. Advances in technology and rapid growth of social media requires that we promote and use visual learning tools for social work especially for the young learner. This special issue’s objective was to accelerate use of concepts, models, theories and approaches that fill the gaps left by western approaches that are being put aside as Africa decolonises social work. Another objective was to encourage participation of young writers in decolonisation and indigenisation. In this editorial article, we define ubuntu, summarise existing ubuntu models in social work before sharing information about this special issue of the African Journal of Social Work (AJSW).

Birth Registration and Perceived Social Exclusion: Insights from Participants' NarrativesSouthern African Journal of Social Work and Social Development,  2018Birth registration is becoming an important arena of political mobilisation for human rights. Dis... more Birth registration is becoming an important arena of political mobilisation for human rights. Discourses about civil registration advanced in the civil society and academic circles tend to frame birth registration in citizenship terms, arguing that (a)Â a birth certificate is indispensable in realising the childâ€™s right to a name, nationality and citizenship, and (b)Â both the delay in registering and failure to register a childâ€™s birth compound the social exclusion of that child. However, narratives that connect birth registration and social exclusion in a causal relationship are seldom premised on empirical evidence. Drawing on qualitative key informant interviews, this article examines how non-birth registration relates to social exclusion of children. Participantsâ€™ narratives generated in Zimbabweâ€™s Bindura District revealed that non-birth registration is entangled with multiple dimensions of social exclusion, potentially giving rise to marginalisation of children in var...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This article seeks to understand transformations in decision-making in six Zimbabwean transnational families. This is done by examining qualitative data generated through semi-structured interviews with members of the migrant families. While accentuating the need for more research on interpersonal processes in transnational families, the article illustrates that shifts in gender roles may occur alongside gender-normative behaviours that maintain women in subordinate decision-making roles.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Yet, part... more Advocacy is a crucial vehicle for realising social work’s commitment to social justice. Yet, particularly in South Africa, little is known about social work research on advocacy. Therefore, this article uses a qualitative systematic review of published research on advocacy in South Africa’s social welfare sector in order to evaluate the contribution of social work research. It finds that there is scant research on social welfare advocacy in South Africa. Based on these findings, the article suggests areas for further social work research on advocacy in South Africa’s social welfare sector.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Therefore, this article examines narratives of suffering provided by Zimbabwean non-migrant women. It demonstrates that the absence of men from the home creates a multidimensional deficit – not only a loss of caring hands but also forcing non-migrant women to double-up on the responsibilities in the family. Factors connected to women’s suffering include overwhelming responsibility at home and emotional insecurity created by prolonged separation and the potential disintegration of familial bonds. The article also considers the implications of non-migrant women’s experiences for social work research.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Based on a qualitative study of six Zimbabwean migrant fathers in Johannesburg and three non-migrant women in Zimbabwe, this article argues that transnational migration at once presents opportunities for and obstacles to the reconstitution of gender-normative forms of parental involvement in migrant families. The analysis of the narratives of migrant men and their spouses demonstrates that, although maternal and paternal roles may become considerably indistinct in the context of transnational separations, non-migrant women may emphasize gender-normative expectations in their negotiations with distant fathers when faced with huge responsibilities at home. Such negotiations tend to reinforce gender-normative parenting in transnational split families. http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This paper examines the efficacy of extended family system in OVC care and support in the Gutu District of Zimbabwe. This a qualitative phenomenological study was used to gather data of the lived experiences and perceptions of the 10 caregivers of Batanai HIV/AIDS service organization support groups and 10 OVC purposively sampled in the Gutu District of Zimbabwe. The findings overwhelmingly reveal that the extended family in Zimbabwe is still compatible and predominantly utilized as the OVC safety net more than the residential or orphanage care system. The poor living conditions of OVC are being misrepresented as abuse and exploitation by the critics of extended family care and support system. The study concluded and recommended that the ...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

He/she is the key person in facilitating conversations during fieldwork and in making sense of the data. Methodological literature underscores the fact that assuming insider positions or identities during fieldwork aids qualitative researchers in achieving genuine collaboration, which is necessary for collecting trustworthy data. Furthermore, the contingency nature of positionality has been acknowledged sufficiently in literature: whilst the researcher positions himself or herself, he or she is simultaneously positioned by participants. Despite these insights, the manner in which the researchers&#39; identities unfold during fieldwork interactions has attracted little attention in social science scholarship. Detailed accounts of how the researcher might influence the processes of positionality in order to engage participants in a productive collaboration are few.

It is based on narratives provided by Zimbabweans in Johannesburg, and considers what this relationship might imply for how we understand circular migration. It finds that, differential inclusion – emanating from migrants’ experiences of deportability, insecure residence, marginal economic practices, uncertain futurity and temporal disruptions, that punctuated their post-arrival everyday life – shapes migrants’ perceptions of home as a concrete site left behind to which migrants strive to return. Conversely, negative evaluations of livelihood opportunities in Zimbabwe fuel an orientation towards an imminent yet continually deferred eventual return.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Yet, the potential of using frames that draw on indigenous ways of knowing, in children’s work, remain unrealised since social workers prefer Western models and theories. Ubuntu inspired models of social work view children from family, community, environmental and spiritual perspectives. In contrast, Western models are inspired by individualitic values,  governmental policies and professional viewpoints. However, as will be shown in this article, foreign models have failed to live up to expectations because they tend to disempower and diminish the strengths of everyone involved in case situations. For example, the social worker has to administer a model that they are not fully familiar with or which contradicts their own values. The family is forced to adopt values that they do not know let alone believe in.
