I am attempting to think about the ways that rock ’n’ roll functions as a musical revolution that becomes subjected to a narrative of loss accompanying the belief that the revolution has floundered, or even disappeared completely. In order to think about what this narrative of loss might entail I have found myself going back to the emergence of rock ’n’ roll, to what we might term its ‘event’, and then working towards the present to take stock of the current situation. The article is divided into three parts. Part One attempts to think of the emergence of rock ’n’ roll and its attendant discourse alongside Alain Badiou’s notion of event, looking at ways in which listening subjects are formed. Part Two continues the discussion of listening subjectivity while shifting the focus to objects associated with phonography. Part Three attends to a number of difficulties encountered in the Badiouian project and asks to what extent rock music might be thought of as a lost cause. All three parts deal with notions of subjectivity, love and fidelity.Download Free PDFView PDFChapter 5: Fidelity’s End?Richard  ElliottDownload Free PDFView PDFChapter 4: ‘I’m Awfully Bitter These Days’: Freedom, Yearning and Defeat in Nina Simone’s Late VoiceRichard  ElliottDownload Free PDFView PDFWhen the music's over...Richard  ElliottDownload Free PDFView PDFChapter 3: Reconstructing the Event: Spectres of Terror in Latin American New SongRichard  ElliottDownload Free PDFView PDFChapter 2: Songs of Disquietude: Loss in Fado Music from the 1950s to the PresentRichard  ElliottDownload Free PDFView PDFThesis contents and abstractRichard  ElliottDownload Free PDFView PDFOh Boy!

It rehearses some key issues raised by recent theorists who have been interested in the connections between these themes before proceeding to discuss tropes of displacement in Dylan's work. Topics covered include the importance of the city and its projection of the rural, the theme of moving on and its association with accumulated experience, and the ability of Dylan continually to reinvent himself. The article closes with a reflection on the album Time Out of Mind as a distillation of themes of place and displacement that can be found throughout Dylan's work and argues that the work presents a poetics of displacement that cannot shed the pull of place and the desire for homely permanence.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
