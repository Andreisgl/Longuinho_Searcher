Scientific Essays of Higher EducationThe variations of address forms in multilingual and multicultural contexts create problems in their understanding, proper choice, and usage. The goal of this study is to identify the main categories of forms of address used by students and teachers in multilingual Pakistani universities and to highlight the socio-cultural factors that determine their choice and preference in various contexts, both formal and informal. An open-ended questionnaire was distributed for data collection in four public sector universities in the Sindh province of Pakistan. The material obtained from 252 participants was supplemented and verified through ethnographic observation and analyzed employing both quantitative and qualitative research paradigms. The preliminary results show that in multilingual academic settings, Pakistani interlocutors use a variety of categories of address forms with the domineering position of names and kinship terms. Speaking Pakistani English, they use both English and local t...See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersLANGUAGE IN INDIAAttitudes Toward Women Expressed In the Speech of Male College StudentsB.A. Mahalakshmi PrasadDownload Free PDFView PDFThe Journal of Pan-African StudiesNaming in Master's Thesis Acknowledgements within Two Ghanaian University Departments2017 • joseph affulIntroductionNaming practices, in general, and address terms, in particular, constitute undoubtedly an important verbal behaviour among humans. The commonest set of studies on naming has focused on familial settings. Such studies include Evans-Pritchard&#39;s (1948) on naming practices among the Nuer along the Nile in Egypt. Address terms have not only been largely examined in several socio-cultural settings (e.g. Goodenough, 1965; Fang & Heng, 1983; Fitch, 1991; Aceto, 2002), following the most frequently mentioned study by Brown and Gilman&#39;s (1960) work, but also been studied in social institutions and practices such as politics (Jaworski & Galasinski, 2000; Fetzer & Bull, 2004), and religion (Sequeira, 1993; Dzameshie, 1997; Wharry, 2003). Address forms have been studied in different languages (see, for example, Bates & Benigni, 1975; Brown & Gilman, 1960; Brown & Ford, 1961; Chandrasekhar, 1970; Cintra, 1972; Paulston, 1976; Ostor, 1982; Oyetade, 1995).Admittedly, there are v...Download Free PDFView PDFBook Abstract -ICLAP 2016Maria Isabel Maldonado GarciaDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Languages, Linguistics and Literary StudiesThe honorific styles of the etnolinguistic communities: An ethnographyLisa SeraficaThe purpose of this descriptive-qualitative study with ethnographic design was to explore the extant honorific styles of the identified ethnolinguistic communities. Data from 37 selected participants from the Mandaya, Kagan, and Mansaka Tribes of Tagum City who took part in the KII and FGD interview using validated qualitative interview guide pointed to insight. Based on the analyses of data, the findings reveal the existence of the following appellative honorifics: Kinship, Sub-kinship, Rank, Aged, Professional, No Naming, and Identity Honorifics in the Mandaya, Kagan, and Mansaka Tribes of Tagum City. Moreover, it is also found that bound morpheme markers such as ma, dag, da, pyag, an, gi, on, ka, di, and ba exist in the dialects of the ethnolinguistic communities which describe and define the person’s characteristics and abilities in the honorific styles.Download Free PDFView PDFLinguistics and Literature StudiesFormentelli Maicol (2018) Strategies of address in English Lingua Franca (ELF) academic interactions. Linguistics and Literature Studies, 6(6), pp. 298-306. ISSN: 2331-6438.2018 • Maicol FormentelliThe paper describes the address practices reported by students and lecturers from three English-taught master’s degrees organised at a small Italian university where English is used as a lingua franca (ELF) of communication. The main aim of the study is to ascertain whether and how the multilingual and multicultural composition of the ELF classroom influences participants in their choice of address strategies in English. The findings show two main patterns of address in the ELF courses: 1) an asymmetrical, non-reciprocal use of address strategies, in which lecturers take an informal and familiar stance (T-forms), while students tend to express deference and respect (V-forms); 2) a reciprocal, symmetrical use of V-forms that encodes formality and mutual respect. While informality is promoted by lecturers as part of the policies of the master’s programmes, some students and lecturers show resistance to the use of familiar address terms and favour formal strategies to convey respect to the interlocutor. The informants’ comments recorded in the questionnaires reveal that participants’ cultural backgrounds, previous experience in their home universities, and assumptions about the interlocutor’s cultural expectations play a significant role in shaping address practices in ELF academic courses.Download Free PDFView PDFMultilingualism in Sindh, Pakistan: the functions of code-switching used by educated, multilingual Sindhi women and the factors driving its use2018 • farida panhwarThe present study explores the functions of code-switching and the factors which motivate speakers to use it in the context of informal conversations among educated, multilingual Sindhi women at four colleges in Hyderabad and Kotri, Pakistan. Following on from such scholars as Blom and Gumperz (1972), Gumperz (1982), Myers-Scotton (1993a), Poplack (1980), this study uses a qualitative methodology consisting of audio recordings of informal interactions, the questionnaires filled in by the participants, which reveal their demographic information and observation notes by the researcher during the audio recordings. The data is then analysed using an interpretive approach. The findings provide evidence that code-switching is employed as a language strategy to achieve particular social goals. Multilingual code-switching into Sindhi, Urdu and English and a few instances of Arabic and other local languages provide sufficient evidence of participants’ linguistic competence.

This phenomenon is supported by the fact that the tradition is rarely performed and the texts of Ambon Malay pantun are rarely found, whether in the form of books or other manuscripts. In manuscripts or books containing Ambon Malay pantuns still and read and delivered nowadays, there are some pantun that are no longer obedient to the standard structure of pantun, like rhymes and stanza. In addition, there are many rhymes that appear to be newly created by some writers, so that the dictionary words choice no longer seem to heed the pantun. This paper aims to unveil the phenomenon of the shift of diction or the choice of words in Ambonese pantun through the poetic theoretical approach. In addition to indicating a change or linguistic shift in the Ambon Malay pantun, this paper is also expected to mark the change or shift of poetics of the Malay pantun as an oral tradition or oral literature.Download Free PDFView PDFRussian Journal of LinguisticsKinship terms as indicators of identity and social reality: A case study of Syrian Arabic and Hindi2021 • Amr KhalilBy displaying a certain fragment of reality in the linguistic consciousness of a person, socio-cognitive categories convey important information about the social structure of society, the lingua-cultural identity of its representatives and the values they share. This study focuses on kinship terms in the Syrian Arabic and Hindi languages. It is aimed at identifying similarity and the cultural specificity of kinship terms in two linguistic cultures and explaining the identified features through types of cultures and cultural values. The research is based on kinship terms that name consanguineal (blood) and affinal (non-blood) relatives in Arabic and Hindi. The material was collected through analysis of terms in dictionaries as well as anonymous questionnaires and observation. The collected material was systematized and analyzed using comparative, definitional, semantic and lingua-cultural methods. The results showed that both languages have a rich system of kinship terms, in which th...Download Free PDFView PDFTurkish EFL Teachers' Familiarity of and Perceived Needs for Language Testing and Assesment LiteracyÖznur Semiz, Kubra OdabasThere has been a growing interest in examining teachers’ competency and practice of assessment literacy which concerns teacher’s knowledge and skills of assessing and evaluating student learning. This study aimed to investigate a group of Turkish EFL teachers’ familiarity of and training needs for language testing and assessment literacy. To this end, a 47- item questionnaire adapted from Guerin (2010) was administered to 48 EFL teachers in Trabzon, Turkey. Findings showed that majority of the respondents expressed a familiarity with testing and assessment issues yet reported a need for further training to improve their understanding of assessment literacy. The results have implications for designing training programs for language teachers in Turkey.Download Free PDFView PDFTHE ROUTLEDGE HANDBOOK OF LANGUAGE AND CULTUREHamed  FathiThe Routledge Handbook of Language and Culture presents the first comprehensive survey of research on the relationship between language and culture.
