This study aimed to investigate the changes over time in proportion of vaccination coverage across demographic subgroups in Bangladesh. Method Vaccination coverage for children 12–59 months of age was obtained from Bangladesh’s 2011, 2014, and 2017-18 Demographic and Health Surveys. Three multivariable binary logistic regression models with complete vaccination status at each survey data were used to generate adjusted odds ratios to uncover immunization variations across socio-demographic categories. Further, to detect potential geographic disparities, changes over time were analyzed at both the country and district levels. Findings Vaccination coverage grew from 88.1% in 2011 to 89.2% in 2017–2018, indicating a gap of more than ten percent for complete immunization coverage among children aged 12–59 months. Children aged 23–35 were more likely to have full vaccinatio...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Effects of Moringa oleifera on working memory: an experimental study with memory-impaired Wistar rats tested in radial arm mazeBMC Research NotesObjective Memory impairment is a serious problem that has a significant negative impact on surviv... more Objective Memory impairment is a serious problem that has a significant negative impact on survival and quality of life. When used for a long time, drugs used to treat memory loss become less effective and have more side effects, making therapy more difficult. Different medicinal plants are now being highlighted because of their valuable applications and low risk of adverse effects. Moringa oleifera is one of these plants that has gained much attention due to its diverse biological functions. The study aimed to determine the effects of Moringa oleifera on working memory in memory-impaired Wistar rats. Results For this experimental study, 30 male Wistar rats having 150–250 g bodyweight were divided equally into three groups: Group-I/normal memory group (treated with oral normal saline 5 ml/kg body weight), Group-II/memory-impaired group (induced by intraperitoneal ketamine 15 mg/kg body weight), and Group-III/experimental group (treated with oral Moringa oleifera 200 mg/kg bodyweight...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In Bangladesh, conventional medicine is a common approach for health care practices, yet, due to Bangladesh’s high out-of-pocket payment, millions of people utilise CAM-based healthcare services for illnesses. In Bangladesh, there is a scarcity of data on how CAM is perceived and utilised. The goal of this study was to determine the proportion and correlates of the utilisation of CAM among patients visiting a tertiary level hospital, in Bangladesh. Methods A cross-sectional survey involving 1,183 patients who received health care from a hospital in Bangladesh was interviewed for this study. The associated factors on utilising CAM were identified using multivariable logistic regression analysis. Results Thirty-three percent of patients utilised CAM exclusively to treat their illnesses, whereas the rest utilised conventional me...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This study is another attempt to identify the factors that increase the risk for CHD as it is an extremely important area in health sciences. Utilizing the Framingham data about a wide variety of risk factors associated with CHD,researchers are now working to develop better tools to assess overall risk. The incidence of CHD was recorded along with patients age, sex and cholesterol level in the study. Logistic regression was used to model the log odds of developing CHD as a function of cholesterol category (0: &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt; 190 mg/100 ml, 1: 190-219 mg/ml, 2: 220-249 mg/100ml, 37 colon; 250 mg/100ml), adjusting for age, sex and their interaction. The analysis showed that serum cholesterol level is a risk factor of coronary heart disease, but its effect is modified by the age category of the subjects. Sex is also associated with CHD, and moreover the effect of age on the 12-year incidence of CHD is gender-dependent.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Increasing Burden of Multidrug Resistant Tuberculosis in HIV Infected Individuals: A Systematic Review and Meta-AnalysisSSRN Electronic Journal,  2020Background: The increasing burden of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in HIV infected in... more Background: The increasing burden of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in HIV infected individuals is a serious threat to global tuberculosis control programs. The study aimed to summarize the available evidences on the association of HIV infection and the development of MDR-TB and, finally, to provide an up-to-datepooled estimate of risks. Methods: We searched on PubMed, Google Scholar, and ScienceDirect databases to select eligible studies for our systematic review and meta-analysis, published between January 1, 2010, and July 30,2019. Two sets of reviewers independently extracted data and assessed the methodological quality of the studies using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Subgroup analysis was pre-specified to perform according to the continent, country, income level, study design, mean/median age, and type of MDR-TB. The random-effects model was used to obtain the pooled odds ratio of the crude association between HIV infection and MDR-TB with a 95% confidence interval. We investigated the potential publication bias by checking funnel plot asymmetry and using the Egger’s test. Moreover, we assessed the heterogeneity using Cochran’s Q test and the I2 statistic. Findings: We identified 1496 studies through a database search, and after subsequent elimination based on our eligibility criteria, we selected 47 articles, including 60,754 participants. The pooled odds ratio was 1.47 (95% CI= 1.19-1.81) with substantial heterogeneity (I2=80.49%), and there was no evidence of publication bias (p=0.13). Subgroup analysis revealed that the estimated pooled odds ratio for European countries (OR=2.31, 95% CI= 1.80-2.96, I2=32.26%) was higher than the other three continents (South American, Asia, and Africa). Further analysis showed that the effect estimate was higher for primary MDR-TB (OR=3.13, 95% CI= 1.59-6.13, I2=13.13%) with no heterogeneity among the studies. There was also a trend towards increased risk of MDR-TB for HIV patients of 40 years and older (OR=1.96, 95% CI= 1.41-2.73, I2=69.11%) and women HIV patients (OR=1.97, 95% CI 1.03-3.78, I2=80.35%). The MDR-TB is found to be significant in high burden of TB/HIV countries (OR=1.51, 95% CI= 1.18-1.92, I2=78.1%) and in high-income countries (OR=2.64, 95% CI= 2.01-3.48, I2=15.01%). Interpretation:The risk of MDR-TB increases significantly among HIV infected individuals from the last decade. The most considerable burden of MDR-TB in HIV individuals was found in Europe and the women HIV patients with age 40 years and older are most in the risk of MDR-TB. Funding Statement: The authors stated: &quot;There was a student seed fund for this study. The corresponding author had full access to all study data and the authorized person for the final submission of the paper for publication.&quot; Declaration of Interests: The authors declare no competing interests.

Inconsistent findings on the association between HIV infection and MDR-TB were present in many studies. We aimed to review existing data on the relationship between HIV infection and MDR-TB systematically to assess the contribution of HIV on MDR-TB worldwide. We also investigated the patterns of MDR-TB by age, country-wise income, study designs, and global regions.

Our results suggest that there are four major clusters among the countries. First cluster consists of 8 countries where cumulative infected cases and deaths are highest. It is also revealed that there are two principal components. The countries which play vital role to explain the 60\% variation of the total variations by the firs...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
HIV infection and multidrug resistant tuberculosis: a systematic review and meta-analysisBMC Infectious Diseases,  2021Background Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in HIV infected individuals is a serious thr... more Background Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in HIV infected individuals is a serious threat to global efforts to combat tuberculosis. Inconsistent findings on the association between HIV infection and MDR-TB were present in many studies. We aimed to review existing data on the relationship between HIV infection and MDR-TB systematically to assess the contribution of HIV on MDR-TB worldwide. We also investigated the patterns of MDR-TB by age, country-wise income, study designs, and global regions. Methods We utilized PubMed, Google Scholar, and ScienceDirect databases to select eligible studies for meta-analysis that were published between January 12,010, and July 30, 2020. The random-effects model was used to obtain the pooled odds ratio of the crude association between HIV and MDR-TB with a 95% confidence interval. We investigated the potential publication-bias by checking funnel plot asymmetry and using the Egger’s test. Moreover, we assessed the heterogeneity using the I...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
