The excavations initiated by antiquarians from Western Europe, who were interested mainly in Classical antiquity and were enthusiastic in Mycenaean remains. The first archaeologists who published those excavations were influenced by the Colonialist and Nationalist ideas of their time. Therefore those ideas are reflected in their finds from Enkomi. Another problem is the heritage management of this site, in particular, the factor that encourages public engagement at an archaeological site. In the Cypriot environment, there are two main political and cultural identities, the “Turkish Cypriot” and the “Greek Cypriot”. This problem is the consequence of the first issue. Specifically, the archaeological site of Enkomi has been neglected in terms of preservation or heritage development because it was always related to the idea that it was the first site which was “colonised” by Mycenaeans – Greeks. As a result, the TRNC (Turkish Republic of North Cyprus) did not put a lot of effort to preserve the site because it was out of their political interest. Also, another reason that Enkomi was neglected was the attitude of creating passive archaeological parks in Southern Europe. In order to deal with this complex problem, this project aims to find a sustainable heritage plan for the archaeological site of Enkomi. To achieve this, I will first discuss the history of research of Enkomi including the nationalistic approaches and colonial approaches in Enkomi as well as the current condition of the site. The second part of the thesis aims to explain the Archaeology and Heritage in Cyprus in the modern context. Thus, it presents a narrative of the history of the island and the ideologies that resulted from and developed throughout the conflict history of the island. Then, I will describe the results of modern history on heritage activities at Enkomi. The third part of the current project provides a heritage plan for Enkomi. The example of the plan gives an idea of how specialists can construct a new harmonic reality in a conflict environment through public archaeology. Through this research, I will analyse the issues that are typical for sites with problems like ancient Enkomi in order to develop a sustainable solution for a heritage project with archaeological sites with similar problems as ancient Enkomi. The sustainable management of the site will try to incorporate experts (archaeologists, heritage managers, etc.) and the public (=not archaeologists or related professions) by adopting a perspective which will try to benefit these different stakeholders. This plan aims to contribute to a common Cypriot identity through archaeology and heritage.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersIn Theodoropoulou-Polychroniadis, Z. & Evely, D.

OxfordThe discovery of ancient Cyprus: archaeological sponsorship from the 19th century to the present day2015 • Anastasia LeriouA fundamental aspect of archaeological research, particularly nowadays, is its funding. Sponsorship, either private or public, has significantly determined the nature and extent of archaeological practice throughout the world, on several occasions since archaeology's establishment as an academic discipline. The present paper aims at elucidating/ outlining the essentially interactive relationship between archaeological sponsorship (when, who, how) and the development of Cypriot archaeology from an infant academic field back in the 1890s to a highly advanced section of Mediterranean archaeology attracting several researchers and archaeological missions from various European countries, Canada and the United States. This is closely associated with the following factors: -the development of archaeological theory and practice resulting in the shift of attention from Greek antiquity to the archaeologies of the surrounding land and the chronological periods preceding the Classical era -the complexity/ multiformity of past Cypriot societies, which allowed plenty of space for experimentation and the application of new theories and methods -the island's turbulent political history (part of the Ottoman Empire, British colony, Republic of Cyprus, Turkish invasion of 1974) and the consequent association of Cypriot archaeology with various ethnic claims -Cyprus' geographic location between the Aegean, Egypt and the Syro-Palestinian coast, which attracted archaeologists focusing the study of the surrounding regions Emphasis will be placed on both past achievements and future prospects.Download Free PDFView PDFcumulus.mom.frTHE HELLENISATION OF CYPRUS: TRACING ITS BEGINNINGS (AN UPDATED VERSION)Anastasia LeriouDownload Free PDFView PDFArt Human Open Acc J. 2018;2(2):68–80.Vounous revisited: teaching history through a symposium and a ceramic workshop Abbreviations: SCE, Swedish Cyprus Expedition2018 • Netice YildizThis paper aims to show an alternative method to teach the history of a past culture of a historic site, where archaeological evidences came out but the discovered objects were removed somewhere else. In this particular case, Vounous, an Early and Middle Bronze Age rock-cut cemetery site on the hill-top opposite to the famous medieval abbey called Belapais, somewhere between the villages Ozanköy (Casaphani) and Chatalköy (Ayios Epiktitos), in Kyrenia region in Cyprus, which was excavated between the years 1925-1962 is revisited for the purpose of a Symposium and Workshop entitled as “International Terracotta Symposium: Lost Heritage of the Legend Mountain, so as to recall and teach the past history of the site and prepare a museum in the site at least by the replicas of the objects which are not anymore in this area and mostly in several museums all around the world. For the purpose of this revisit, several round huts built of palm tree leaves, wickers and mud-bricks so as to create working spaces for the ceramic production and displaying their products were constructed by the artists and other volunteers that lasted for several days. The author took part in this Symposium with a visual presentation that included a brief history of the excavation from the published literature as well as some views about the cultural aspects of the ancient people living in a nearby yet undiscovered area, through an analytical approach particularly to the ceramics from different aspects. Hundreds of ceramics produced during a workshop which encouraged several professional artists, amateur ceramic makers and children to learn the history on the original site and all these replicas and some original works that were inspired from the Vonous ancient ceramics are now displayed in a museum. This new approach that aimed to teach the lost heritage also brought awareness to the areas rich archaeological heritage.Download Free PDFView PDFAmerican Journal of Archaeology 112: 659-684. Cyprus at the end of the Late Bronze Age: crisis and colonization, or continuity and hybridization? 2008 • A. Bernard Knapp, Ioannis VoskosAncient cultural encounters in the Mediterranean were conditioned by everything from barter and exchange through migration and military engagement to colonization and conquest. Within the Mediterranean, island relations with overseas polities were also affected by factors such as insularity and connectivity. In this study, we reconsider earlier interpretations of cultural and social interactions on Cyprus at the end of the Late Bronze Age and beginning of the Iron Age, between ca. 1200 and 1000 B.C.E. Examining a wide range of material evidence (pottery, metalwork, ivory, architecture, coroplastic art), we revisit notions (the “colonization narrative”) of a major migration of Aegean peoples to Cyprus during that time. We argue that the material culture of 12th–11th-century B.C.E. Cyprus reflects an amalgamation of Cypriot, Aegean, and even Levantine trends and, along with new mortuary traditions, may be seen as representative of a new elite identity emerging on Cyprus at this time. Neither colonists nor conquerors, these newcomers to Cyprus—alongside indigenous Cypriots—established new social identities as a result of cultural encounters and mixings here defined as aspects of hybridization.Download Free PDFView PDF…  National Museums in Europe 1750–2010: …National museums in Cyprus: A Story of Heritage and Conflict2011 • ALEXANDRA BOUNIADownload Free PDFView PDFDress and the People of Flamoudi (Phlamoudhi) in the Bronze AgeJoanna S SmithSmith, Joanna S. 2017. “Dress and the People of Flamoudi (Phlamoudhi) in the Bronze Age” pp. 168–181 in Despina Pilides and Maria Mina eds., Four Decades of Hiatus in Archaeological Research in Cyprus: Towards Restoring the Balance.
