Duet AI in Apigee API
                    Management
Create API specifications by describing your requirements
                      in natural language in Apigee API Design Assistant, a
                      plugin integrated into
                      Cloud Code.
                      Based on the prompt,
                      Duet AI in Apigee API Management
                      automatically generates an OpenAPI specification
                      consistent with the other APIs and compliant with policies
                      in your enterprise. Additionally, it also provides
                      recommendations and autocompletes missing elements like
                      metadata and detailed descriptions.

Automated API Security
                    with ML based abuse detection
Use Advanced API Security to protect your APIs from
                      misconfigurations,
                      malicious bot attacks,
                      and critical abuses. Advanced API Security assesses
                      managed APIs regularly, surfaces API proxies that do not
                      meet security standards, and provides recommended actions
                      when issues are detected. ML-powered dashboards accurately
                      identify critical API abuses by finding patterns within
                      the large number of bot alerts, reducing the time to act
                      on important incidents.

High-performance API
                    proxies
Orchestrate and manage traffic for demanding applications
                      with unparalleled control and reliability. Apigee supports
                      styles like
                      REST,
                      gRPC,
                      SOAP,
                      and
                      GraphQL,
                      providing flexibility to implement any architecture. Using
                      Apigee, you can also proxy internal microservices managed
                      in a service mesh as REST APIs to enhance security.

Traffic management and
                    control policies
Apigee uses policies on API proxies to program API
                      behavior without writing any code. Policies provided by
                      Apigee allow you to add common functionality like
                      security, rate limiting, transformation, and mediation.
                      You can configure from a robust set of 50+ policies to
                      gain control on behavior, traffic, security, and QoS of
                      every API. You can even write custom scripts and code
                      (such as JavaScript applications) to extend API
                      functionality.

How It Works
                          Apigee provides an abstraction or facade for your
                          backend services by fronting services with API
                          proxies. Using these proxies you can control traffic
                          to your backend services with granular controls like
                          security, rate limiting, quotas, and much more.

Common Uses
Cloud-first application development
              
Use APIs to
                              build modern applications and architectures
 Build API proxies that enable
                              your applications to access data and functionality
                              from your Google Cloud back end or any system,
                              service, or application. Scale your applications
                              based on demand using load balancing for your
                              APIs. As you scale, you can unlock greater
                              business agility by decoupling your monolithic
                              application into microservices.

FAQ
APIs enable seamless communication between
                              applications, servers, and users in today's
                              tech-driven world. As their numbers grow, API
                              management has become crucial, encompassing
                              design, development, testing, deployment,
                              governance, security, monitoring, and monetization
                              within the software development life cycle.
RESTful APIs adhere to REST (Representational
                              State Transfer) architecture constraints.
                              Following these architecture constraints enables
                              APIs to offer scalability, speed, and data
                              versatility. An API of this kind accesses data by
                              using HTTP requests and is the most common type of
                              API used in modern applications today.
Apigee is Google Cloud’s fully managed API
                              management solution. Trusted by enterprises across
                              the globe, Apigee is developer-friendly and
                              provides comprehensive capabilities to support
                              diverse API architectural styles, deployment
                              environments, and use cases. Apigee also provides
                              flexible pricing options for every business to get
                              started and become successful on the platform.
Apigee currently supports REST, SOAP, GraphQL,
                              gRPC, or OpenAPI protocols.
Companies worldwide rely on application
                              programming interfaces, or APIs, to facilitate
                              digital experiences and unleash the potential
                              energy of their own data and processes. But the
                              proliferation and importance of APIs comes with a
                              risk. As a gateway to a wealth of information and
                              systems, APIs have become a favorite target for
                              hackers. Due to the prevalence of such attacks,
                              there is a need for a proactive approach to secure
                              APIs.
Apigee helps organizations stay ahead of security
                              threats by offering protection in three layers:
                            
1. Robust policies that protect every API
                              transaction from unauthorized users.
2. Advanced API security provides automated
                              controls to identify API misconfigurations,
                              malicious bot attacks, and anomalous traffic
                              patterns without overhead and alert fatigue. Web
                              application and API security based on the same
                              technology used by Google to protect its
                              public-facing services against web application
                              vulnerabilities, DDoS attacks, fraudulent bot
                              activity, and API-targeted threats. Google Cloud
                              WAAP combines three solutions (Apigee,
