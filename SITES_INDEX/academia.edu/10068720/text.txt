Unsurprisingly, this documentary evidence is silent on the form and style of horseequipment, though further clues can be gleaned from late Anglo-Saxon art, particularly manuscript illuminations, such as the Harley Psalter and the Old English Hexateuch. These indicate that horses would have been tacked-up with a bridle, (normally) a saddle and (in the later period) stirrups. Little extraneous detail is shown, though some illuminations, such as the Prudentius Psychomachia manuscript now in the British Library (fol. 31r), depict tassels (see → fringes and tassels) hanging from the harness-equipment, which may fossilise earlier artistic tradition.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersRoman horsemen against Germanic tribes. The Rhineland frontier cavalry fighting styles 31 BC - AD 256. Archaeologica Hereditas 12,  Warsaw 2018: Institute of Archaeology Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski University2018 • Gawroński Radosław A.Using the figured and archaeological evidence the author discusses the fighting styles of the Principate Rhineland Roman cavalry: the Italian horsemen used traditional Roman equipment: they rode on saddle blankets and used round shields and short stabbing swords of Mainz type variety, and used spears as a main combat weapons. The tribal auxiliary horsemen relied on Celtic or Thracian fighting techniques: they preferred long swords, javelins and spears and rode on "long-horned" saddles. They also used longer (hexagonal or oval) shields for defence. On the other hand, the troopers recruited from the lower Rhine societies used longer spears and preferred traditional Germanic extra-large hexagonal shields for hand to hand combat. All these fighting styles became obsolete with the introduction of shield wall tactics during the third century AD.Download Free PDFView PDFThe archaeological evidence for equestrianism in early Anglo-Saxon England, c.450-700 2005 • Chris FernDownload Free PDFView PDFNORFOLK ARCHAEOLOGYA SELECTION OF FINDS FROM NORFOLK RECORDED IN 2017 AND EARLIER2017 • Steven AshleyMore detailed descriptions of all objects in this selection can be found on the Portable Antiquities Scheme (PAS) database (http://www.fi nds.org), and all fi nds records are also entered into the Norfolk Historic Environment Record (HER).

The dates attributed to the metalwork allow activity on the site to be assigned to the 9th to the 11th centuries AD. Comparative evidence suggests that the metalwork may be associated with a precursor of the later medieval manorial curia of 'Hamme' (Hamsey), comprising the parish church of St Peter and the adjacent site of a medieval manorial residence. It is concluded that metal-detected finds represent a neglected source of evidence, with the potential to advance our understanding of settlement and of the regional economy of Sussex during the Mid-Late Saxon period.Download Free PDFView PDFMedieval Weapons: An Illustrated History of Their ImpactCantürk ÇelikDownload Free PDFView PDFCastles and the Anglo-Norman WorldAnglo-Norman elite objects from castle and countryside2016 • Steven AshleyIn the period from the Conquest until c.1200 there is a relative lack of finds of dress accessories and personal possessions in comparison with preceding and succeeding centuries. Those finds there are, a range of objects from castle, countryside, manor and hall, reflect the status, preoccupations and pleasures of the new ruling elite. Some of these objects bear decorative motifs employing proto-armorial or armorial devices and also demonstrate influences from Central Asia and the East. A number of the finds under consideration were discovered in dated contexts during the excavation of castles and other high-status sites, and these assemblages exhibit a considerable degree of consistency and indeed predictability in their composition. However, most recently recorded finds come from metal-detecting. This is the result, in Norfolk at least, of the establishment of a good working relationship with metal detectorists which has continued over the last four decades. This has enhanced the range of finds for the period in terms of form and decoration without changing the overall picture of relative paucity of Anglo-Norman material, in which little is ascribable to the lower orders during this time. Finds from castle excavations and more recently discovered material from the countryside, in particular examples from Norfolk, are considered here and grouped thematically.Download Free PDFView PDFThe Horse and the Norse: Reconstructing the Equine in Viking Iceland (MLitt Dissertation)Kristina D StelterBy analyzing the historical texts and the archaeological record, the horse’s role in Icelandic Viking society was investigated. Studying horses in order to understand Icelandic Vikings is necessary due to the extraordinary abundance of faunal, artifactual, and textual remains pertaining to the animal – an abundance that is unique within the Norse expansion. Through the analysis and discussion of the available literature and archaeological evidence, it was determined that the horse was vital to maintaining Icelandic society – providing the crucial transport that ships could not offer on the island. Icelandic Vikings even adapted their way of life to accommodate and maintain their large herds – a feat that the island’s ecosystem could not sustain without sacrifice from its settlers. Through this adaptation and dedication to sustain their horse herds the Vikings integrated the horse so fully into their society that the animal can be seen in the island’s entertainment, ritual, religion, myth, and burial practices. With this evidence, a reconstruction of the horse and its tack was also completed, revealing gaps in the archaeological knowledge concerning the Vikings and their steeds.Download Free PDFView PDFA Preliminary Study of 17th- and 18th-Century Leather Ornaments from MarylandSara Rivers CofieldLeather ornaments represent an underutilized artifact type that often suffers from misidentification during artifact cataloging and neglect during artifact analysis. This paper summarizes efforts to compile a large sample of leather ornaments from sites all over Maryland on the Diagnostic Artifacts in Maryland webpage so that they will be available for comparative study. Research conducted as the project progressed makes it evident that stylistic changes in leather ornaments have temporal significance, and there are many possible avenues of investigation that might allow the ornaments to make a more robust contribution to site analysis.Download Free PDFView PDF2008: MALE IDENTITY IN LATE NEOLITHIC/EARLY BRONZE AGE EUROPE, 2800–2300 BCJakob WestermannDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
