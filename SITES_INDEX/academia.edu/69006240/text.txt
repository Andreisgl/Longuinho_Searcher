The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between systemic racism generally, and residential segregation in particular, and racial/ethnic disparities in deaths due to COVID-19. Methods: To assess racial disparities in COVID-19 and systemic racism in US states, we calculated descriptive statistics and bivariate Pearson correlations. Using data on deaths through December 2020, we developed a weighted logistic mixed model to assess whether state-level systemic racism generally and residential segregation, in particular, predicted the probability of COVID-19 deaths among Americans, con­sidering key sociodemographic factors. Results: Residential segregation is a stronger predictor of COVID-19 deaths among Black Americans, as compared to systemic racism more generally. Looking at the interac­tion between residential segregation and COVID-19 death rates by race, residential segregation is associated with negative outcomes for Black and White Americans, but disproportionately impacts Black state residents (P<.001), who have 2.14 times higher odds of dying from COVID-19 when residential segregation is increased. Conclusion: To understand and address disparities in infectious disease, researchers and public health practitioners should ac­knowledge how different forms of systemic racism shape health outcomes in the United States. More attention should be given to the mechanisms by which infectious disease pandemics exacerbate health disparities in areas of high residential segregation and should inform more targeted health poli­cies. Such policy changes stand to make all American communities more resilient in the face of new and emerging infec­tious diseases.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersJournal of Racial and Ethnic Health DisparitiesDo Black Lives Matter in the American Public’s Mitigation Responses to the COVID-19 Pandemic? An Analysis of Mask Wearing and Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Deaths from COVID-192021 • Berkeley FranzMask wearing has varied considerably throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and has been most often associated with political affiliation and specific health beliefs. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between mask usage, neighborhood racial segregation, and racial disparities in COVID-19 deaths. We used linear regression to assess whether the racial/ethnic composition of deaths and residential segregation predicted Americans’ decisions to wear masks in July 2020. After controlling for mask mandates, mask usage increased when White death rates relative to Black and Hispanic rates increased. Mask wearing may be shaped by an insensitivity to Black and Hispanic deaths and a corresponding unwillingness to engage in health-protective behaviors. The broader history of systemic racism and residential segregation may also explain why white Americans do not wear masks or perceive themselves to be at risk when communities of color are disproportionately affected by COVID-19.Download Free PDFView PDFInternational Journal of Environmental Research and Public HealthChanging the Narrative: Structural Barriers and Racial and Ethnic Inequities in COVID-19 VaccinationMarcelin JosephThe COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected racial and ethnic minority groups in the United States. Although a promising solution of the COVID-19 vaccination offers hope, disparities in access again threaten the health of these communities. Various explanations have arisen for the cause of disparate vaccination rates among racial and ethnic minorities, including discussion of vaccine hesitancy. Conversely, the role of vaccine accessibility rooted in structural racism as a driver in these disparities should be further explored. This paper discusses the impact of structural barriers on racial and ethnic disparities in COVID-19 vaccine uptake. We also recommend public health, health system, and community-engaged approaches to reduce racial disparities in COVID-19 disease and mortality.Download Free PDFView PDFNevada Journal of Public HealthCOVID-19 and Communities of Color: Understanding the Impact of Racism on Public Health2021 • Daryl O TraylorAs the COVID-19 pandemic spread across the U.S., communities of color shared an uneven burden of the disease. The ability to understand from a public health perspective, the increase and devastating health effects and morbidity consequences due to COVID-19 is alarming, but not unexpected based upon structural racism. In light of the recent declarations of racism as a public health crisis, the push to address the situations that COVID-19 has brought to bear is an imperative. This article defines the levels of racism that exist, distinguishing between intrapersonal, interpersonal, institutional, and structural racism. Redlining in terms of the provision of home loans is used as an example of structural racism and its impact on COVID-19 and communities of color, even here in Nevada. With this understanding, the article closes with potential solutions in the areas of policy, health care and COVID-19, public health, as well as future research opportunities. While the solutions are not all encompassing, it does provide a starting point for dialogue, planning, and implementation in which to address the multitude of health disparities and health inequities that have always existed but systematically ignored either intentionally or unintentionally. Regardless of intentions, it took a pandemic to be the moving force and catalyst for enlightenment as it relates to the determinants of health and racism within communities of color.Download Free PDFView PDFCities & HealthStructurally vulnerable neighbourhood environments and racial/ethnic COVID-19 inequitiesRachel L BerkowitzDownload Free PDFView PDFRacial disparities in COVID-19 mortality across Michigan, United StatesJim CollinsBlack populations in the US are disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, but the increased mortality burden after accounting for health and demographic characteristics is not well understood. We evaluated COVID-19 mortality in Michigan using individual-level death certificate and surveillance data from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services from March 16 to October 26, 2020. Among the 6,065 COVID-19-related deaths, Black individuals experienced 3.6 times the mortality rate as White individuals. Black individuals under 65 years without comorbidities had a mortality rate 12.6 times that of their White counterparts. After accounting for age, sex, and comorbidities, we found that Black individuals in all strata are at higher risk of COVID-19 mortality than their White peers. We demonstrate that inequities in mortality are driven by ongoing systemic racism, as opposed to comorbidity burden or older age, and further highlight how underlying disparities across th...Download Free PDFView PDFEthnicity & DiseaseLooking Back to Leap Forward: A Framework for Operationalizing the Structural Racism Construct in Minority and Immigrant Health ResearchRae MartinezRacism is now widely recognized as a fundamental cause of health inequali­ties in the United States. As such, health scholars have rightly turned their attention toward examining the role of struc­tural racism in fostering morbidity and mortality. However, to date, much of the empirical structural racism-health dispari­ties literature limits the operationalization of structural racism to a single domain or orients the construct around a White/ Black racial frame. This operationaliza­tion approach is incomprehensive and overlooks the heterogeneity of historical and lived experiences among other racial and ethnic groups.To address this gap, we present a theoreti­cally grounded framework that illumi­nates core mutually reinforcing domains of structural racism that have stratified opportunities for health in the United States. We catalog instances of structural discrimination that were particularly con­straining (or advantageous) to the health of racial and ethnic groups from the late 1...Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of Health Politics, Policy and LawRacism and the Political Economy of COVID-19: Will We Continue to Resurrect the Past?Zinzi BaileyCOVID-19 is not spreading over a level playing field; structural racism is embedded within the fabric of American culture, infrastructure investments, and public policy and fundamentally drives inequities. The same racism that has driven the systematic dismantling of the American social safety net has also created the policy recipe for American structural vulnerability to the impacts of this and other pandemics. The Bronx provides an important case study for investigating the historical roots of structural inequities showcased by this pandemic; current lived experiences of Bronx residents are rooted in the racialized dismantling of New York City&#39;s public infrastructure and systematic disinvestment. The story of the Bronx is repeating itself, only this time with a novel virus. To address the root causes of inequities in cases and deaths due to COVID-19, we need to focus not just on restarting the economy but also on reimagining the economy, divesting of systems rooted in racism, ...Download Free PDFView PDFThe Journals of Gerontology: Series BThe Color of COVID-19: Structural Racism and the Disproportionate Impact of the Pandemic on Older Black and Latinx Adults2020 • Patricia HomanObjectives The aim of this evidence-based theoretically informed article was to provide an overview of how and why the COVID-19 outbreak is particularly detrimental for the health of older Black and Latinx adults. Methods We draw upon current events, academic literature, and numerous data sources to illustrate how biopsychosocial factors place older adults at higher risk for COVID-19 relative to younger adults, and how structural racism magnifies these risks for black and Latinx adults across the life course. Results We identify 3 proximate mechanisms through which structural racism operates as a fundamental cause of racial/ethnic inequalities in COVID-19 burden among older adults: (a) risk of exposure, (b) weathering processes, and (c) health care access and quality. Discussion While the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented crisis, the racial/ethnic health inequalities among older adults it has exposed are longstanding and deeply rooted in structural racism within American...Download Free PDFView PDFBMC Public HealthStructural racism and COVID-19 response: higher risk of exposure drives disparate COVID-19 deaths among Black and Hispanic/Latinx residents of Illinois, USA2022 • Tobias HoldenBackground Structural racism has driven and continues to drive policies that create the social, economic, and community factors resulting in residential segregation, lack of access to adequate healthcare, and lack of employment opportunities that would allow economic mobility. This results in overall poorer population health for minoritized people. In 2020, Black and Hispanic/Latinx communities throughout the United States, including the state of Illinois, experienced disproportionately high rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths. Public health officials in Illinois implemented targeted programs at state and local levels to increase intervention access and reduce disparities. Methods To quantify how disparities in COVID outcomes evolved through the epidemic, data on SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests, COVID-19 cases, and COVID-19 deaths were obtained from the Illinois National Electronic Disease Surveillance System for the period from March 1 to December 31, 2020.
