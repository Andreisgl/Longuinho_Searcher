Cape Town, South Africa 30 August 2016___________________________________________________________________________ Well log interpretation is one of the prime sources of information for deep lithology in drilling research. Applications of downhole logs are well developed in the petroleum industry. As a result, log respo nses in sedimentary rocks are well known; even though, this is not the case for crystalline rocks [1]. Because of the complex geological features of the crystalline rocks, more complex nonlinear functi onal be haviors exist for well log interpretation purposes. Moreover, up to now, there is no systematic formulated interpretation/classification methods available for crystalline rocks [2] in geophysics; thus posing challenges in accurate identification of log curve for this purpose. Motived by the success of statistical methods to solve different problems in geophysics, thi s study wi ll explore the applicability of using Cross Plot and Factor Analysis to recognize metamorphi c rocks type s using geochemical log data. These methods are calibrated on Chinese Continental Scientific Drilling Main Hole (CCSD-MH) data. The CCSD-MH project was one of the largest and most expensive scientific research projects in geosciences ever undertaken in China [3]. The CCSD-MH is located in the southe rn part of Donghai County, in the Sulu Ultrahigh pressure metamorphic belt of Eastern China (Figure 1). After 3 years of drilling through UHPM, a final depth of 5158 m was reached in 2005. It is the deepest well drilled into the extremely hard crystalline rocks [3]. The logging engineering employed more than 20 types of well logging tools and use d advanced ECLIPS5700 image logging system to obtain a variety of geophysical and geochemical logging data. Therefore the CCSD project database offers a unique opportunity to study log responses in relation to rock composition for metamorphic rocks. Also of interest in this research will be the comparison of geochemical logs analysis results through statistical methods to those obtained by geophysical logs in order to determine if the geochemical logs evaluati on has any advantages over geophysical logs evaluation in crystalline rocks interpretation. These statistical methods can be a very advantageous tool in facilitating the task of geophysicists in the framework of research drillings in continental crust.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersCapability of self-organizing map neural network in geophysical log data classification: Case study from the CCSD-MHYao  Yevenyo Ziggah (PhD)Well log interpretation is one of the prime sources of information for deep lithology in drilling research. Because of the complex geological features of the crystalline metamorphic rocks, more complex nonlinear functional behaviors exist for well log interpretation purposes. Hence, establishing a prediction technology that can accurately interpret/classify well log data in terms of lithology is of major significance. This study, for the first time, explores the application of self-organizing map neural network (SOM) in the classification of metamorphic rocks from Chinese Continental Scientific Drilling Main Hole (CCSD-MH) log data. For this purpose, a total of 33,326 data points derived from resistivity, P-wave velocity, bulk density, photoelectric absorption capture cross section, gamma ray, potassium content and neutron logs were used as an input pattern to a SOM to classify lithology in five categories: orthogneiss, paragneiss, eclogite, amphibolite and ultramafic rocks. Comparison of SOM results to those of feed-forward neural network (FFNN) was also carried out. The cross-validation method was used to investigate the robustness of the two neural networks in terms of classification accuracy in the context of lithology clustering tasks by sampling rotation. Statistical tests such as student paired samples t-test was carried out to guide in classification decision of the CCSD-MH data. The results of this study have proven that SOM appears to be comparable to FFNN in classifying lithology using geophysical log data from crystalline rocks. This proposed SOM approach can serve as practical alternative technology to be used in drilling research.Download Free PDFView PDFChapter in Book  By Springer Nature: Petrogenesis and Exploration of the Earth InteriorKonaté2019_Chapter_MineralogyRecognitionFromIn-Si-2.pdf2019 • Nasir  KhanDownload Free PDFView PDFTectonophysicsDeep root of a continent–continent collision belt: Evidence from the Chinese Continental Scientific Drilling (CCSD) deep borehole in the Sulu ultrahigh-pressure (HP–UHP) metamorphic terrane, China2009 • Shaocheng JiDownload Free PDFView PDFUse of spectral gamma ray as a lithology guide for fault rocks: A case study from the Wenchuan Earthquake Fault Scientific Drilling project Borehole 4 (WFSD-4)Nasir  KhanDownload Free PDFView PDFTectonophysicsDrilling deep into the ultrahigh pressure (UHP) metamorphic terrane2009 • Zhiqin  XuDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Geophysical ResearchSuperdeep vertical seismic profiling at the KTB deep drill hole (Germany): Seismic close-up view of a major thrust zone down to 8.5 km depth2004 • T.

July 7-10Surface soil survey in an archaeological context: the Kazanlak Geoscience Project, BulgariaRobbi Bishop-TaylorWhile the interdisciplinary field of geoarcheology now often involves petrological surveys at archeological sites, the Kazanlak Geoscience Project aimed to go back to the geomorphology-based beginnings of the field to demonstrate how a simple soil survey could be beneficial to an archeological project. During the 2011 autumn season of the Tundzha Regional Archaeology Project (TRAP), a small geoscience team conducted such a soil survey across the Kazanlak valley in central Bulgaria. Sample sites were randomly selected using stratified systematic random sampling (SSRS), and 155 soil samples were collected. The soil was tested for organic matter content, carbonate content, texture and coarse fraction, with the results analysed and interpolated in a GIS to determine spatial patterns in each of these soil properties within the study area. The data were then used in combination with topographic and land cover datasets to produce a quantitative model of soil erosion potential for the region, which predicted erosion rates of up to 895 t/ha/yr or 70 mm/yr. These findings have various potential applications, such as past landscape reconstructions or in determining spatial relationships between soil properties, landscape stability and surface distribution of archeological artefacts.Download Free PDFView PDFAbstract Book_Final  VOLUME_Dar es Salaam_2014.pdfAmbili PremeshDownload Free PDFView PDFTecnocienciaEVALUATING THE PERFORMANCE OF DIFFERENT GEOPHYSICAL METHODS FOR GROUNDWATER PROSPECTING IN ESPIRITO SANTO BASIN -SOUTHEAST BRAZIL2007 • Abel Carrasquilla, Emin U UlugergerliFour geophysical techniques were used in different parts of Espirito Santo Basin (Southeast Brazil), in both sedimentary (Aracruz District) and crystalline (Rio Bananal and Ibiraçu Districts) kind of terrains. The main goal of the survey was to evaluate the performance of these geophysical methods for groundwater prospecting in such kinds of geology. Fieldworks were performed through several soundings, using time domain electromagnetic (TDEM), while surface profiles were obtained using Direct Current Resistivity (DCRE) and frequency domain electromagnetic (FDEM). On the other hand, geophysical well logging method (WL) was used through temperature, natural gamma ray, spontaneous potential and normal/lateral resistivity logs. Thus, with the utilized geophysical methods we were able to separate shaly and sandy geological formations, as well as, the presence of faults or fractures in the crystalline rocks, which are important geological structures in the definition of aquifers within different igneous or sedimentary areas of this basin. The recognition of these environments permitted us to locate the best places to drill wells and to put correctly the casings, obtaining, in this form, freshwater resources for human consumption.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
