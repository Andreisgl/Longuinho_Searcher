The main aim of the present study is to recommend a  suitable  site  for  soil  and  water  conservation  in Anjani  and  Jhiri  river  basin,  Northern  Maharashtra,  India. The study area is geologically covered by Deccan trap basalts of the Cretaceous to the lower Eocene age, and some part is covered by thick alluvium of the Quaternary age. Drainage map of the study area reveals two drainage patterns including dendritic and sub dendritic patterns, indicating that the uniform lithology of the basaltic landforms has uniform  resistance  to  erosion.  This  condition  has  caused  the Anjani  and  Jhiri  River  get  little  recharge  from  the rainwater  and  the  surface  drainage  flows  during  only  monsoon  season  and  latter  becomes  dry. Therefore,  water conservation is a prime need for minimize water scarcity problems in the study area. In the present study, landscape information, such as longitudinal profile and hypsometric integral, has been analysed. The longitudinal profile reveals the presence of nick points at three locations in Anjani river and two locations in Jhiri river. The nick points indicate that the rapids are formed due to different erosion, relief and presence of lineament (Joint).The hypsometric integral values for the Anjani and Jhiri river are 0.52 and 0.51, respectively. The present research illustrates that both basins fall under equilibrium stage and are in a mature phase of development.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The area covered during present investigation is drained by the streams which originate in theSahyadri ranges of the Western Ghats and follow short tumultuous courses. Majority of streams follow East - West course,some follow NW - SE and NE - SW courses. Most of the streams are characterised by straight segments with acute angleturns, indicative of structural control. This structural control has given rise to drainage anomalies. Most of the streams intheir upper reaches exhibit the presence of rapids, which occur, generally at elevations of 60 - 70m amsl. Their height rangesfrom 1m to 15m. From topographic sheets and LANDSAT - I imageries inferred that the majority of the streams have beencontrolled by lineaments. Satellite imagery reveals that major streams like Kajavi have been controlled by NW - SE lineament,while river Shastri has been controlled by NE - SW lineament. From the hypsometric values it is inferred that the higher orderstreams show Monadnock phase, whereas, the hypsometric values indicate maturity stage. It can be said that the area underinvestigation indicates Monadnock phase of aeration which represents the residual hills.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Groundwater quality of study area has been deteriorated predominantly due to over exploration and anthropogenic activities.Geochemistry of groundwater shows that the Ca > Mg > Na > K and HCO3 > Cl > SO4 > CO32- trend. Most of the groundwater samples are observed as Ca-HCO3 Type. Groundwater samples of the study area show higher concentration of TDS (>1000 ppm), Cl (>1000 ppm), NO3 (>45 ppm), K (> 10 ppm), Ca (>200 ppm), HCO3 (> 600 ppm) and B (<1 ppm). Irrigation water quality has been inadequate-ly affected by salinity hazards and residual soluble carbonate (RSC).Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
