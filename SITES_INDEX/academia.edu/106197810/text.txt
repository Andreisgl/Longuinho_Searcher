The sense of guilt is indeed a trace that leads deep into the individual’s mental life, into his childhood life, and into the prehistory of culture and religion. In this book this trace is followed and thus Freud’s thought on the sense of guilt as a central issue in his work is analyzed, from the earliest studies on the moral and “guilty” characters of the hysterics, via the later complex differentiations in the concept of the sense of guilt, unto the analyses of civilization’s discontents and Jewish sense of guilt. The sense of guilt is a key issue in Freudian psychoanalysis, not only in relation to other key concepts in psychoanalytic theory, but also in relation to debates with others, such as Carl Gustav Jung or Melanie Klein, Freud was engaged in.Download Free PDFView PDFThe Demonization of IsraelThe Demonization of Israel.

Cornell University Press, 1993, Ithaca. David YT"A little more than kin, and less than kind": Hamlet's first line in the play diagnoses in advance the relationship between Shakespeare and psychoanalysis as a bad pun that renders discursive filiations overdetermined and unchaste, "too much in the sun." It is not so much that Shakespeare and psychoanalysis are of different kinds—tragedy versus theory—but rather that their very proximity renders them "less than kind," prone to sibling rivalry and other children's games, from "playing doctor" to the Hegelian "struggle for pure prestige." If the first game describes the sexual research of psychoanalysis as an infantile theory applied to literature, the latter marks the "mirror up to philosophy" in which the structuralist and poststructuralist Shakespeares fruitlessly multiply.Download Free PDFView PDFPortrait of the Postmodern Artist as Hysteric2011 • Dinah E Holtzman"Portrait of the Postmodern Artist as Hysteric" explores the art of crossover celebrity artists Cindy Sherman, Matthew Barney, and Kara Walker. I posit that their creation of diegetic alter egos demonstrates how the subjective splitting once attributed to hysteria has become a postmodern norm. This mainstreaming of hysteria arose in the wake of the demystification of the modernist notion of the sovereign subject as well as the supplantation of reality with simulacral images. These two developments have resulted in a cultural shift characterized by the notion that subjectivity is a performance of the self as a series of simulacral images devoid of any original referent. Though hysteria is widely perceived to be an antiquated relic of the nineteenth-century fin-de-siècle, I argue that the mimetic condition epitomizes postmodern subjective shifts. Identity, like the ostensibly obsolete malady, is a performance of subjective lack projected upon the surface of the body. This void manifests as dissociative split selves produced by way of hysterical identifications in which the self is (con)fused with an other. As with hysterics, Walker, Barney, and Sherman pose themselves to viewers as a question. By implication, they ask audiences to diagnose or fix their protean symptoms and identities. Thus, viewers, like clinicians, are hystericized in the process of attempting to convert performative displays of discordant and ahistorical symptoms into coherent narratives and stable identities. These artists’ alter egos compel us to recognize ourselves as similarly fragmented and mimetic subjects. In the postmodern era, binaristic conceptions of race, gender, and sexuality have become more fluid. This subjective mutability is the result of widespread recognition that identities are performative. Presenting oneself as raced and gendered in accordance with established codes reifies the ideologies that motivated the performances in the first place. While postmodernism has seen the efflorescence of posts – post-racial, post-feminist, post-human – we are hardly free of the instinct to categorize others. Thus, we live in an intriguing moment in which identities are seen as fluid and evolving yet we cannot seem to relinquish the notions of racial and sexual difference. However, these artists suggest that we are moving toward the possibility of abolishing such divisive identity categorical criteria and are beginning to formulate alternative means of defining ourselves in relation to others.Download Free PDFView PDFFreud: Conflict and Culture: Essays on His Life, Work,  …Oedipus Politicus: Freud's Paradigm of Social Relations2000 • Jose BrunnerDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of War & Culture StudiesThe veteran's wounded body before the mirror: the dialectic of wholeness and disintegration in Andre Makine's prose2008 • helena duffyAbstract A central point of historical reference in the writing of contemporary Russian-born French author, Andre Makine, namely the Second World War, which redrew the map of Europe and redressed the balance of power in world politics, both to the advantage of the Soviet Union, allows this highly successful novelist to remind his western readers of Russia&#39;s former military might and to re-posit the Soviet regime generally seen as a perpetrator of crimes against both other nations and the Russian people as victim. The soldier&#39;s wounded body emerges as concrete proof of the Soviet Union&#39;s sacrifice in the struggle against fascism and as metaphor for the empire&#39;s disintegration as a consequence of Russia&#39;s opening to western capital and values. Read first from a Foucauldian and then from a Lacanian perspective, the samovar (a soldier who has lost all his limbs) and other, less drastic, forms of wounding will be interpreted as surfaces painfully inscribed and even ruined by language, culture and history, and as an expression of the narrator&#39;s longing for the morselized body&#39;s fusion with the mother that precedes the mirror stage in the infant&#39;s development. Reflected in Makine&#39;s neo-realistic prose, the dismembered body becomes, paradoxically like the samovar in the original sense of the word a figure of wholeness with the potential to counter post-Soviet despondency.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
