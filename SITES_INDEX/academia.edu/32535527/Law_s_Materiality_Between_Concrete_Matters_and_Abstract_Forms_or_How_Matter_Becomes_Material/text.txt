Although it is appealing to bring into legal scholarship the insights afforded by different kinds of new materialisms as, for instance, advanced by Jane and , it is by no means clear what thinking about law in these highly heterogeneous new materialist ways would entail. 1 One strand of legal scholarship's 'new' material turn may be tempted to treat law as a material culture so that the analytical focus falls on 'legal' objects. Following the footsteps of the highly popular book The History of the World in 100 Objects by Neil MacGregor (2012) might be an interesting pedagogical exercise for making law seem less abstract and removed from the 'real' tactile world. But it would be helpful to pose the ontological question...See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersLaw Text CultureIntroduction to Special Issue on 'Legal Materiality'2019 • Hyo Yoon KangOver the last decade there has been an increased interest in materiality within legal scholarship, as well as in related disciplines that study law and its practices. Much of it has accounted for the concrete and complex manifestations of law through various materials: from formats of inscription to other mediated devices, such as files and images, to bodies and spaces upon and through which law acts. Yet the terms ‘matter’, ‘materials’ and ‘materiality’ are employed in divergent ways across different works, and often without clear distinctions or theoretical delineations. This special issue begins from proposing a differentiated understanding of these terms in relation to law and legal scholarship, and embeds them in a broader conception of legality, unpacking their premises and implications.Download Free PDFView PDFOxford Handbook of Law and Humanities, forthcomingLegal Materiality2019 • Hyo Yoon Kang(Final copyedited version) This chapter presents legal materiality as a distinct approach within law and humanities scholarship. Legal materiality is concerned with the conditions of possibility in and through which law arises, rather than taking law’s materiality to be self-evident, as when it is regarded as a form of material culture or when objects are taken as symbols of law. It distinguishes between matters and materials: if matters are problematizations or ‘matters of concern’ to law, materials are the attributes or properties that are enlisted in acts of interpretation. Rather than addressing materials as inert physical elements that are acted upon by law, legal materiality is concerned with how materials come to matter by being engaged in the production of legal meaning through interpretive and representational practices. Section 2.2 situates this approach in relation to a broader inheritance of materialism and materiality in the Western tradition. It considers different understandings of “materialism,” such as “new materialisms” and historical materialism, that inform but also diverge from legal materiality. Section 2.3 engages with different uses of “materiality” in recent legal scholarship, followed by a detailed discussion of its meaning in two works of legal theory that have sought to articulate a conception of legal materiality. The concluding section discusses the potentials of this approach for law and humanities scholarship to understand how materials are directly implicated in the making of legal difference rather than serving solely as law’s objects.

First I present the immateriality of the abstract concepts that make up this composite term: 'climate' and 'justice'. Yet the placing the words adjacent to one another seems to mobilise them into a novel composite vehicle of legal action. I trace how the idea of 'climate justice' hovers as an elusive idea around the concrete particularities of what can be known about 'climate' specifically in relation to 'justice'. These questions are probed in the setting and context of the Philippine Human Rights Commission's 2018 Inquiry into the Carbon Majors' (Chevron, Exxon, Shell, BP etc.) violation of human rights. The aim here is mainly diagnostic: rather than taking legal doctrines of environmental or international human rights law as analytical materials, I use a legal materialist approach in order to try to make sense of what is concretely happening when an issue of a planetary scale of complexity is addressed and represented in a medium-sized moot court room. It helps to bring into vision the specific modes by which formats, places and media are enlisted as constitutive elements in the becoming and stabilisation of the emerging legal matter of climate justice. My analysis depicts law acting as the medium for upscaling (an idea of human justice) and downscaling (of climate science) different knowledges into other frameworks of reality than their original ones: to that of the human narrative scale.Download Free PDFView PDFScience Inside Law. The Making of a New Patent Class in the International Patent ClassificationHyo Yoon KangRecent studies of patents have argued that the very materiality and techniques of legal media, such as the written patent document, are vital for the legal construction of a patentable invention. Developing the centrality placed on patent documents further, it becomes important to understand how they are ordered and mobilised. The patent classification is the answer to the necessity to make the virtual nature of textual claims practicable, by linking written inscription to bureaucracy. Here, the epistemological organisation of documents overlaps with the grid of patent administration. How are scientific inventions represented in such a process? Examining the process of creating a new patent category within the International Patent Classification (IPC), it becomes clear that disagreements about the substance of the novel inventive subject matter were resolved through computer simulations of patent documents in draft classifications. The practical needs of patent examiners were the most important concerns in the making of a new category. Such a lack of epistemological mediation between the scientific and legal identities of an invention depicts a legal understanding that science is already inside patent law. From an internal legal perspective, the self-referential making of the new patent class may make practical sense, however starts to become problematic from a technological and scientific standpoint as the remit of the patent classification also affects other social contexts and practices.Download Free PDFView PDFLaw, Culture and Humanities"Is There (Should There Be) a Law and Humanities Canon?"2020 • Hyo Yoon KangThis commentary considers the question of whether there is, or should be, a law and humanities canon by exploring the identity and value of the field and querying the concept of canon itself as an authoritative cultural technique of intellectual and social reproduction. I argue that the common trait which binds works in the field of law and humanities together is the connective 'and', which is inimical to the concept of a canon. Thinking with Barbara Hernstein Smith's work on value and evaluation, Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht's criticism of canons and classics, and Frantz Fanon's understanding of personal universality, I show that the notion of an inclusive or 'global' canon is an oxymoron and argue that it ought to be resisted.

It starts from the premise that the diversity of and shifts in legal inscriptive practices and media, which often appear as legalistic and minute bureaucratic technicalities, frame and inform the ways in which inventions are understood as epistemic, legal, and cultural artefacts. Taking patent law’s representational techniques as the objects of inquiry requires attention to the specificities of its language and form, which have been predominantly based on textual semiotic logic and formats. The writings in patent documents are not only technical but utmost legal. They underlie specific word choices, style and syntax. Moreover, patent writing is bound and modulated by the relationship of categories within the particular form of the patent document itself. How, if at all, does the meaning of invention - that is, the interpretation of both the inscribed legal concept and its original knowledge practice in science and technology – change with the latest shift in law’s media which dissociates words into digital codes, documents into electronic signs? The figures in this essay illustrate the material change in the way patents are handled: they are electronic pictures or data. I outline practices of patent document’s digitization and explore their implication on the recognition of the inventive object by drawing on studies conducted at the intersection of intellectual property law and history of sciences. The insights are read together with studies of digital material cultures in the humanities and mathematics. In the latter body of scholarship, I have been informed particularly by Matthew Kirschenbaum’s work on textuality and forensic materiality, Johanna Drucker’s work on material semiotics and her concept of diagrammatic writing, as well as Brian Rotman’s analysis of digital computing in relation to semiotics of alphabetic and numeral inscriptions. The insertion of the word ‘ghost’ in the article title is inspired and borrowed from Rotman’s account of distributed human subject formation. The difference here is that the subject who is constituted by digital signs is law. Taken together, these readings identify and raise questions about the ontological changes brought about by the digitization of patents as a legal form in terms of their visibility (relating to search, retrieval and storage), legibility (relating to sensorial perception and experience, as well as reader’s interpretation), and instrumentality (relating to questions about ease of navigation, manoeuvrability, comparison, and translation). These questions are not only relevant not only from the viewpoint of science-law translation and knowledge transmission, but for the overall justification and legitimacy of patent system as whole in its self-understanding as an archive and evolving account of past inventions.Download Free PDFView PDFLaw Text Culture‘The beauty… is that it speaks for itself’: geospatial materials as evidentiary matters2020 • Sara Kendall, Kamari Maxine ClarkeAs part of a special issue on the theme of 'legal materiality', this essay takes up the incorporation of geospatial materials into international criminal law and its institutional locations, focusing on the Hague-based International Criminal Court (ICC). We consider how geospatial materials such as satellite imagery are conscripted as legal materials for international criminal trials, and how these relatively novel forms of evidence require interventions of technical knowledge through expert witness testimony. The assemblage of satellite imagery, expert testimony, and submitted reports are subjected to what we call ‘juridical mediation’ – the vetting of materials through interpretive processes that bring them into a relationship with textual forms, such as statutory principles and the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. What appears on the other side of this mediated process is a complex and composite relationship between textual, technological, and hermeneutic forms, troubling the claim that geospatial material ‘speaks for itself’.Download Free PDFView PDFBook Review: AlainPottage and BradSherman, Figures of Invention: A History of Modern Patent Law2012 • Hyo Yoon KangDownload Free PDFView PDFLaw and CritiqueAn Exploration into Law and Narratives: The Case of Intellectual Property Law of Biotechnology2006 • Hyo Yoon KangThis essay explores the possibility of applying narrative analysis as a tool for the socio-cultural study of law. Narrative is understood to be both a form of representation of reality, as well as a starting point into the enquiry about the nature of reality itself. Consequently, an analysis of legal narratives could help to assess law’s impact on our understanding of social reality and of ourselves. The narrative context, which is examined for its plot and metaphors, is the intellectual property law of human biotechnology. The legal representation of techno-scientific knowledge in intellectual property law is contrasted against other conceptions of science, especially with the ones that are put forward by scholars in science and technology studies and anthropology. It is argued that the present legal narrative of human biotechnology and intellectual property not only lacks sufficient understanding of the scientific knowledge-making process but also, importantly, that it is in need of a self-reflexive understanding of its own practice. At the end, the possibility of changing the present legal narrative will be probed with the help of different narrative theories of the self and of representation, which have been advanced by White, Taylor and MacIntyre.Download Free PDFView PDFLaw and the Senses: SMELLLaw’s Stench: Material Relations and Law, forthcoming2020 • Zachary ReynaDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
