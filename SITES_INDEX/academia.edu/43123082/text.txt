Women have even acted as suicide bombers in Bangladesh, which some scholars observe as a new trend of militancy in the country. Against this backdrop, this article uncovers some key drivers of female radicalisation in Bangladesh. It argues that the so-called Islamist model of obedience to one’s husband, ideological conviction, Muslim victimhood narratives and crises in life, among others, drive women towards radicalisation in Bangladesh.Download Free PDFView PDFISD ReportCoronaJihad: COVID-19, Misinformation, and Anti-Muslim Violence in India2020 • Amarnath AmarasingamOn March 25th, India imposed one of the largest lockdowns in history, confining its 1.3 billion citizens for over a month to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). By the end of the first week of the lockdown, starting March 29th reports started to emerge that there was a common link among a large number of the new cases detected in different parts of the country: many had attended a large religious gathering of Muslims in Delhi. In no time, Hindu nationalist groups began to see the virus not as an entity spreading organically throughout India, but as a sinister plot by Indian Muslims to purposefully infect the population. This report tracks anti-Muslim rhetoric and violence in India related to COVID-19, as well as the ongoing impact on social cohesion in the country.Download Free PDFView PDFCSIS CommentariesStructural Barriers: COVID-19 and Lockdown Lessons from India2020 • Evan A LaksmanaDownload Free PDFView PDFRiots abroad: Gujarat, Diaspora, and the Immigrant PressNishaant ChoksiThis thesis paper examines the reactions of Indian-American press in light of the 2002 pogrom against the Muslim minority in the western Indian state of Gujarat. Gujarat has a large diaspora in the United States and in many ways this diaspora was implicated in the violence. The thesis argues that the reactions to the violence in the immigrant English language press, both among right-wing and liberal Hindus as well as among South Asian Muslims were filtered through discourses of American multiculturalism and imagined 'homelands' rather than engaging with the lived realities of India. The immigrant Gujarati-language press on the other hand presented a much more nuanced and intimate reaction, and thus offered a more compelling condemnation of the violence. The thesis shows how American multiculturalism is implicated in the growth of right-wing violence in South Asia, and ends with a reflection on the impact of these ideologies on second-generation Indian-American youth.Download Free PDFView PDFapru.comThe Politics of Identity among Diasporic Communities along the Pacific Rim: Indians in the United States and Pakistanis in AustraliaAhmar  MahboobDownload Free PDFView PDFInterventions: International Journal of Postcolonial StudiesHindu Nation and its Queers: Caste, Islamophobia, and De/coloniality in India2020 • nishant upadhyayDownload Free PDFView PDFHyperglobalization's casualty: the numerical small : case of IndiaPurushottama BilimoriaDownload Free PDFView PDFTowards a Framework of Deep Diversity: Identity and Invisibility in the Indian Diaspora in New Zealand2015 • todd  nachowitzUsing the Indian diaspora in New Zealand as a case study, this thesis examines how state categorisation practices and nation building narratives have constructed and racialised migrant minorities, such as Indians, in particular ways. It does so through a review of the historical settlement narrative and census records that have tended to erase early ethnic minority presence from what is seen as a predominantly bicultural encounter. Aotearoan colonial society has tended to render early Indian presence in New Zealand invisible. This pattern remains perceptible in the prolonged use of homogenising ethnic categories utilised throughout the history of the New Zealand census that obfuscate the extent of ethnic minority diversification with specific reference to the Indian community. The thesis critiques state constructions of ethnic identity through (1) the presentation of alternative historical narratives that more appropriately demonstrate the presence of non-Māori non-European minorities at first contact; (2) an examination of minority reporting in the New Zealand census during the period of early European settlement; and (3) an analysis of data from a survey of the Indian community in New Zealand. The survey data on self-reported experiences of discrimination underscore the importance of ethnic self-identification and the use of more heterogeneous categories for appropriate minority recognition. At a theoretical level, the thesis outlines a novel framework for diversity governance, known as deep diversity, which is informed by an interdisciplinary methodological and theoretical approach that draws on the disciplines of anthropology, demography, history, and policy studies. This framework rethinks current policy approaches that position minorities as beneficiaries of policies designed for their social uplift and integration into majority society, and instead places the onus of social integration on both minorities and majorities. The framework is applied to an analysis of qualitative data from historical sources that fundamentally question New Zealand’s existing bicultural settlement narrative; to quantitative data from both historical and contemporary census records; and to a self-administered predominantly web-based survey of 1,124 Indian respondents using a snowball sampling method. This thesis presents an alternative historical settlement narrative that positions Indians as participating, along with Europeans, in first contact encounters with Māori in Aotearoa. Past and present census analysis also reveals the extent of historic Indian invisibility, and demonstrates continued state use of enumeration techniques that obscure and homogenise the diversity that exists within the Indian population. The survey results focus on the themes of identity and discrimination, the analysis of which offers insights about the importance of ethnic self- identification, the continued presence of discrimination, and the use of more heterogeneous categories for appropriate minority recognition. Specific survey results show that respondents, while identifying as ‘Indian’ on the census, favour terms that cite hyphenated nationality or ethnicity (e.g. Kiwi-Indian, Indo-Fijian) or regional, religious, linguistic and country of birth identifiers, as significant forms of self-identification. Results on discrimination demonstrate that 48.4% of survey respondents reported being the target of a discrimination event in New Zealand (86.9% of whom are migrants, while 13.1% were born in New Zealand). When queried about the presence of discrimination, 90.7% of respondents believe that racism and discrimination currently exist within New Zealand society, while only 9.3% believe that it does not exist. Minority invisibility contributes to social discrimination, and helps perpetuate the shallow diversity management practices in use today. More attention to the importance of appropriate minority self-identification and accommodation, involving majorities in minority integration programmes, and institutional support for a shared national identity, could all help facilitate and promote vital social cohesion strategies in New Zealand. The deep diversity framework articulated in this thesis offers an alternative vision for diversity governance and social cohesion that is appropriate for western liberal democracies with highly pluralised societies such as New Zealand.Download Free PDFView PDFSomatechnicsTransnational Bio/Necropolitics: Hindutva and its Avatars (Australia/India)2011 • Goldie OsuriDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
