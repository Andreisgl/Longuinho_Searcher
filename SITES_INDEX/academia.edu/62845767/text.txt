Net-proton number fluctuations and the Quantum Chromodynamics critical pointRequest PDFNet-proton number fluctuations and the Quantum Chromodynamics critical point2020I. VassilievAbstractObservations from collisions of heavy-ion at relativistic energies have established the formation of a new phase of matter, Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP), a deconfined state of quarks and gluons in a specific region of the temperature versus baryonic chemical potential phase diagram of strong interactions. A program to study the features of the phase diagram, such as a possible critical point, by varying the collision energy ($\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$), is performed at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) facility. Non-monotonic variation with $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ of moments of the net-baryon number distribution, related to the correlation length and the susceptibilities of the system, is suggested as a signature for a critical point. We report the first evidence of a non-monotonic variation in kurtosis $\times$ variance of the net-proton number (proxy for net-baryon number) distribution as a function of $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ with 3.1$\sigma$ significance, for head-on (central) gold-on-gold...I.
