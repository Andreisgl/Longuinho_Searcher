We examine how the wider context of temporality, restrictive mobility, and heightened uncertainty about the future affect people's ability to be mobile and to move back and forth for caregiving. In examining the wellbeing effects of such restrictions, we highlight their variable impact depending on factors such as socioeconomic positioning, life-course stage and health. The first sections of the paper present the care circulation framework and the particular meaning and function of proximate forms of care, as well as the main categories of care-related mobility that support this. We illustrate the dynamics and challenges faced by transnational family members, who engage in these care-related mobilities, through three vignettes involving care circulation between India and the UK, China and Australia, and Morocco and Belgium. In the final section, we discuss our vi-gnettes in relation to the political, physical, social and time dimensions of current regimes of mobility that impact on care-related mobilities. We argue that the regimes of mobility that currently govern care-related mobilities are best understood as 'immobilizing re-gimes' with important and undervalued implications for ontological security and wellbe-ing.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersJournal of Family ResearchIntroduction to the special issue "Transnational care: Families confronting borders"2020 • Laura  MerlaIn this article, we introduce the key themes of our Special Issue on "Transnational care: families confronting borders". Central to this collection is the question of how family relations and solidarities are impacted by the current scenario of closed borders and increasingly restrictive migration regimes. This question is examined more specifically through the lens of care dynamics within transnational families and their (re-) configurations across diverse contexts marked by "immobilizing regimes of migration". We begin by presenting a brief overview of key concepts in the transnational families and caregiving literature that provides a foundation for the diverse cases explored in the articles, including refugees and asylum seekers in Germany and Finland, Polish facing Brexit in the UK, Latin American migrants transiting through Mexico, and restrictionist drifts in migration policies in Australia, Belgium and the UK. Drawing on this rich work, we identify two policy tools; namely temporality and exclusion, which appear to be particularly salient features of immobilizing regimes of migration that significantly influence care-related mobilities. We conclude with a discussion of how immobilizing regimes are putting transnational family solidarities in crisis, including in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, gripping the globe at the time of writing.Download Free PDFView PDFTransnational families, care and wellbeingLaura  MerlaThe notion of ‘transnational families’ emerged at the beginning of the 21st century to designate in particular “families that live some or most of the time separated from each other, yet hold together and create something that can be seen as a feeling of collective welfare and unity, namely ‘familyhood’, even across national borders” (Bryceson and Vuorela, 2002: 18). Because of geographical distance, the maintenance of collective welfare and unity in transnational families largely relies on the ability of transnational family members to participate in the circulation of care across distance and national borders, an ability that represents a key feature of migrant wellbeing. The concept of care is indeed strongly related to issues surrounding welfare and wellbeing, both at an individual and collective level. As Daly (2011) points out, care relates not only to the servicing of the needs of those who cannot take care of themselves as well as those who are able-bodied, it also emphasises in a broader sense the relational foundations of all social life. In other words, ‘key elements of people’s welfare inhere in their relations with others and the reciprocity around responses to need and the receipt of recognition and value for who people are’ (Daly, 2011: 47-48). In this chapter, we define the circulation of care in transnational families as a ‘capability’ (Sen, 1987), and discuss how the ability to participate in care exchanges impacts on the well-being of transnational family members – in terms of the provision of their care needs, of reciprocal care obligations and practices, and of identity recognition. This also leads us to examine the ways in which new communication technologies transform the ways in which caring relationships are experienced and practiced, and to highlight how policy mediates families' capabilities to care across distance.Download Free PDFView PDF    In book: Handbook of Migration and Globalisation, Chapter: 25, Publisher: Edward Elgar Publishing, Editors: Anna TriandafyllidouTransnational families in the era of global mobility2018 • Laura  Merla, Majella KilkeyAs a result of the dominance of highly individualised, economistic and gendered analyses of migration and globalisation processes, family life has often been relegated to the 'back stage' of research on globalisation and migration. However, a number of closely linked developments in both fields are raising awareness of the critical position that family occupies in the relationship between migration and globalisation, pushing analyses of family life to the 'front stage' of research. In this chapter, we examine the relationship between family, globalisation and migration through the lens of care, focusing specifically on the experiences of transnational families. We begin by examining how uneven globalisation processes produce 'crises of care', which migration can help alleviate. We move on to explore the transnational care strategies migrants and their kin members in the country of origin develop to maintain familyhood across borders, including when trapped in immobility. In such a context, the opportunities provided by ICTs to maintain connections and to care across distance have become especially important. We conclude by arguing that mobility and internet access are thus key features of globalisation that require careful policy attention at both national and transnational levels.Download Free PDFView PDFKilkenny, M., Merla, L. & Baldassar, L.

Recent studies reveal that state policies and international regulations influence the maintenance of transnational family solidarity. We aim to contribute to our understanding of how families’ care-giving arrangements are situated within institutional contexts. We specify an analytical framework comprising a typology of care-giving arrangements within transnational families, a typology of resources they require for care giving, and a specification of institutions through which those resources are in part derived. We illustrate the framework through a comparative analysis of two groups of migrants – Salvadorans in Belgium and Poles in the UK. We conclude by arguing that while institutions matter they are not the sole factor, and identify how future research might develop a more fully comprehensive situated transnationalism.Download Free PDFView PDFSpecial Issue "The social reproductive worlds of migrants", Journal of Family Studies, Vol 24 (2018). Coordinated by Majella Kilkey, Laura Merla & Loretta BaldassarLaura  MerlaThe articles in this special issue contribute new insights to a growing body of scholarship on the risks and opportunities migration presents for migrant families’ social reproduction, variously understood as the physical and social/cultural processes entailed in reproducing people, and the strategies migrants develop to navigate those risks and opportunities. Informed by the notion of ‘care circulation’(Baldassar & Merla, 2014), collectively the articles capture a range of migration flows within and between the Global South and Global North, involving low- and high-skilled migrants, with social reproductive responsibilities spanning both ends of the life course, and situated in local/proximate, as well as distant/transnational, contexts.Download Free PDFView PDFPapers: Revista de SociologiaMerla, L., & Baldassar, L., (2016) Response: Special Review Symposium, Transnational Families, Migration and the Circulation of Care, Papers: Revista de Sociologia, 101(2), 275-284.2016 • Loretta BaldassarEste simposio ofrece una discusión crítica de las lógicas y dinámicas en torno a la nueva perspectiva de la «circulación del cuidado» presentadas por Loretta Baldassar y Laura Merla en su volumen titulado Transnational Families, Migration and the Circulation of Care.

Moreover, they challenge our traditional methodological and theoretical conceptualisations of family life. The dramatic increase in mobility and the revolution in modes of travel and communication across distance have made it imperative for family studies to examine the impact of processes of migration and, more specifically, distance and separation, on family relationships. In contrast to the past, migratory moves and other forms of family mobility today are more likely to be characterised by regular and frequent communication and linkages between sending and receiving areas, giving rise to conceptualisations of transnational family members and global households. Through the lens of transnational family caregiving, this chapter examines these issues, including the practical and policy implications of sustaining families across time and space.Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of Family Research Family lives on hold: Bureaucratic bordering in male refugees' struggle for transnational care2020 • Lena NäreThis article analyses practices of transnational care and the lives of male asylum seekers and refugee families in the context of increasingly restrictive border and migration regimes. Research on transnationalism, transnational families, and care among forced migrants has emphasised the importance of the institutional context in transnational care and family relations across borders. This article contributes to the extant literature by examining how bureaucratic bordering-within nation states and beyond-restricts the possibilities of refugees in providing care to their family members and reuniting. The article also examines the struggles experienced by male refugees at bureaucratic borders. These struggles reveal a central dimension to transnational care that relates to the bureaucracy of visas and residence permits. The article highlights the importance of temporality and examines how the lives of refugee families are affected by extended and bureaucratically induced waiting. The article is based on ethnographic research conducted on Iraqi and Af-ghan asylum seekers in Finland in 2017-2019 and focuses on three asylum seekers in particular namely , Amal, Sajed, and Yasin.Download Free PDFView PDFConcluding reflections: 'Care circulation' in an increasingly mobile world: Further thoughtsLaura  MerlaIn this paper, Laura Merla and Loretta Baldassar address some of the key critiques that were formulated in a Symposium on the 'care circulation " perspective these two authors offered in their edited volume entitled " Transnational Families, Migration and the Circulation of Care ". Here, they focus in particular on three themes highlighted by their three reviewers ( Laura Oso Casas, Joan Tronto, and Pierrette Hondagneu-Sotelo): care as social capital, the need to bring back 'the political', and the (dis)-embodiment of care practices. They highlight in particular that 'care chains' and 'care circulation' should not be seen as opposite, but rather as complementary perspectives. Resumen. Reflexiones finales.
