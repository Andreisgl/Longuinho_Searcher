Earlier research has called for greater levels of teacher preparation, and, while many school districts provide greater compensation for teachers with graduate degrees, some districts have begun phasing out this type of compensation. Complicating the question of the value of compensating teachers for graduate training is an absence of quantitative data that supports or rejects the concept that teacher graduate education positively contributes to student achievement. The purpose for this research was to ascertain the degree to which teacher graduate training supports student reading achievement. Results of this research demonstrated master’s degrees have a limited positive impact on student reading achievement. However, more study is needed.Save to LibraryDownloadby Carol Carman and +1Kevin Badgett•  5  Data Analysis, Student Achievement, Multiple regression analysis, Reading achievementDevelopment and validation of Pagbabaybay (Spelling) and Pagkilala sa Salita (Word Recognition) of the Filipino Reading Achievement TestThe objective of this cross-sectional exploratory study is to develop and standardize two subtest for the proposed Filipino Reading Achievement Test.

Subtests measuring Pagbabaybay or Spelling in Filipino and Pagkilala sa Binasa or Word Recognition was constructed. The focus of the study is assessing the validity and reliability of these instruments in order to justify its use in assessing the reading abilities of Filipino children. Assessing reading ability is essential because reading has been considered as one of the most important skill an individual needs to develop in order to succeed both in school and in the world of work. The study followed the standard scale development procedures of item analysis, reliability and validity testing. Implications of the findings are discussed.Save to LibraryDownloadby Ryan Francis  Cayubit•  4  Reading, Spelling, Word Recognition, Reading achievementLocalized Curriculum on the Reading Achievement of Grade 8 StudentsThis study aimed to determine whether a localized curriculum would improve the reading achievement of the Grade 8 students.

The research subjects were the Grade 8 students of Escalante National High School, Negros Occidental, Philippines. Pretest-posttest experimental design was utilized in this study. Two groups of subjects were compared in terms of their pretest and posttest results. The experimental group was exposed to the localized curriculum for their reading instruction while the control group received the reading instruction as prescribed by the K to 12-Grade 8 English curriculum. The data were obtained using the researcher-made test instrument. Descriptive mean, paired and independent sample t-tests were the statistical tools used for the data analysis. The research findings revealed that the reading achievement of the Grade 8 students in English in the experimental group improved from 'approaching proficient' to 'proficient'. It implied that localized curriculum helped increase the level of reading achievement of the students, thus the hypothesis of no significant difference between the pretest and posttest of the experimental group was rejected. This study suggested that since localized curriculum improved the reading achievement of the students, the school may establish a 'school-based curriculum localization matrix aside from using the 'regional and division curriculum localization matrix' and ensure a continuous capability building for teachers on how to localize curriculum. A similar investigation may be conducted like the teachers' knowledge and skills and effective strategies in localized curriculum in relation the students' academic performance.Save to LibraryDownloadby Research and Statistics Center•  4  K to 12 Basic Education Curriculum, Reading achievement, curriculum localization matrix,  localized curriculumInfluence of Phonological Awareness, Morphological Awareness and Non-verbal ability on Reading Comprehension in Malayalam Save to LibraryDownloadby kunnathodi abdul gafoor•  5  Languages and Linguistics, Malayalam, Reading Comprehension, Psycholinguistics, English Language Teaching, Learning Strategies, Reading Comprehension, Learning Style, Vocabulary StrategiesParental Involvement in School Activities and Student Reading Achievement – Theoretical Perspectives and PIRLS 2011 FindingsEnhancing parental involvement is a major concern for policymakers in education in many countries.

Literature review has exposed strong connections between parental involvements in school activities and student outcomes (also achievements). For exploring the association between parental involvement in school activities and student reading achievement, we used data from the latest cycle of the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS 2011) conducted by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA). The study assesses reading literacy at Grade 4 using representative samples of students in the participating education systems. PIRLS also collects extensive, internationally comparable information on the background characteristics of the students, their parents, teachers and the schools where they study. We conducted the analyses utilizing information on parental involvement in school activities (as reported by school principals), parental level of education (as reported by parents), and student reading achievement (PIRLS achievement scores). We used data from 54 of 56 education systems that included all relevant data needed for the analyses. Regarding that, this paper seeks to answer two questions. First, is there a relationship between parental involvement in school activities and student reading achievement in the education systems participating in PIRLS 2011? Given that both parental involvement and student achievement are often influenced by the family socio-economic context, the second question is whether parental involvement is associated with the level of parental education within each of the analysed education systems? This paper presents evidence demonstrating that within most of the 54 education systems we analysed, parental involvement in school activities is positively associated with student performance in PIRLS 2011. That is to say, students enrolled in schools with higher parental involvement tend to have higher reading achievement. It also shows that the level of parental involvement in school is positively associated with the level of parental education. Thus, parents with lower education levels are likely to participate less in school and vice versa. The conclusions suggest that the promotion of parental involvement may be an effective strategy for increasing reading achievement, and policies in this direction are particularly relevant for schools with students whose parents have lower levels of education.Save to LibraryDownloadby Andres Sandoval-Hernandez and +1Eva Klemencic•  4  Parental Involvement in Education, Large Scale Assessment, PIRLS, Reading achievementCross-Modal Priming Effect of Rhythm on Visual Word Recognition and Its Relationships to Music Aptitude and Reading AchievementRecent evidence suggests the existence of shared neural resources for rhythm processing in language and music.

Such overlaps could be the basis of the facilitating effect of regular musical rhythm on spoken word processing previously reported for typical children and adults, as well as adults with Parkinson’s disease and children with developmental language disorders. The present study builds upon these previous findings by examining whether non-linguistic rhythmic priming also influences visual word processing, and the extent to which such cross-modal priming effect of rhythm is related to individual differences in musical aptitude and reading skills. An electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded while participants listened to a rhythmic tone prime, followed by a visual target word with a stress pattern that either matched or mismatched the rhythmic structure of the auditory prime. Participants were also administered standardized assessments of musical aptitude and reading achievement. Event-related potentials (ERPs) elicited by target words with a mismatching stress pattern showed an increased fronto-central negativity. Additionally, the size of the negative effect correlated with individual differences in musical rhythm aptitude and reading comprehension skills. Results support the existence of shared neurocognitive resources for linguistic and musical rhythm processing, and have important implications for the use of rhythm-based activities for reading interventions.Save to LibraryDownloadby Tess S Fotidzis•  5  Event related brain potentials (ERPs), Implicit Prosody, Language and Musical Aptitude, Reading achievementRelationships between Reading Motivation, Reading Activity, Oral Language, and Reading Achievement in Children with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity DisorderFifteen third and fourth graders with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder were asked to complete reading self-efficacy and reading activity scales and standardized tests of oral and written language to examine the relationships... moreFifteen third and fourth graders with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder were asked to complete reading self-efficacy and reading activity scales and standardized tests of oral and written language to examine the relationships between reading self-efficacy, reading activity, oral language, and reading achievement, with gender and age controlled. Students with higher self-efficacy for personally relevant reading activities displayed higher reading achievement, whereas those who held higher self-efficacy for fundamental reading skills displayed lower reading achievement, suggesting inflated perceived competence possibly due to metacognitive deficits. Students’ reading performance decreased with age, suggesting the presence of Matthew effects. Fourth graders displayed higher task self-efficacy than third graders. Reading activity, oral language, and gender did not contribute significantly to predicting reading achievement in this sample of children.Save to LibraryDownloadby Mei Shen•  3  ADHD, Reading motivation, Reading achievementFamily Background, Gender and Reading Achievement in RomaniaIn the last years, Romania formally tried to overcome the problems related to inequality of opportunity in education.

Yet, there are only few studies analyzing how the social background of students influences educational inequality in the country. This paper examines the role of home resources and gender in determining academic performance, a central concept in the area of sociology of education. Based on secondary data drawn from PIRLS 2011 (Progress in International Reading Literacy Study) for Romania, we suggest that gender and home resources have a significant impact on the reading achievement of students. The existing work operationalizes the differences in academic performance as an indicator for life chances, being proportional with continuation of studies or economic success later in life. Thus, it is important to understand if ascribed characteristics such as gender or factors related to the family background of students could have an effect on individual life chances. Our findings contradict the ideas about equality of opportunity and participation promoted by the official curriculum or by public discourses regarding the individual merit as the main factor that places students in privileged social positions. The topic of this paper is important both in the context of quasi-generalized discontent about academic performance of Romanian graduates and in the context of the fast process of polarization and social stratification that characterizes post-communist Romania.Save to LibraryDownloadby Gheba Andreea and +1Sebastian  Toc•  5  Sociology of Education, Educational Inequalities (class; race; gender etc), Romania, Academic achievementSCHOOL MATERIAL RESOURCES AND STUDENT READING ACHIEVEMENT IN THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES: PISA 2018 data through the lens of Ecological Systems TheoryAim: This study aimed to 1) identify differences in overall student reading achievement in the UAE based on student gender, 2) determine if there is school material resource inequity in the UAE based on school location or school type, and... moreAim:This study aimed to 1) identify differences in overall student reading achievement in the UAE based on student gender, 2) determine if there is school material resource inequity in the UAE based on school location or school type, and 3) measure the effects of school material resources on student reading achievement in the UAE while controlling for other variables.Theory:The theoretical framework used for this study is Bronfenbrenner’s Ecological Systems Theory including the Process-Person-Context-Time model.Method:Statistical analyses using UAE’s PISA 2018 data included t-test, principal component analysis, PLUM ordinal regression, and two-level hierarchical linear modeling.Results:This study joins a small but growing amount of research focused on using data such as PISA’s to better understand the UAE educational system and perhaps to help further its reforms. Findings include: Girls outperformed boys in reading achievement in the UAE. As for material resource inequity based on school type, co-ed schools were more likely than either of the single-sex school types to report that their school’s capacity to enhance learning and teaching using digital devices was sufficient. However, co-ed schools were also more likely to report that their school’s capacity to provide instruction was hindered due to the quantity/quality of the material resources when compared to either of the single-sex schools. While almost all of the relationships in the regressions were statistically significant (school type, emirate, and school urbanization level), both models did a poor job of fitting the data. Finally, of the two school material resources indices used in this study, the school materials index was not related to reading achievement, but the school digital devices index was a significant predictor of student reading achievement. Every unit increase in the index corresponded to a 9.069 increase in the predicted reading achievement score. Although the included variables reduced the variance, some unaccounted variance remains.Save to LibraryDownloadby Linda Gogliotti•  7  Gender and education, Programme for International Students Assessment (PISA), Bronfenbrenner, Ecological Systems TheoryThe Effect of Metacognitive Strategy Instruction on Moroccan EFL Learners' Strategy Use and Reading Achievement The Effect of Metacognitive Strategy Instruction on Moroccan EFL MsaddekThe intent of this quasi-experimental study is to investigate the impact of explicit metacognitive reading strategy instruction (RSI) on Moroccan English as a foreign language (EFL) university learners' strategy use and reading... moreThe intent of this quasi-experimental study is to investigate the impact of explicit metacognitive reading strategy instruction (RSI) on Moroccan English as a foreign language (EFL) university learners' strategy use and reading achievement. It reflects whether this sort of instruction can make of learners strategic and critical readers. In this regard, a pre-post-test design involving the administration of reading comprehension pre-and post-tests to both the control and the treatment group was used. Two research questions were addressed: To what extent does explicit metacognitive reading strategy instruction influence Moroccan EFL university learners' strategy usage? To what extent does explicit instruction in metacognitive reading strategies impact Moroccan EFL university learners' reading achievement gains? A total of 113 participants were targeted in an attempt to reveal the perceived correlation exiting among the variables of strategy training, strategy use and reading achievement. The elicited data were collected by means of the reading comprehension texts, 'self-report questionnaire' and reading comprehension tests (e.g., pre-test, post-test). The findings unveiled that, through exposure to reading strategy training, as an effective medium of enhancing the learners' reading potential, the experimental group (N=63) reflected a more significant improvement at the level of strategy usage and reading performance than their counterpart, the control group (N=50), did at post-testing. Finally, the study concludes with some recommendations relatable to pedagogy and research.Save to LibraryDownloadby Arab World English Journal  (AWEJ)•  4  Metacognition, Reading achievement, Strategy Use,  reading strategy instructionNeurofeedback as an intervention to improve reading achievement in students with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, inattentive subtypeResearch consistently demonstrates that attention deficits have a deleterious effect on academic achievement.

Impairments in attention, and not hyperactivity/impulsivity, are associated with learning difficulties and academic problems in students with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). To date, most studies have focused on symptoms of hyperactivity/impulsivity, with little research being conducted on interventions for students with ADHD, inattentive subtype. This study examines the use of neurofeedback as an intervention to improve reading achievement in a public school setting. A multiple-baseline-across-participants single-case model was used to assess five fourth-grade students who received 40 daily sessions of neurofeedback. Following the intervention, improvements were observed on objective measures of attention: a continuous performance test (Integrated Visual and Auditory Continuous Performance Test [IVA+Plus]) and/or a test of shifting attention (CNS Vital Signs, Shifting Attention Test [CNS-VS, SAT]). Results on tests of reading fluency revealed little change, although participants demonstrated gains on a measure of reading comprehension (Gray Oral Reading Tests–Fifth Edition [GORT-5]). Results suggest that neurofeedback helped participants to become more accurately engaged with the text with more focused attention to content. Thus, neurofeedback may be a viable option to assist children with attention deficits for improving both attention and reading achievement.Save to LibraryDownloadby Rollanda O'Connor and +1Jeff  La Marca•  7  Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, ADHD (Psychology), Neurofeedback, Reading ComprehensionLocalized Curriculum on the Reading Achievement of Grade 8 StudentsThis study aimed to determine whether a localized curriculum would improve the reading achievement of the Grade 8 students.

Research shows that learners who read extensively tend to accomplish a high level of academic achievement. In Malaysia, the educational goal has shifted from simply forming literate citizens to nurturing a well-educated and intellectual society. Promoting efficient reading habits can be an effective approach to realizing this goal. This study, therefore, aims to examine reading habits and ascertain their correlation with reading achievement among final-year English as a Second Language (ESL) learners in selected Malaysian secondary schools. The study utilized a cross-sectional survey in which data were gathered from a sample of 351 ESL learners using questionnaires and written tests as data-gathering instruments. The analysis was conducted by means of descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation, and simple linear regression. The findings revealed a significant relationship between ESL learners' reading habits and their reading achievement. Additionally, ESL learners' reading habits contribute significantly to their reading achievement. These findings highlight the significance of reading habits in determining ESL learners' reading achievement itself. However, this study is limited to reading habits and reading achievement among students in selected secondary schools. Thus, further research may replicate this study in the context of computer-assisted or blended learning.Save to LibraryDownloadby Arab World English Journal  (AWEJ)•  6  Secondary schools, Reading Habits, ESL learners, Reading achievementTelling Themselves Who They Are: What One Out-of-School Time Study Revealed about Underachieving ReadersThe purpose of this study was to explore whether or not adolescents who are deemed underachievers and who struggle to read school-assigned textbooks will engage with popular culture texts of their own choosing (eg, magazines, comics, TV,... moreThe purpose of this study was to explore whether or not adolescents who are deemed underachievers and who struggle to read school-assigned textbooks will engage with popular culture texts of their own choosing (eg, magazines, comics, TV, video games, music CDs, graffiti, e-mail, and other Internet-mediated texts).
