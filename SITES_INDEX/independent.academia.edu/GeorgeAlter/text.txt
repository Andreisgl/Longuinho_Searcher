Previous generations relied on demographic models to squeeze as much information as possible from the small amounts of data available. In this new era of large data sets, researchers are creating both regional and international historical data sets of unprecedented size and depth. When examined closely, however, the regression methods used today make the same simplifying assumptions that generated the key advances of earlier generations. These new methods require demographic insight to inform analyses and enrich conclusions.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

However, we encountered several challenges during the process due to the differences in how the metadata are structured and what information the metadata are designed to capture between various data repositories (i.e., source data repositories) and DATS.  In this presentation we introduce the method used in the metadata mapping and the challenges we encountered during the process of mapping.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

CAMPOP: 26 English family reconstitutions in intermediate data structure format with fertility analysis files 1967-1997Wrigley, Schofield, Oeppen and Davies&#39; &#39;English Population History from Family Reconstitu... more Wrigley, Schofield, Oeppen and Davies&#39; &#39;English Population History from Family Reconstitution 1580-1837&#39; (1997) was important both for its scope and its methodology. It was based on data from 26 family reconstitutions carefully selected to represent 250 years of English demographic history (UKDA-SN-853082). These data remain relevant for new research questions, such as studying the intergenerational inheritance of fertility and mortality. To expand their availability the family reconstitutions have been transcribed to Intermediate Data Structure (IDS) and an episode file for fertility analysis in this data collection. These files were used for fertility analysis in George Alter, Gill Newton, and Jim Oeppen, &quot;Re-introducing the Cambridge Group Family Reconstitutions,&quot; Historical Life Course Studies (in review). The contents and structure of IDS files are described in Alter, G., & Mandemakers, K.

Software-independent data transformation descriptions will be added to metadata in two internationally accepted standards, the Data Documentation Initiative (DDI) and Ecological Metadata Language (EML). These tools will create efficiencies and reduce the costs of data collection, preparation, and re-use. Our project targets research communities with strong metadata standards and heavy reliance on statistical analysis software (social and behavioral sciences and earth observation sciences), but it is generalizable to other domains, such as biomedical research.

Instructors in the workshops are listed below. Funding was provided by The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, grants R25-HD040525 and R25-HD-049479, the ICPSR Summer Program and the ICPSR Director. The course was designed to teach students the theories, methods, and practices of historical demography and to give them first-hand experience working with historical data.

The volume was based on data from family reconstitutions of 26 parishes carefully selected to represent 250 years of English demographic history. These data remain relevant for new research questions, such as studying the intergenerational inheritance of fertility and mortality. To expand their availability the family reconstitutions have been translated into new formats: a relational database, the Intermediate Data Structure (IDS) and an episode file for fertility analysis. This paper describes that process and examines the impact of methodological decisions on analysis of the data. Wrigley, Davies, Oeppen, and Schofield were sensitive to changes in the quality of the parish registers and cautiously applied the principles of family reconstitution developed by Louis Henry.
