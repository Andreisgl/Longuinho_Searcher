To detect long-term correlations and multifractal behavior in the presence of trends, we apply recently developed methods (detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) and multifractal DFA) that can systematically detect nonstationarities and overcome trends in the data at all timescales. We find that above some crossover time that usually is several weeks, the daily runoffs are characterized by an asymptotic scaling exponent that indicates a slow power law decay of the runoff autocorrelation function and varies from river to river in a wide range. Below the crossovers, pronounced short-term correlations occur. In contrast, most of the precipitation series show scaling behavior corresponding to a rapid decay of the autocorrelation function. For the multifractal characterization of the data we determine the generalized Hurst exponents and fit them by three...See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersExtreme Events and Natural Hazards: the Complexity PerspectivePrecipitation and River Flow: Long-Term Memory and Predictability of Extreme Events2012 • Mikhail BogachevDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of HydrologyLong-term persistence and multifractality of river runoff records: Detrended fluctuation studies2006 • Jan KantelhardtDownload Free PDFView PDFITISE 2016 ProceedingsClimate dynamics analysis with the use of multifractal method2016 • Jaromir Krzyszczak, Piotr BaranowskiMultifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MF-DFA) was used to assess climate dynamics in two locations (Spain and Finland). The studied time series indicated underlying multifractal structure with considerable differences of the dynamics and the development between the locations. Additionally, the type of multifractality was investigated by analyzing the corresponding shuffled and surrogate time series. While the multifractality of precipitation time series was largely influenced by the width of the probability function, the multifractality of other meteorological series was mainly due to different long-range correlations for small and large fluctuations. The obtained results may be especially valuable for assessing the change of climate dynamics, as we also divided all meteorological time series into the subsets 1980-2001 and 2002-2010 and compared respective spectra of those subsets. We found that larger changes in asymmetry and width parameters of multifractal spectra for divided datasets were observed for precipitation than for other time series, which suggest that this meteorological quantity is the most vulnerable to change of climate dynamics.Download Free PDFView PDFPhysica A-statistical Mechanics and Its ApplicationsFractal analysis of river flow fluctuations2008 • M MovahedDownload Free PDFView PDFHydrological ProcessesMultifractal detrended fluctuation analysis of streamflow series of the Yangtze River basin, China2008 • Chong-Yu XuScaling and multifractal properties of the hydrological processes of the Yangtze River basin were explored by using a multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MF-DFA) technique.
