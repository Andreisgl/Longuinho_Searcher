Through a close examination of the work's frequently masked revaluation of a series of Greek sources of thinking, not least its 'inversion' of both the metaphysics and the aesthetics of Plato's Republic, the article shows how the thesis of aesthetic 'justification' is caught up in a tension between Apolline and Dionysian interpretations, the first entailing a quasi-Homeric sense that the Olympians justify human existence by living a transfigured form of it themselves, the second involving a tragic insight into reality as itself the creative work of a 'world-artist', the latter allusively associated by Nietzsche with the philosophy of Heraclitus.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersThe Ancient Quarrel between Philosophy and Poetry in Nietzsche’s Early WritingsMatthew MeyerDownload Free PDFView PDFNietzsche PhilologyPeter D MurrayDownload Free PDFView PDFTranslation of Friedrich Nietzsche's _The Dionysian Vision of the World_Friedrich Ulfers, Ira  AllenDownload Free PDFView PDFNietzsche, Tragedy, and the Theory of Catharsis (2016)James I.

WilsonThe paper is a close reading of Nietzsche's early essay, "Homer on Competition". It explores the understanding of nature as strife presented in that essay, how this strife channels itself into cultural or state forms, and how these forms cultivate the creative individual or genius. The article concludes by asserting that Nietzsche's central point in "Homer on Competition" concerns the contest across the ages that is fought by these geniuses. For Nietzsche, therefore, competition has a political significance — the forging of the unity and identity of a particular community — and a transpolitical significance — the forging of a "republic of geniuses" on the part of artists and philosophers across the expanse of the tradition.Download Free PDFView PDFRoutledgeNietzsche and 'The Birth of Tragedy'2014 • Paul DanielsNietzsche's philosophy is both revolutionary and profound, reaching into all spheres of the arts. The acuity of his ideas and the complexity of his writings ensure Nietzsche's enduring power to engage his readers. Nietzsche's first book, 'The Birth of Tragedy', is an astonishing analysis of the meaning of Greek tragedy. He confronts us with the idea that the grave truth to our existence can be revealed through tragic art, and that our relationship to the world can be transfigured from pessimistic despair into sublime elation and affirmation. 'Nietzsche and The Birth of Tragedy' provides a clear account of the text and its philosophical, literary and historical influences. Each chapter examines part of the text, explaining the ideas presented and assessing relevant scholarly points of interpretation. The book will be an invaluable guide to readers in philosophy, literary studies and classics coming to 'The Birth of Tragedy' for the first time.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
