Present-day medical scholars, journalists, and other commentators have often ignored, downplayed or treated with scepticism the role of bacterial vaccines in reducing mortality during the pandemic. There have been repeated claims in this century that these vaccines were ‘useless’, ‘concocted’, and possibly harmful. Focussing on the Australian scene, I show that bacterial vaccines from reputable sources did indeed reduce mortality, perhaps to a greater extent in some cases than modern anti-viral influenza vaccines.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The use of chemical restraints and their effects on patients at a major insane asylum in Sydney, New South Wales, in the late colonial and early Federation period are examined. Sedated patients required less labour to feed, toilet, and control and, unlike physically restrained patients, were less likely to attract adverse comment from visitors. Although the rapid growth of asylums in this era of ‘moral management’ would have been impossible without the use of chemical restraints, it is questionable as to whether this approach was beneficial to the patientsSave to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The 'recruitment' of these patients, for the most part undertaken by untrained men, was brutal and arbitrary and the treatments ineffective and harsh. The annual death rate in the hospitals was about 25%, yet the West Australian government claimed that the problem had been 'soundly handled'.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This thesis explores the reasons for these deaths and how patients came to harm. It examines the expectation of hospital life for the most vulnerable groups of patients, comparing mortality at Claremont with mortality at other institutions. The distinctive economic, political and social conditions in Western Australia, a frontier state, framed the ‘special path’ of the historical development of mental health care in Western Australia. I show that this special path was the overarching factor determining the comparatively brief lives of Claremont patients. While general paralysis of the insane was a major cause of death of male patients at Claremont, I suggest that ‘senile’ patients were the most vulnerable group. Overseas studies show that shortages of food caused the premature deaths of thousands of asylum patients during World War I, particularly in Britain and Germany, but the evidence indicates that average mortality rates at Australian asylums were not significantly affected during the War.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
