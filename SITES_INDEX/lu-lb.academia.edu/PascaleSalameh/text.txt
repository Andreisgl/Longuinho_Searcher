Our objective is to assess the effect of nutritional habits on asthma and allergies in Lebanese children aged 3-16 years old. This is a case-control study, conducted between December 2015 and April 2016. The Food Frequency Questionnaire was composed of 16 semi-quantitative questions covering different food categories. This study included 1,276 children (976 healthy and 300 asthmatic children). Eating dairy products less than twice a week, 3-6 times per week and daily were significantly and inversely associated with asthma, as compared to never eating dairy products (p = 0.02, ORa = 0.285, CI 0.099-0.821; p &amp;amp;amp;lt; 0.001, ORa = 0.140, CI 0.052-0.378 and p &amp;amp;amp;lt; 0.001, ORa = 0.161, CI 0.061-0.422), whereas eating red meat daily compared to never was associated with asthma significantly (p = 0.037, ORa = 2.051, CI 1.046-4.024). Eating nuts less than twice weekly as compared to never was significantly and inversely associated with asthma (p = 0.035, ORa = 0.597, CI 0.369-0.965). The age categories 7-10 and 11-13 years were significantly associated with asthma as compared to the 3-6 years category (p &amp;amp;amp;lt; 0.001, ORa = 3.359, CI 1.869-6.038 and p = 0.008, ORa = 2.191, CI 1.228-3.909, respectively), while male gender was significantly more prone to asthma (p = 0.014, ORa = 0.686, CI 0.507-0.926). Knowing the correlation between nutritional habits and asthma is important to promote healthy eating. Educational programs for parents about healthy food and breastfeeding encouragement is warranted.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This meta-analysis synthesized data from observational studies to investigate the association between obesity and depression among adult populations in Middle Eastern countries. Five bibliographical electronic databases were searched for studies published up to April 2014. Pooled meta-analytic estimates were derived using the random-effect models. Three case-control studies and five cross-sectional studies were identified. Meta-analysis showed significant positive associations between obesity and depression across study designs, with an overall effect of odds ratio 1.27 (95% confidence interval 1.11-1.44). The association between obesity and depression was more marked in women than men although that difference was not statistically significant. Other subgroup analysis showed that none of the potential factors including the assessment for obesity or depression, confounder control and study quality had a modification effect on the studied association. Meta-analysis of eight observational studies from five countries in the Middle East suggests an evidence of a positive association between obesity and depression among adult populations, which appeared to be more marked among women. Future research should examine the causal pathways between obesity and depression.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Sequentially, pharmacists are responsible for order verification, a step that follows transcription. Accordingly, they are the last safety net to intercept and correct near miss transcription errors before reaching the patient Purpose The objective of this study was to assess the role of hospital pharmacist in preventing and reporting transcription errors Material and methods This was a retrospective observational study. All hospitalised patients in a tertiary care hospital admitted from January 2009 to December 2015 were included. Patients’ charts were screened for errors by clinical pharmacists. Medication related physician orders and home medication discharge orders were reviewed. All detected errors in the medication use process were recorded using a validated medication error reporting form. Results 734 transcription errors were identified in the charts of 30440 patients. Most reported transcription errors occurred in the department of internal medicine (72.3%) followed by surgery (9.9%). Approximately 52.9% of reported medication errors occurred with prescribed parenteral medications and 35% with orally administered drugs. Antimicrobials and cardiovascular medications were the main drug classes affected (24.5% and 14.8%, respectively). Results showed that the reasons behind errors were wrong doses (21.8%), drug omissions (20.6%), wrong medications (17.3%) and wrong drug frequencies (15.7%). Errors were classified as near miss in 91.3% of cases, while only 8.7% were considered errors that reached the patient with no harm done. It was noted that wrong dose and wrong bar code increased significantly the severity of errors, compared with drug omission (p=0.026 and p=0.001, respectively). With regard to drug classes, the results showed that analgesics, and respiratory and antidiabetic medications increased significantly the risk of errors compared with antibiotics (p=0.011; p=0.029; p=0.002, respectively). Finally, reporting errors from the medicine or surgery ward increased significantly the risk of error, compared with reporting from the pharmacy department (p=0.049). Conclusion In the absence of health information systems, pharmacists play a major role in preventing near miss transcription errors and securing patient safety. This is a continuous process through vigilant surveillance, proactive audits and effective reporting.

METHODS This cross-sectional study, conducted between January and May 2018, enrolled 811 participants selected randomly from all Lebanese Mohafazat. The mean age of the participants was 27.6±11.8 years. The majority were females (66.5%), had a high level of education (73.2%), and low income (77.9%). This study used the following scales: body dissatisfaction subscale of the Eating Disorder Inventory-second version, binge eating scale, Dutch restrained eating scale, orthorexia nervosa scale (ORTHO-15 scale), emotional eating scale, perceived stress scale, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. RESULTS Body dissatisfaction was positively correlated to restrained eating (r=0.293, P&lt;0.001), emotional eating (r=0.073, P=0.042) and binge eating (r=0.250, P&lt;0.001). The interaction between body dissatisfaction and gender was significantly associated with more restrained eating (Beta=0.01, P&lt;0.001) and orthorexia nervosa (Beta=-0.09, P&lt;0.001), but not with emotional (Beta=-0.43, P=0.103) and binge eating (Beta=-0.08, P=0.358). When stratifying the analysis by gender, the results revealed that higher body dissatisfaction was significantly associated with more restrained eating in both genders, but particularly among women. Body dissatisfaction was significantly associated with higher emotional eating in men only and with higher orthorexia nervosa tendencies and behaviors in females only. CONCLUSION The interaction between body dissatisfaction and gender was significantly associated with orthorexia nervosa and restrained eating but not with binge or emotional eating. Higher body dissatisfaction was significantly associated with higher restrained eating, more pronounced in women, while it was significantly associated with higher orthorexia tendencies (lower ORTO-15 scores) in women only. Body dissatisfaction was associated with emotional eating in men only.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Construction and validation of the Lebanese Osteoporosis Knowledge Scale among a representative sample of Lebanese womenOsteoporosis International,  2019Summary Our study aimed at constructing and validating the Lebanese Osteoporosis Knowledge Scale ... more Summary Our study aimed at constructing and validating the Lebanese Osteoporosis Knowledge Scale adapted for use among Lebanese women and to assess factors associated with the poorest knowledge of osteoporosis definition, risk factors, and preventive measures. This scale showed adequate psychometric properties; higher knowledge scores were reached in women who already heard about the disease and had a formal education. As a result, the LOKS-19 can be used to measure knowledge of osteoporosis and help assess osteoporosis-related interventions. Introduction The primary objective of this study was to describe the construction of the Lebanese Osteoporosis Knowledge Scale (LOKS) and assess its psychometric properties in a representative sample of Lebanese women aged 40 years and above. Secondary objectives were to explore factors associated with this knowledge score. Methods A cross-sectional study carried out between March and June 2018, enrolled 560 women over the age of 40 years living in the community. This proportionate sample was randomly selected from all Lebanese governorates to cover the entire Lebanese area. A survey was developed and adapted to the Lebanese population based on preexisting scales. Personal interviews were conducted to collect data. Results The items of the LOKS were distributed across seven factors with an Eigenvalue over 1 solution, outlining an overall value of 55.89% of the variance. A high Cronbach’s alpha was found for the full scale (0.725). Individuals having a university level of education (beta = 1.62; compared to illiteracy), having heard of osteoporosis (beta = 2.62), taking supplements of calcium and vitamin D compared to none (beta = 0.77), and having had Crohn’s disease (beta = 1.71) had significantly higher knowledge scores of osteoporosis; oppositely, having diabetes (beta = − 1.17), currently taking chemotherapy (beta = − 2.25), and ever having had a fracture (beta = − 0.74) were significantly correlated with lower awareness of osteoporosis. Conclusions Our findings suggest that the LOKS-19 can be used to measure knowledge of osteoporosis and help assess osteoporosis-related interventions. A better knowledge seems to be associated with more preventive measures and less risk of fracture.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

RESULTS Body dissatisfaction was positively correlated to restrained eating (r=0.293, P&lt;0.001), emotional eating (r=0.073, P=0.042) and binge eating (r=0.250, P&lt;0.001). The interaction between body dissatisfaction and gender was significantly associated with more restrained eating (Beta=0.01, P&lt;0.001) and orthorexia nervosa (Beta=-0.09, P&lt;0.001), but not with emotional (Beta=-0.43, P=0.103) and binge eating (Beta=-0.08, P=0.358). When stratifying the analysis by gender, the results revealed that higher body dissatisfaction was significantly associated with more restrained eating in both genders, but particularly among women. Body dissatisfaction was significantly associated with higher emotional eating in men only and with higher orthorexia nervosa tendencies and behaviors in females only. CONCLUSION The interaction between body dissatisfaction and gender was significantly associated with orthorexia nervosa and restrained eating but not with binge or emotional eating. Higher body dissatisfaction was significantly associated with higher restrained eating, more pronounced in women, while it was significantly associated with higher orthorexia tendencies (lower ORTO-15 scores) in women only. Body dissatisfaction was associated with emotional eating in men only.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Construction and validation of the Lebanese Osteoporosis Knowledge Scale among a representative sample of Lebanese womenOsteoporosis International,  2019Summary Our study aimed at constructing and validating the Lebanese Osteoporosis Knowledge Scale ... more Summary Our study aimed at constructing and validating the Lebanese Osteoporosis Knowledge Scale adapted for use among Lebanese women and to assess factors associated with the poorest knowledge of osteoporosis definition, risk factors, and preventive measures. This scale showed adequate psychometric properties; higher knowledge scores were reached in women who already heard about the disease and had a formal education. As a result, the LOKS-19 can be used to measure knowledge of osteoporosis and help assess osteoporosis-related interventions. Introduction The primary objective of this study was to describe the construction of the Lebanese Osteoporosis Knowledge Scale (LOKS) and assess its psychometric properties in a representative sample of Lebanese women aged 40 years and above. Secondary objectives were to explore factors associated with this knowledge score. Methods A cross-sectional study carried out between March and June 2018, enrolled 560 women over the age of 40 years living in the community. This proportionate sample was randomly selected from all Lebanese governorates to cover the entire Lebanese area. A survey was developed and adapted to the Lebanese population based on preexisting scales. Personal interviews were conducted to collect data. Results The items of the LOKS were distributed across seven factors with an Eigenvalue over 1 solution, outlining an overall value of 55.89% of the variance. A high Cronbach’s alpha was found for the full scale (0.725). Individuals having a university level of education (beta = 1.62; compared to illiteracy), having heard of osteoporosis (beta = 2.62), taking supplements of calcium and vitamin D compared to none (beta = 0.77), and having had Crohn’s disease (beta = 1.71) had significantly higher knowledge scores of osteoporosis; oppositely, having diabetes (beta = − 1.17), currently taking chemotherapy (beta = − 2.25), and ever having had a fracture (beta = − 0.74) were significantly correlated with lower awareness of osteoporosis. Conclusions Our findings suggest that the LOKS-19 can be used to measure knowledge of osteoporosis and help assess osteoporosis-related interventions. A better knowledge seems to be associated with more preventive measures and less risk of fracture.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
