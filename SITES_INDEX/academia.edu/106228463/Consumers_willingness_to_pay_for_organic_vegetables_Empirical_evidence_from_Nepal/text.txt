New pearl millet varieties (KAT/PM1, KAT/PM2 and KAT/PM3) were introduced in response to low yield and birds’ menace that was wiping out the traditional pearl millet varieties in Kenya. Despite this, limited information exists on consumers’ willingness to pay and the determinants of willingness to pay estimates for these newly introduced varieties products. This study was undertaken to analyze consumers’ willingness to pay and the determinants of willingness to pay estimates for these pearl millet products. Results showed that most consumers (70%) were willing to pay a premium price with the mean willingess to pay of 42% over finger millet market price. Age, number of children below 12 years in a household, gender of household head, income and awareness levels were the important factors that positively influenced consumers’ willingness to pay premium prices.

The standard economic approach to valuation was extended by including psychological factors. The results from the empirical model show that psychological factors (behavioural control, attitude and subjective norms) exerted more influence on consumersâ€™ WTP for organic products. In addition, socio-demographic factors such as gender, education, number of children in a household, high income and race, are statistically significant in explaining consumersâ€™ WTP for organic food. Policy implications for advancement and improved promotion, sales and consumption of organic food products were discussed.Download Free PDFView PDFWaterDo Consumers of Environmentally Friendly Farming Products in Downstream Areas Have a WTP for Water Quality Protection in Upstream Areas?2017 • Saem LeeDownload Free PDFView PDFAfrican Journal of Food, Agriculture, Nutrition and DevelopmentWillingness to pay for organic vegetables in Abeokuta, South West Nigeria2011 • Biola PhillipDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of food distribution researchFactors Affecting Consumers' Willingness to Pay for Certififed Organic Food Products in United Arab Emirates2015 • Eihab FathelrahmanOrganic food consumption is increasing among United Arab Emirates (UAE) consumers in the last few years.
