A Hoard of Silver Roman Coins from the Mining Areas of the Metalla Tricornensia: An Archaeological and Numismatic Study (in English and Serbian)The monetary find described in the monograph A Hoard of Roman Silver Coins From the Mining Area o... more The monetary find described in the monograph A Hoard of Roman Silver Coins From the Mining Area of Metalla Tricornensia. An archaeological and numismatic study, by Bojana Borić-Brešković and Adam N. Crnobrnja, was discovered by chance in the village of Mirosaljci, 40 km to the south of Belgrade in 1995 and, after members of the Ministry of the Interior had promptly intervened, it was deposited in the National Museum in Belgrade. Its  contents, 724 denarii of Rome and two drachmas of Lycia,minted in the period from the reign of Nero to that of Commodus, were examined from the archaeological, historical and numismatic aspects, with special emphasis on the spacial aspect of the find.The place where the coins were discovered, located on the fertile south-western slopes of the Parcanski Vis, in the border area of the provinces of Moesia Superior,Dalmatia and Pannonia Inferior, was the reason for a new analysis of the presumed directions of the borders and for reconsidering what is already known about the miningterritory on Mount Kosmaj, its organization and attribution to a particular province.In this light, proceeding from earlier assumptions based on epigraphic and, to a lesser extent, archaeological material, supplemented by new, primarily archaeologicaland topographic data, it emerged that the Kosmaj mines were located in the province of Moesia Superior and its metalla Tricornensia, and that the locality where the hoardwas discovered belonged to the territory of the imperial domain of the mining area of Kosmaj. Its position on the fertile southern slopes of the Parcanski Vis, favourable forworking the land, with a registered facility in the immediate vicinity, and significant evidence as to the presence of settlements in the surrounding area, defined the agrarian character of the entire area, which supplied the numerous population of this mining area with wheat and other foodstuffs.On the basis of an exhaustive analysis of the hoard, it was shown that the main part of the find was formed during the 2nd century, during the reign of Antoninus Pius and,especially, Marcus Aurelius, exactly at the time when the exploitation of silver-bearing lead ore was intensified and when it was at its peak. With Commodus, the inflow ofcoins in the hoard became very sporadic and one denarius belonging to him, dated to the period from January 1st to July, 192 AD, determined the terminus a quo of its burial.The most probable cause for this was economic instability which, besides local trouble or reasons of an entirely personal nature, could have been caused by Commodus’ internal policy, which was particularly unpopular towards the end of his life and reign.Although the Kosmaj mines were in an administratively separate territory and had special economic status, they could not have remained isolated from the influence ofthe rest of the province. Commodus’ repressive measures regarding taxation and fees were thus identified as being one of the possible causes for insecurity and destabilisation in the area of the Kosmaj mines, which did not necessarily have to leave a trace in written sources.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It belongs among the earliest cities in Europe, the thread of urban life running uninterrupted for more than two thousand years. The pages of its history have been written by many cultures, civilizations and state formations, and all of them left a trace behind: streets, buildings, cemeteries – we keep discovering them; relics of the material culture – we keep gathering andprotecting them from complete ruin and oblivion.Money has also survived. In the past 160 years since the beginning of the more or less regular recording of archaeological finds from Belgrade and its environs, a wealth of old coins has been discovered. From onepiece to another, the reader of this book will not only gain an insight into the two-millennium-long history of this city but also into the beauty of metallic and paper money circulating in the land between the Savaand Danube rivers over the centuries.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Papers - NeolithicVinča Bowls with Protoma/Vinčanske zdele sa protomama (in Serbian, summary in English)by Adam Crnobrnja and Miloš SpasićStarinar 64, 185-203,  2014Bowls with protoma appear in almost all regions of the central Balkans populated by Vinča culture... more Bowls with protoma appear in almost all regions of the central Balkans populated by Vinča culture communities and we do not note them in the areas of the neighbouring Late Neolithic communities. These bowls appear in a very long and clearly defined time span and their usage lasts for exactly the same time as the Vinča culture itself, appearing at the same time and together disappearing. The first vessels with their protoma facing the inside, appear almost synchronously at the very beginning of the Vin~a culture, that is the Late Neolithic of the Balkans, in the centre of its area (Vinča and Grivac), but also in its furthermost peripheral areas (Röszke-Lúdvár and Anza). Their abrupt disappearance, together withthe disappearance of the Vinča culture, that is to say the LateNeolithic way of living, should not be surprising. The changethat comes along with the abandonment of the last Vinča settlements is not only perceptible in the material culture, but also, and above all, in the social system and the organisation of the community. Fundamental changes in the social structure in the middle of the 5th millennium BC, evidently led to the downfall and disappearance of many deep-rooted values of the communities of that time, as well as the very system of beliefs and sagas. This resulted in the disappearance of the vessels with protoma’s utilisation, one of the most steadfast material manifestations of the Vinča culture.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Extensive geophysical investigations were carried out during the 2010 campaign and, based on the results, we started investigations of the Late Vin~a house 01/2010. The following comprehensive report details the method of construction and organisation of life in that house, which dates from the Vinca culture phase D. The house was very well preserved and we paid special attention to two large ovens inside the house as well as to some interesting portable finds (a clay table, a clay millstone structure and three large clay heads).Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The distinctiveness of this find is that it was discovered in it original context, where the figurines were used, and that the objects were found in their original arrangement. I also discuss to what extent it is possible, considering the figurines arrangement, to understand hints of social structure and organisation of communities in the final phase of Vinca culture. KEY WORDS – Vinca culture; Late Neolithic; figurines; settlements; social structureSave to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

What was their purpose? Were they autonomous or part of some wider communities? How large was the territory within which people of that time defined themselves as ‘we’ and where did communities of ‘others’ begin? The objective of this work is to indicate the possibilities for studying the complexity of group identities in the Late Vinca societies. We take as a starting point the micro-region of Drenski Vis in north-western Serbia, where five Late Vinca settlements have been discovered."Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Circulation of Coinage from the Bithynian Mint of Nicaea in the Territory of Present day Serbiaby Adam Crnobrnja and Mirjana VojvodaProceedings of the International Numismatic Symposium Circulation of the Antique Coins in Southeastern Europe, Viminacium, Serbia, September 15th - 16th 2017,  2018Systematic excavations in the municipium of Brigetio have been carried out since 1992. More than ... more Systematic excavations in the municipium of Brigetio have been carried out since 1992. More than twenty years of research have yielded sufficient numismatic material to analyze monetary circulation of one of the most important cities on the Pannonian limes. The coin finds cover a time span from end of the 2nd to the middle of the 3rd century, which is not surprising in itself. It is interesting to observe the end of circulation, with a complete lack of coins of Valerian and Gallienus, otherwise so numerous elsewhere.Another interesting fact is the absence of any destruction layer whatsoever. Monetary circulation withinthe municipium is in strong contrast to a coin hoard found nearby and also ending in the middle of the 3rdcentury. However, this unexplained abrupt break in the monetary circulation seems not to be just of localcharacter, but a rather widespread sensation that led to a considerable reshaping of civil settlements in thenorth of the provinceSave to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
A Hoard of Tetradrachmae of Phillip II and Their Barbaric Imitations from Ušće near Obrenovac (2) (in Serbian, summary in English)Numizmatičar 36,  2018In this paper, new information is published about the hoard which contained tetradrachmae of Phil... more In this paper, new information is published about the hoard which contained tetradrachmae of Philip II and their early imitations, some of which have already been published (Crnobrnja 2012). Thanks to an acquisition by the National Museum in Belgrade and gaining insight into a private collection, on this occasion we are publishing data about 33 new specimens from that hoard. The paper also provides an integral presentation of the preserved part of the hoard (a total of 78 specimens published in this and the previous paper, Table 1). New data about the appearance of the vessel in which the hoard was found (the situla with handles with attachments in the shape of lions’ heads) are an additional indicator of the possibility that early imitations of the tetradrachmae of Philip II in this hoard (Crnobrnja 2012, cat. No. 43-45; in this paper cat. No. 32 and 33) were minted either in the zone of contact between Macedonia and Thracia, or in the area between Mount Stara Planina and the Carpathian mountains.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
New finds of coins from the Nicaea mint in Bithynia in the territory of the City of Belgrade (in Serbian, summary in English)by Adam Crnobrnja and jelena A Vasic DerimanovicThis work deals with 93 specimens of coins from the Nicaea mint in Bithynia that were discovered ... more This work deals with 93 specimens of coins from the Nicaea mint in Bithynia that were discovered in the territory of the present-day city of Belgrade, which arrived in museum collections by way of acquisitions in the past few years. Of this number, 79 specimens are from the Numismatic Collection of the City of Belgrade Museum and 14 are from the Numismatic Collection of the National Museum in Belgrade.The fact that the location of the discovery for each specimen is known is of particular value. Fifty-eight (among them, two minted for Iulia Mamea) belong to thecoinage of Alexander Severus, and 35 specimens, to the coinage of Gordianus III.Nine new variants of reverse images were noted as bearing military signs (Fig. 1), and there was a curiosity in the form of one tiny coin of Alexander Severus, thereverse of which was partly re-minted using an obverse die (cat. 26).The second part of the paper gives a presentation of all the so far documented finds of coins from the Nicaea mint in the territory of Belgrade, of which there are 171,discovered on 18 archaeological sites (Table 2). The majority of hitherto finds in the territory of Belgrade originated from the south-eastern part of the province ofLower Pannonia (163 pieces), whereas only 8 specimens were found in the territory of the province of Upper Moesia. The largest concentration of finds was recorded on the Ušće archaeological site, in the Roman municipium of Spodent […], where 112 specimens of the coins of Nicaea were unearthed, in other words, 65.5%of all the specimens in the territory of Belgrade. The archaeological finds indicate that in the first half of the 3rd century, besides coins of the Bithynian mint of Nicaea, a new population from the East began settling in the regions of Upper Moesia and the south-eastern part of Lower Pannonia, bringing with them new cults andnew iconographic forms. Such abrupt changes observed in the archaeological record point to a complex process that unfolded between our soil and the East, and so one should perhaps also seek the immediate reasons for the appearance of large quantities of coins from the Nicaea mint in Bithynia.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Extensive geophysical investigations were carried out during the 2010 campaign and, based on the results, we started investigations of the Late Vin~a house 01/2010. The following comprehensive report details the method of construction and organisation of life in that house, which dates from the Vinca culture phase D. The house was very well preserved and we paid special attention to two large ovens inside the house as well as to some interesting portable finds (a clay table, a clay millstone structure and three large clay heads).Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The distinctiveness of this find is that it was discovered in it original context, where the figurines were used, and that the objects were found in their original arrangement. I also discuss to what extent it is possible, considering the figurines arrangement, to understand hints of social structure and organisation of communities in the final phase of Vinca culture. KEY WORDS – Vinca culture; Late Neolithic; figurines; settlements; social structureSave to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

What was their purpose? Were they autonomous or part of some wider communities? How large was the territory within which people of that time defined themselves as ‘we’ and where did communities of ‘others’ begin? The objective of this work is to indicate the possibilities for studying the complexity of group identities in the Late Vinca societies. We take as a starting point the micro-region of Drenski Vis in north-western Serbia, where five Late Vinca settlements have been discovered."Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Vinca Culture Settlement at Crkvine In Stubline: Household Organization and Urbanization In the Late Vinca Culture Periodby Adam Crnobrnja and Marko A.

In the first section of this work we present the comprehensive report about the investigations carried out so far. The geomagnetic prospection undertaken from 2006 to 2008 covered an area of 32,400 square meters and the obtained results indicate the existence of around 100 houses built in rows around the rather large open areas as well as the trenches surrounding the settlement. The investigations of the house 1/2008 dating from the Vinca culture D–2 period yielded in addition to the data concerning its interior organization also a unique find of the group of 46 figurines with 11 models of miniature tools. In the second section of this work we discuss the prospects, which future investigations of this site and its environment could provide concerning the study of the social organization in the very end of the Vinca culture.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Circulation of Coinage from the Bithynian Mint of Nicaea in the Territory of Present day Serbiaby Adam Crnobrnja and Mirjana VojvodaProceedings of the International Numismatic Symposium Circulation of the Antique Coins in Southeastern Europe, Viminacium, Serbia, September 15th - 16th 2017,  2018Systematic excavations in the municipium of Brigetio have been carried out since 1992. More than ... more Systematic excavations in the municipium of Brigetio have been carried out since 1992. More than twenty years of research have yielded sufficient numismatic material to analyze monetary circulation of one of the most important cities on the Pannonian limes. The coin finds cover a time span from end of the 2nd to the middle of the 3rd century, which is not surprising in itself. It is interesting to observe the end of circulation, with a complete lack of coins of Valerian and Gallienus, otherwise so numerous elsewhere.Another interesting fact is the absence of any destruction layer whatsoever. Monetary circulation withinthe municipium is in strong contrast to a coin hoard found nearby and also ending in the middle of the 3rdcentury. However, this unexplained abrupt break in the monetary circulation seems not to be just of localcharacter, but a rather widespread sensation that led to a considerable reshaping of civil settlements in thenorth of the provinceSave to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
A Hoard of Tetradrachmae of Phillip II and Their Barbaric Imitations from Ušće near Obrenovac (2) (in Serbian, summary in English)Numizmatičar 36,  2018In this paper, new information is published about the hoard which contained tetradrachmae of Phil... more In this paper, new information is published about the hoard which contained tetradrachmae of Philip II and their early imitations, some of which have already been published (Crnobrnja 2012). Thanks to an acquisition by the National Museum in Belgrade and gaining insight into a private collection, on this occasion we are publishing data about 33 new specimens from that hoard. The paper also provides an integral presentation of the preserved part of the hoard (a total of 78 specimens published in this and the previous paper, Table 1). New data about the appearance of the vessel in which the hoard was found (the situla with handles with attachments in the shape of lions’ heads) are an additional indicator of the possibility that early imitations of the tetradrachmae of Philip II in this hoard (Crnobrnja 2012, cat. No. 43-45; in this paper cat. No. 32 and 33) were minted either in the zone of contact between Macedonia and Thracia, or in the area between Mount Stara Planina and the Carpathian mountains.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
New finds of coins from the Nicaea mint in Bithynia in the territory of the City of Belgrade (in Serbian, summary in English)by Adam Crnobrnja and jelena A Vasic DerimanovicThis work deals with 93 specimens of coins from the Nicaea mint in Bithynia that were discovered ... more This work deals with 93 specimens of coins from the Nicaea mint in Bithynia that were discovered in the territory of the present-day city of Belgrade, which arrived in museum collections by way of acquisitions in the past few years. Of this number, 79 specimens are from the Numismatic Collection of the City of Belgrade Museum and 14 are from the Numismatic Collection of the National Museum in Belgrade.The fact that the location of the discovery for each specimen is known is of particular value. Fifty-eight (among them, two minted for Iulia Mamea) belong to thecoinage of Alexander Severus, and 35 specimens, to the coinage of Gordianus III.Nine new variants of reverse images were noted as bearing military signs (Fig. 1), and there was a curiosity in the form of one tiny coin of Alexander Severus, thereverse of which was partly re-minted using an obverse die (cat. 26).The second part of the paper gives a presentation of all the so far documented finds of coins from the Nicaea mint in the territory of Belgrade, of which there are 171,discovered on 18 archaeological sites (Table 2). The majority of hitherto finds in the territory of Belgrade originated from the south-eastern part of the province ofLower Pannonia (163 pieces), whereas only 8 specimens were found in the territory of the province of Upper Moesia. The largest concentration of finds was recorded on the Ušće archaeological site, in the Roman municipium of Spodent […], where 112 specimens of the coins of Nicaea were unearthed, in other words, 65.5%of all the specimens in the territory of Belgrade. The archaeological finds indicate that in the first half of the 3rd century, besides coins of the Bithynian mint of Nicaea, a new population from the East began settling in the regions of Upper Moesia and the south-eastern part of Lower Pannonia, bringing with them new cults andnew iconographic forms. Such abrupt changes observed in the archaeological record point to a complex process that unfolded between our soil and the East, and so one should perhaps also seek the immediate reasons for the appearance of large quantities of coins from the Nicaea mint in Bithynia.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
An Unknown Imitation of the Roman Republican Denarius from Svrljig (Serbia) (in Serbian, summary in English)The coin described in this paper was discovered by chance on the hill of Oblik beside the Stari G... more The coin described in this paper was discovered by chance on the hill of Oblik beside the Stari Grad Svrljig fortification (the village of Bašta in the vicinity of Svrljig), and it is the property of the Homeland Museum Collection in Svrljig (fig. 1; fig. 3/1). It is one of the rare copies of Roman republican denarii that originate from Serbia with a reliably established place of discovery. The denarius itself is very interesting, because it represents a so far unknown variant of counterfeit Roman  republican money. The obverse type on our coin belongs to the original coinage of S. Mamilius Limetanus from 82 BC. The obverse representation with Mercury appears very rarely on forgeries of Roman republican denarii. On our specimen, the image of Mercury was very carefully produced and its appearance bears a much closer resemblance to the original coinage. The representation is poorly preserved because the silver coating was worn away from most of the surface, and the relief on the bronze core of the coin was worn down. The weight of the coin is 2.27 gr. and the diameter is 18 mm. On theobverse is an image of Victoria in a quadriga, holding a wreath, which is the typical reverse representation on the money of Q. Antoninus Balbus. The inscription on the reverse of our coin, one can see, is inaccurately imitated and poorly forged (I ANTOBAV - A, N and T are in a ligature, while the V at the end can actually be assumed to be a rotated L), and it was found on the original coinage of the coin-producer Q. Antoninus Balbus, from 83-82 BC.Several facts prove that this coin is a forgery: the coin is made of bronze coated in silver; the weight of the coin is far below the standard weight of Roman republicandenarii; the inscription on the reverse is imprecise; the obverse and reverse belong to different coin-producers (it is a so-called hybrid). The reverse, identical to the one on our coin, is also to be found on one more ancient hybrid forgery with silver coasting which is kept in a private collection in North America, but the coinage of C. Claudius Pulcher was used as the template for the obverse of that coin (fig. 2). The production date of our coin can be chronologically determined in the middle and the second half of the 1st century BC.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Finds of Roman coins from the archaeological excavations in 1967, at the locality Ušće near Obrenovac (minicipium Spodent?) (in Serbian, summary in English)Numizmatičar 31, Beograd 2013, 197-238This paper discusses the finds of coins, originating from the archaeological explorations of a Ro... more This paper discusses the finds of coins, originating from the archaeological explorations of a Roman settlement near the village of Ušće on the bank of the River Sava, performed in 1967. This settlement can be identified with great reliability as the Roman municipium Spodent (…), a town at the mid-point between the water route and the southern land route between Sirmium and Singidunum, which was located in the province of Lower Pannonia. The finds of coins testify to the long continuity of habitation in this place during Antiquity, from the start of the 3rd century BC, to the start of the 5th century AD. One may conclude on the basis of surface finds of Roman provenance that the total area occupied by the settlement and its  necropoles was between 70 and 120 hectares. During these archaeological explorations,116 specimens of Roman coins was found, spanning the period from Claudius I to Valens, and they are catalogued in this paper. Earlier published individual finds of money from the same locality were also taken into consideration, for the sake of a better understanding of the circulation of money. Among the 1,382 coins collected in this way, there are pieces bearing the images of 70 rulers and members of their families, and certain regular patterns, which can be expected for these periods, were observed on examining the frequency of coins from particular periods. The composition of the finds of coins from archaeological excavations in 1967 is particularly interesting. Bronze nominals were dominant among the coins of the 2nd and 3rd century, which is an indication of the lively activity in this settlement, and of the high frequency of provincial coinage amongthe coins belonging to the second quarter of the 3rd century. Attention should also be drawn to the fact that the analysis of the coins indicated the likelihood that most of the published coins from Ušće, which belonged to the 4th century, originated from scattered hoards, which may have been linked with the uncertain times that prevailed in 374/375, with the incursions by the Quadi and the Sarmati into Pannonia, and in the year 378, with the raids by the Goths, which were also registered in the immediate neighbourhood. Unfortunately, the failure to adequately protect the Roman settlement at Ušće resulted in its almost complete devastation. And so, we can now research the life of this settlement during the Roman period only by examining the small portion of preserved movable finds. For the present, the coins that were in circulation in the settlement remain the most reliable source for studying the events of that period.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
A Hoard of Tetradrachmae of Phillip II and Their Barbaric Imitations from Ušće near Obrenovac (in Serbian, summary in English)Остава тетрадрахми Филипа II и њихових варварских имитација из Ушћа код Обреновца, Нумизматичар 32, Београд 2014,  7-29.,  Dec 30, 2014At the end of 2012, illegal diggers with metal detectors discovered a hoard of tetradrachmae of P... more At the end of 2012, illegal diggers with metal detectors discovered a hoard of tetradrachmae of Philip II and their early imitations, at a depth of 0.8-1.2 metres, on the well-known ancient archaeological site of Ušće near Obrenovac (the right bank of the Sava river, about 50 km west of Belgrade). The hoard consisted of 532 coins, deposited in a bronze vessel, decorated with relief presentations and, according to the finders, it contained only silver tetradrachmae of Philip II and a small number of their imitations. Soon after discovery, the hoard was dispersed and, in this paper, I covered 45 specimens from private collections, the composition of which corresponds to the description of the overall composition of the hoard.The earliest specimen in the preserved part of the hoard was minted in Pella between 354/3 and 349/8 BC. After that, the tetradrachmae were minted in Amphipolis between 384/7 and 343/2 BC, while two coins from Pella and one from Amphipolis belong to the final years of Philip’s reign (342/1-337/6 BC). The majority of coins, a total of 34, belong to the posthumous coinage of tetradrachmae of Philip II. Of these, 14 pieces originate from the period between 323/2-316/5 BC and 20 from the period 315/4-295/4 (BC). Three tetradrachmae belong to the earliest Celtic imitations of money of Philip II, although it is possible that some of the coins which I determined as originals  are also faithful copies of Philip’s money.I proposed the period between 180 and 250 BC as the time frame in which our hoard was deposited. It must be noted that the hoard from Ušće has no analogy on our soil in terms of its composition, and that it is the northernmost hoard that can be dated inthis period.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

A. D. Existance of another, earlier edict on religious tolerance, which was enacted in 261. A. D by King Galien, is mostly neglected. Having in mind the existence of dilema, which is present in literature more then a century, that there is a possibility that queen Salonine, wife of king Galien, was a christian, makes the whole matter even more interesting.In this work, special atention was refered to latest data given by study of Empress Salonines coinage, especialy an explicit representation of cross on one of the coins, as well as the presence of Plotin on royal court in attempt to give an answernot only on the question of Empress Salonines religious orientation, but, most of all, on a new aspect of Plotins philosophy interpretation. That is why we confronted data about Plotin’s position on the court of Emperor Galien and Empress Salonine, his philosophy, coin with cross representation whichpoints to possibility that Salonine was a christian, as well as the circumstances in which Plotin’s work came to us(in Porfi rys reduction, for whom there is a reference that he was big opponent of christians). As a daring presupposition, instead of conclusion, a question is imposed, was Plotin only a role model to later christian fathers or true early christian philosopher?Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Spatha from the Province Pannonia Secunda with Marks of Workshop and Military UnitZbornik Narodnog muzeja (Beograd),  2019Long sword, spatha was discovered as chance find in the area of the village Ratari near Obrenovac... more Long sword, spatha was discovered as chance find in the area of the village Ratari near Obrenovac. Location where the spatha was found is at the bank of former Velika Bara, an old arm of the Sava River. It is assumed that the road, which in the Roman times was running along the right bank of the Sava from Sirmium via Spodent (…) to Singidunum, was about one kilometer to the north of the spot where the spatha was found. On the spatha there are marks stamped on both sides of the blade.Stamp EX B NAISS probably marks the place of manufacture also being the confirmation of more than hundred years old assumption about the existence of fabrica armorum in Naissus. Existence of fabrica armorum has not been ascertained so far neither archaeologically nor epigraphically, so the stamp on this spatha is first genuine confirmation of such activities besides mentioning of the workshop of unspecified character in the Notitia Dignitatum. In addition, that inscription on the stamp on the spatha provides important information about the organization of activities in the imperial workshops. Mark B on the stamp indicates that spatha was made in second officina of the section for weaponry production in Naissus.Stamp IOVIANA on the other side of the blade denotes by all appearances the army unit for which it had been forged. Use of the formulation Ioviana has not been registered so far on the epigraphic monuments and in literary sources. It remains an open question whether Ioviana relates to legio V Ioviana (as alteration of the name Iovia) or to some unit from the corpus numero Iovianorum. There is an assumption suggested that removing the spatha from use could be associated with the Licinius’ flight after the battle of Cibalae in 316 as he was retreating from Sirmium via Spodent towards Singidunum along the route to the south of the Sava river.Morphological traits date the spatha to the 3rd century and stamps on it suggest the very end of the 3rd century or the beginning of the 4th century. Possible connecting of its use for a single specific event (flight of Licinius) looks tempting, but such assumption should be taken with considerable reservation. Most important values provided by the chance find of this spatha could be considered the unique data obtained by the stamps on its blade about military unit for which it had been produced and about the activity of fabrica armorum in Naissus.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

У раду се разматрају места на којима се жишци на иконама приказују, симболика најнижег регистра у коме се они по правилу налазе, као и разлика у приказима лампи на канделабрима и самостално стојећих жижака, те могућности њихове различите симболике. На основу превасходно хтонског карактера најнижег регистра икона, као и резултата досадашњих истраживања о намени жижака на нашем тлу, аутори износе претпоставку да се може размишљати о тумачењу те композиције као евентуално схематизоване и симболичке представе финалних (загробних) ритуала у животном циклусу припадника овог загонетног култа. Кључне речи: оловне иконе, култ подунавских коњаника, лампе, римски период Abstract: The paper deals with the images of lamps in the icons showing the Danubian horseman. The most common places in which oils lamps were depicted in icons, the symbolism of the lowest tier where they are usually placed, the difference between representations of lamps on candelabra and free-standing oil lamps, as well as the possibilities for a different symbolic interpretation have also been discussed. Having in mind the prevailingly chthonic character of the lowest tier of icons and the results of recent research on the function of oil lamps in this region, the authors put forward the hypothesis that such images could be interpreted as schematic and symbolic representations of the final (funerary) rituals in the life cycle of members of this mysterious cult. Представама на жишцима до сада је посвећено више радова у којима је, између осталог, разматрана и њихова симболика 1.

Имајући у виду такво стање, у овом раду кренули смо од могућности супротне претпоставке, односно разматрања о томе може ли нам присуство жижака на одређеном месту помоћи да протумачимо сам контекст налаза или њиховог ликовног приказа?

REVISED ARCHAEOLOGICAL FIELD SURVEY OF THE CORE ZONE OF THE KOSMAJ MINES (in Serbian, summary in English)Zbornik Narodnog muzeja - Beograd XXIII-1 arheologija,  2017The paper provides a review of the revised archaeological field survey of the core zone of the Ro... more The paper provides a review of the revised archaeological field survey of the core zone of the Roman mining area between the villages of Guberevac, Stojnik, Babe and Parcani. The Roman mines in this area were the most important sources of lead and silver in the area of metalla Tricornensia, one of the four mining territories in Moesia Superior within the metalla Moesiae Superioris.After reviewing the available data that originates from the Kosmaj mining area, preserved documentation from the explorations and published material, we realised that in order to understand this complex area it was necessary to resort to new, more extensive archaeologicalfield survey. A significant number of registered and excavated archaeological sites had no precise data about their locations, and it is impossible to consider the spatial organisation of the mining area without that category of data.Because of the above said, we have decided to continue, after an almost three-decade long pause, the field archaeological explorations of the Kosmaj mining area, the first phase of which was new archaeological field survey. Based on the consideration of the spatial distributionof the registered Roman sites, the character of movable finds and papers about the organisation of the Roman mining areas, we divided the Kosmaj mining area into three parts: 1) military fortification with the central mining settlement, 2) core zone of the mines, 3) broader zone of the mines. During the revised field survey that has been performed so far, we directed our attention to accomplishing two goals. The first was to precisely locate the already registered archaeological sites, with the aim of establishing their current condition, to assess their exploration potential and secure sufficient data to create a report for declaringthe site a cultural monument. The second goal was to inspect as much of the mining area as possible, to gain an insight into its state of preservation and whether it was in jeopardy, and to collect data needed for planning further systematic field survey. Newly discovered siteswere also registered during this process. Because of limitations regarding the length of this paper, described are only the sites from the core zone of the mine area: the military fortification, the zone of the civilian settlement, certain buildings from the Roman period and theexploitation zone (slag deposits, pinges, mineshafts). Particular attention was paid to establishing the shape of the Roman castel in Gradište (a polygonal shape with a circumference of around 600 m, with a ‘small town’ within it, on an oval elevation with a diameter of 55 m,surrounded by a trench), and all the existing and newly registered mineshafts (Table 1, six existing and five newly registered mineshafts). Besides a critical review of the existing studies of this area and a warning about the intense devastation of the archaeological sites, thepaper provides basic guidelines for further investigation and protection treatment of the Roman mining complex.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Special attention has been paid to the rarely considered aspects related to these objects: the spatial context of the finds and the manner in which they were used. So far, 77 lead icons of Danubian horsemen that come from the southeastern part of the province of Lower Pannonia, i.e. the areas of Syrmia, Mačva and lower Posavina (the agri of the colonies of Sirmium and Bassiana and the municipium of Spodent...), have been published, which, with the new finds, constitutes a corpus of 85 objects, with the find location established for 59 of them. Based on field prospection results on other archaeological traces and certain zones whitin the sites, we have attempted to determine the more precise finding context of the icons (settlements, necropoles, military forts), which, in our opinion, represents an important contribution to the further study of this mysterious cult. It has been established that the largest number of them were found within settlements (40 icons at 28 sites), followed by graves or necropolises (14 icons at 7 sites), while the least number of them were found at sites related to the military (5 pieces at 5 sites). Bearing in mind the data published in a study by D. Tudor which emphasise a military context, we may say that the results of our investigation place emphasis on the “civilian” context in its broadest sense. Even though we do not controvert the numerous earlier views that military units were the primary carriers of the cult of the Danubian horsemen, we believe that the information we have collected indicates that the cult easily found its adherents among various layers of the population and that it must have been based on certain universal values, on an appealing sacral ideology that was close to the heart not only of the military, but the civilian population as well. Finally, on the example of one of a partially preserved icon from Ušće near Obrenovac, which is actually a carefully cut off quarter of a lead tablet with a small hole for hanging, we indicate that it may have been worn as an amulet. This kind of adaptation of icons is so far unique and represents a rare guideline for studying the manner in which these objects were used in Antiquity.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Brick with the stamp Legio I Noricorum from Ušće near Obrenovac (in Serbian, summary in English)by Adam Crnobrnja and Deana  RatkovicFinds of Roman bricks with a stamp are important for studying the movements of Roman military uni... more Finds of Roman bricks with a stamp are important for studying the movements of Roman military units, as well as of the  Roman economy. A brick with the stamp of a military unit was found in the area of the village of Beljina, at the Graduština site, on the left side of the place where the Vukodraž brook empties into the Sava River. Registered at the site was the existence of a fort and a settlement and, in close proximity to it, around a hundred metres away, on the right bank of the Vukodraž, there is the Ušće site, which sprawls over 70 hectares. The two sites constitute a complex of around 120 hectares, which may be identified as the Roman municipium Spodent[ ], situated in the province of Lower Pannonia (Pannonia Inferior), later called Second Pannonia (Pannonia Secunda). It is evident that this was a rather important settlement at an intersection of the road and the waterway between Sirmium and Singidunum. The inscription on the stamp found on the brick reads: FIGVLINASIVENSIANAS LEG I NOR. The brick also contains the footprint of a barefoot child no more than five years of age.The brick with the stamp of the legion I Noricorum, formed in the late 3rd century by Diocletian for the purpose of defending the frontiers on the Danube in Noricum, with permanent camps at Mautern (Faviana) and Wallsee (Ad Iuvense) in Austria. Bricks with the stamp of the unit with the full text Figulinas Ivensianas Leg I Nor have been found at mutually rather distant places along waterways, most commonly in forts and settlements along the Danube and the Sava, in the provinces of Noricum (Faviana, Asturis), Pannonia Prima (Rajka in Hungary), and Pannonia Secunda (Cornacum, Cuccium, Sirmium). This type of inscription is dated to the first decades of the 4th century. The bricks of the legion I Noricorum were produced by the Figulinas Ivensianas workshop at Ad Iuvense. The locations of the finds ofbricks with the stamp Figulinas Ivensianas Leg I Nor along the banks of the Danube and the Sava suggest that the bricks were probably transported along the waterways. However, given the distance to be covered from Ad Iuvense to Ušće or Sirmium (over 1,000 km), such an assumption is questionable. This leads to the assumption that, instead of transporting bricks over hundreds or even thousands of kilometres, which was uneconomical, brick-makers, rather than finished products, were sent to help build military infrastructure by establishingnew brickworks at suitable places. The brick-makers brought with them the stamps of their original workshops and performed their duties in local brickworks. This is further s supported by the fact that brick-making workshops/kilns have been discovered along the Sava: at Sirmium, Vranje near Hrtkovci, and Progar.(Opeka sa žigom Legio I Noricorum iz Ušća kod Obrenovca)Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Furthermore, the analysis of nds directly suggesting that veterans were  settled in the site of Ušće and its vicinity, especially during the reign of the Severan dynasty (which is at the same time the period of the greatest expansion of the cult of Serapis), also raises possibility that the owner of this votive relief might have originated from military circles. Judging from the nding  place, but also taking into consideration the very shape of this object, it may be deduced that its  probable function was connected with funerary context, i. e., with the role of Serapis in the afterlife.Key words:Serapis, cult, Roman period, Severan dynasty, funerary context, Pannonia InferiorSave to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The settlement at Ušće near Obrenovac which with nearby fortification and the necropoles covers an area of over 70 hectares is considered the largest Roman settlement in that province to the south of the Sava river. This settlement was situated on two important roads in the Roman times, on the land road Sirmium – Singidunum and on the bank of the Sava river, which was important waterway. Large number of Roman settlements in the Sava valley tells about intensive life in the given period and suggests the existenceof an administrative center to which they all gravitated, while theinscription from Krušedol indicates that municipium Spodent( ) was almost certainly located in that area. After considering the date, position and size of the settlement at Ušće as well as other Roman sites in its vicinity the assumption was suggested that just this settlement could be municipium Spodent( ).Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

As the area where statio Confluentes is presumed to have been was devastated more than once in the past, confirmation can only be looked for in cartographic sources, and therefore plans and maps of the 17th to 19th centuries have been looked up. These data narrow the search to a limited area at thevery confluence of the two rivers. The exact location of statio Confluentes requires further and more thorough research into the land and river communications connecting Sirmium and Singidunum. The former brook Galovica (Dunavac) stands out as an important waterway used for shallow-draught navigation until the middle of the 19th century.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Cat. No. 1 and la represent a military belt buckle discovered in the village of Usće near Obrenovac. This type of buckles (Gala) belonged to the soldiers of Illyrian diecesus and is characteristic for the provinces on the Danube and in the Balkans (H.W. Böhme, Jahrbuch des Römisch-Germanischen Zentralmuseums Mainz 33, Jahrgang 1986, Teil 2, 4822). Böhme places them to the period from 340 to 380. On the basis of the material which accompanied the find of the buckle on Usce (fibula, medical and measuring instruments), and by analogy from other areas the author dates this buckle to the end of the 3rd and the first half of the 4th century. Buckles Cat. No. 2 (Zemun Polje, grave inventory) and Cat. No. 3 (found in the village of Usće near Obrenovac) belong to the same type of buckles with strenthening and triangular strap-end made in the technique of casting with fracturing. On the basis of the accompanying material from the grave unit (Cat. No. 2), the author dates them to the middle, that is to the second half of the 4th century. Early Medieval buckle (Cat. No. 4, purchase from Ritopek) shows the continuation of the tradition of manufacture of Late-classical buckles of the type which includes the buckles Cat. No. 2 and 3 described in this paper. Early Medieval buckle (Cat. No. 4) which had the extended use as a fibula is dated by the author to the 7th - 9th century.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Podizanje svesti o značaju arheološkog nasleđa /Raising Awareness of the Importance of Archaeological Heritage (in Serbian, summary in English)Moderna konzervacija,  2019Raising Awareness of the Importance of Archaeological Heritage
Considering the vulnerability of ... more Raising Awareness of the Importance of Archaeological HeritageConsidering the vulnerability of archaeological heritage, the Serbian Archaeological Society has launched theproject Raising Awareness of the Importance of Archaeological Heritage, whose implementation was financially supported by the Ministry of Culture and Information in 2017, 2018 and 2019. This paper provides a brief overview of the project’s implementation and its effects to date, as well as plans for future activities of the Serbian Archaeological Society in this field. The goal of the project is to start working towards a more comprehensive awareness raising campaign on the importance of preservation of archaeological heritage through cooperation with decision-makers and professional agencies at local level, as well as with relevant museums. Primary target groups included the following: decision-makers in local self-government units, professional agencies (urban planning and construction, construction inspection services, tourism, culture), the police, courts, prosecutor’s offices, school representatives. Over the course of three years there were 33 presentations in 30 cities across Serbia,which received media coverage in about 150 reports. The representatives of the target groups were acquainted with the working processes in archaeology, specificities of archaeological heritage, international conventions, legislation, frameworks and procedural possibilities for their active participation in the processes of protection, conservation, promotion and use of archaeological heritage. The presentations emphasised concrete examples of potential threatsto archaeological heritage due to the lack of information and/or lack of communication with the agencies providing protection, but there were also concrete examples showing that local authorities within their mandates can have a significant impact on providing more adequate protection of archaeological heritage. Initial steps were taken even during the very implementation of the project in order to create cross-sectoral linkages in local self-government units with the aim of protecting archaeological heritage. The attitude of the wider community to archaeological heritage may be greatly improved through raising awareness of the importance of archaeological heritage, learning about regulations and procedures and pointing to good and bad examples.Besides direct follow-up with local self-government  units, plans for the forthcoming period include the publication of the Handbook on the Protection of Archaeological Heritage, providing detailed advice and instructions and possible action points regarding protection and ways of engaging archaeological heritage in sustainable development of local communities. The publishing of the Handbook will give a new lease of life to the project and ensure accessibility of its results to the largest number of future eneficiaries. The other course of action will be focused on training junior colleagues and students on procedures and ways of reporting illegal archaeological investigations and earthworks which damage archaeological sites, as well as on monitoring the drawing up of planning documentsand taking action in the event of inept handling of archaeological heritage. As a result, there will be more trained individuals who will be able to take an active part in the prevention and protection of archaeological heritage.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Arheolosko nasledje u Srbiji danas: briga države ili posao entuzijasta (in Serbian, summary in English)Moderna konzervacija (Beograd),  2017The Current Archaeological Heritage of Serbia: The Responsibility of the State or Enthusiasts?
... more The Current Archaeological Heritage of Serbia: The Responsibility of the State or Enthusiasts? Any activity resulting in partial or complete destruction of an archaeological environment may be regarded as destruction of archaeological heritage. Sadly enough, a host of unfortunate circumstances in Serbia have provided fertile ground for the destruction of its archaeological heritage. This paper sheds light on a number of aspects regarding the ways in which Serbia’s archaeological heritage is being destroyed and endangered:- Organised looting of sites by rogue prospectors. The activities of rogue prospectors who devastate hundreds of archaeological sites each year is just one of the notorious examples.- Ignoring the importance of archaeological heritage and its destruction by professionals themselves and state authorities. Quite a few archaeological sites have disappeared due to the lack of interest in enforcing legislation at all governance levels. This paper presents a few examples in Belgrade, which prove the existing problem as well as the problem of avoiding the possibility of preserving and presenting the findings in situ even after all the preventive archaeological examinations have been carried out.- Conscious announcements of the government concerning their inept handling of archaeological heritage and its destruction. More often than not inappropriate planning serves as an open announcement of the devastation of archaeological heritage (Students’ Square in Belgrade – the area of the Roman Singidunum; The Fortress in Smederevo – the medieval fortification, which is on the Tentative List for inscription in the WHL).- Е-75 and Е-80 motorway routes. The lack of will of those in power to make plans early on not only for protective archaeological examinations themselves (which have been done quite well), but for making decisions about what should be done with the exposed sites, has inevitably led to the situation that along the entire motorway route not one, of a few dozen examined archaeological sites, has been preserved for presentation purposes.The section entitled Who are the guardians of the archaeological heritage in Serbia?, points to the fact that few archaeologists employed at cultural heritage protection institutions can hardly provide answers to the challenges which they have been faced with.Devastation of archaeological sites has reached such a scale in Serbia that saying it has become a chronic problem would be a vast understatement. Serbia’s archaeological heritage has become so endangered that one is more inclined to think that there is a plan and a systemic approach in its destruction than there is any such plan aimed at its protection. A total lack of interest on the part of the State, accompanied by disappearing archaeological heritage, poses a question of whether such a situation is really coincidental.Looking at numerous problems one is faced with in an attempt to salvage Serbia’s archaeological heritage, it seems that the light at the end of the tunnel is hard to see. The only true way ahead would be possible if the majority of the representatives of our not so big profession truly came together and reached a consensus on what vision of archaeology we have at least for the foreseeable future. Neither of the groups of professionals within our institutions (researchers from institutes and faculties or employees in museums and institutes dealing with protection) covers all the areas in the field of archaeology. If we keep waiting for others to determine the development paths and guidelines for work, or if this is done by each group of professionals in institutions on their own, I am afraid we are going to stay trapped in the vicious circle we are currently in. We will carry on doing our best in our jobs, but the fact is that the core subject of our profession – archaeological heritage itself, which is not an inexhaustible resource – will also keep disappearing faster and more comprehensively than ever.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Named project is to take place over the course of 3 years with the end results being: revision of the state of previously known sites, systematic surveying and presentation of results achieved. As a result of the surveying, fifty one archaeological sites were precisely mapped and the degree of threat assessed. Out of these, 13 are multistrata (three with Neolithic, two with Bronze Age, two Hallstatt, nine La Tene, nine with Roman and threewith Medieval fi nds) sites. Neolithic fi nds were detected on seven sites (one belonging to Starčevo culture, two have both Starčevo and Vinča fi nds and four belong to Vinča culture), one site can be dated to Hallstatt period, five to La Tene, twenty one to Roman and one to Medieval period, with three sites being chronologically undetermined. Belgrade, SerbiaSave to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Instantaneously, certain sites on the left bank of the named river were also visited, withseveral new sites being registered. On the right bank of Kolubara River, in the municipality of Obrenovac, 30 archaeologicalsites were evidenced, with additional 9 found on the left bank (previously not discovered in the 2004 survey campaign, or no data were available about their location at the time) –sites 52-60. The second phase of the Archaeological sites in Obrenovac municipality project is also the final phase of this surveying, resulting in an estimation of the current state of preservation of known sites, their exact positions and the degree of endangerment and the discovery of several new, previously unknown sites. Looking back at the area around the right bank ofKolubara River we would like to point out to the site of Bačevica (num. 64 in this article). The dominant position of the site (Fig. 1), results of trench excavations and aerial photographs (Fig. 2) suggest that this site should be among the first candidates for systematic archaeological excavations, with geophysical measurements as a mandatory step.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Eleven archaeological trenches of various sizes, covering approximately 250 sq. meters were opened in the process. Material remains, dated to the XVIII-XIX century (present in all segments of the excavated area), Roman period (from the second half of the 1st to mid 4th century AD) and the Bronze Age were detected on site. Three burials with cremation dated between mid 1st and mid 2nd century AD and the discovery of a part of a late Bronze Age necropolis (necropolis with rows) with 8 urns containing remains of cremations and accompanying findsstand out. Urns were discovered on a relative depth varying from 80 cm to 1.4 meters, at the same level as the foundation levels of Roman walls, whilst one urn was cut in half by a sewage duct dated to the 4th century AD. Based on the results of earlier research, these excavations were expected to uncover the remains of the Southeast rampart of the Roman military camp in Singidunum, but no traces were found during the campaign. It is also worth noticing that aside two stone sewage ducts no other significant architectural remains were discovered. The discovery of a part of the Roman necropolis with cremation burials raises a question whether this area was even within the walls of the military camp between mid 1st and mid 2nd century AD? The remains of the late Bronze Age necropolis is as significant find as others, suggesting the existence of a settlement of the same period somewhere close by.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This research is planned to last three years and to include the following: a revision of the state of the sites registered so far, a systematic fi eld survey, and fi nally, the presentation of the results obtained. The main goal is toestablish the exact locations of the already registered archaeological sites, to record the extent to which they are currently endangered, and to register the potential new sites. The second goal of this phase of work was to gain insight into the characteristics of the terrain in order to plan more thoroughlythe systematic fi eld survey of the territory of Obrenovac municipality, which is to follow in the third year of the mentioned project. In order to establish precisely the exact locations of the archaeological sites, their coordinates and dimensions were determined by the GPS. This method provided lasting data on the positions of the sites, unlike the changeable categories that are predominantly used in our country (the name of the owner, the number in cadastral register, et cetera). On this occasionfi fty-one sites were visited and carefully mapped, thirteen of which are stratifi ed (three with Neolithic, two with Bronze Age, two with Hallstattian, nine with La Tène and three with Medieval fi nds).Seven sites are purely Neolithic (one Starčevo, two Starčevo-Vinča and four Vinča), one is Hallstattian, fi ve La Tène, twenty-one Roman and one Medieval, while three sites could not be chronologically defi ned. The maps included in this paper are at the scale of 1:50,000, and the numbers of the sites in them correspond to the numbers of sites in the text.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Pokrivanje širokog spektra tema i znanstvenih disciplina rezultiralo je radovima i raspravama koje promiču znanstvenu problematiku iz područja metodologije, dokumentiranja i interpretacije arheoloških podataka. Interdisciplinarni karakter skupa na jednom mjestu okuplja arheologe i istraživače ostalih znanstvenih disciplina s kojima arheolozi blisko surađuju, a koji svojim radom, projektima i idejama promiču nove spoznaje o interpretaciji ljudskog života u prošlosti.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

PS 62 A2 - Crnobrnja A. Novac carice Salonine i nauk fi lozofa Plotina / Coinage of Empress Salonine and The Philosophy of Plotinby Program arheologija Istraživačka stanica Petnica  * Department of archeology Petnica Science Center and Adam CrnobrnjaPetničke sveske 62: 22.Novac carice Salonine i nauk fi lozofa Plotina U ovome radu obraćena je posebna pažnja na najnovi... more Novac carice Salonine i nauk fi lozofa Plotina U ovome radu obraćena je posebna pažnja na najnovije podatke dobijene tumačenjem novca carice Salonine, posebno eksplicitne prestave krsta na jednom od njih, kao i značaja Plotinovog prisustva na carskom dvoru u pokušaju davanja odgovora, ne samo na pitanje Saloninine verske opredeljenosti, već, pre svega, na jedan novi aspekt tumačenja samog Plotinovog nauka. Kao smela pretpostavka, umesto zaključka, nametnulo se pitanje da li i samoga Plotina možemo posmatrati samo kao uzor kasnijim hrišćanskim ocima, ili ga možemo ceniti i kao istinitog ranohrišćanskog mislioca? Ključne reči: Salonina, Plotin, hrišćanstvo, krst, novac. Kao prvo priznavanje hrišćanstva za zvaničnu religiju najčešće se navodi Milanski edikt cara Konstantina, donet 313. godine. Postojanje još jednog, ranijeg edikta o verskoj toleranciji, koji je 261. godine doneo car Galijen, najčešće biva prenebregnut. Imajući u vidu i, u literaturi duže od stoleća prisutnu, dilemu o mogućnosti da je Galijenova supruga, carica Salonina, bila hrišćanka, cela stvar postaje još interesantnija. U ovome radu biće obraćena posebna pažnja na najnovije podatke dobijene tumačenjem novca carice Salonine, posebno eksplicitne prestave krsta na jednom od njih, kao i značaja Plotinovog prisustva na carskom dvoru u pokušaju davanja odgovora, ne samo na pitanje Saloninine verske opredeljenosti, već, pre svega, na jedan novi aspekt tumačenja samog Plotinovog nauka. Atmosferu na carskom dvoru prenosi nam pisac crkvene istorije Eusebije, koji ukazuje na predusretljivost i otvorenost carskog doma prema hrišćanima i zaključuje da to " bejaše Crkva božja " (Eusebius, Historia Ecclesiae, VII, 10, 3-4). 1 Taj podatak nam nedvosmisleno govori da je u visokim aristokratskim krugovima postojao i priličan broj pristalica hrišćanske vere. Godine 257 – 258, u vremenu teške političke i vojne krize, Valerijan donosi dva edikta protiv hrišćana. Nakon Valerijanove smrti 260. godine, njegov naslednik, i sada jedini car u Carstvu, Galijen, poništava očeve edikte i uspostavlja verski mir. Galijenov edikt iz 261. godine uvažava i priznaje hrišćansku crkvu (Sordi 1984: 119). Potez cara Galijena doprineo je stvaranju unutrašnjeg mira i reda. Ovaj edikt je pratila i naredba da se sva oteta imovina i groblja vrate crkvi, kao i njenim pristalicama koje su stradale u progonima. Kod Eusebija vidimo da je car Galijen slao episkopima kopije svojih odluka (edikta), koje su bile dodatna garancija u sprovođenju donetih mera (Eusebius, Hist. Eccl. VII, 13, 1). Aleksandrijski episkop Danilo u pismu upućenom Ermamonu, 262. g., ističe svoje oduševljenje verskim mirom koji je Galijen uspostavio (Eusebius, Hist. Eccl. VII, 23, 4).Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

A new review of the topography and typology of the Danubian Horsemen lead icons in the south-eastern part of Pannonia inferiorStarinarAlthough the artefacts belonging to the so-called Danubian Horsemen cult have been scientifically... more Although the artefacts belonging to the so-called Danubian Horsemen cult have been scientifically examined from various standpoints, the definitive answers to the question of their nature have not yet been reached. One of the key reasons that can be distinguished with regard to this is the lack of insight into the archaeological context since, in comparison to the total number of these artefacts, a small percentage of the samples have been found during archaeological excavations. As the more recent corpora of lead icons points to the conclusion that a significant number originates from the area of the province of Pannonia Inferior, especially its south-eastern part (today`s Srem, Macva and Posavina), in this paper we have tried to establish at least the widest context they belonged to. Thus, based on the place where they were found, and considering the basic features of the site where it was possible, we investigated whether they belonged to a settlement, necropolis or military sett...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Најобимнији део рада, детаљан каталог локалитета, њих укупно 605, дат је у поглављу Каталог римских локалитета у југоисточном делу Доње Паноније. То поглавље се физички налази на крају рада, а за сваки локалитет су дате детаљне информације: врста, положај, опис, датовање и литература. Сви локалитети су картирани и њихови редни бројеви одговарају бројевима на приложеним картама. Крајњи циљ рада је покушај сагледавања динамике запоседања простора у периоду римске доминације, његове намене као и међусобног односа насеља, фортификација и комуникација у простору и времену. У уводним разматрањима образложени су територијални и хронолошки оквири рада, који обухватају простор савремених области Срема, Мачве, Поцерине, Посавине и Семберије, у периоду од дол...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Extensive geophysical investigations were carried out during the 2010 campaign and, based on the results, we started investigations of the Late Vinca house 01/2010. The following comprehensive report details the method of construction and organisation of life in that house, which dates from the Vinca culture phase D. The house was very well preserved and we paid special attention to two large ovens inside the house as well as to some interesting portable finds (a clay table, a clay millstone structure and three large clay heads).Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The distinctiveness of this find is that it was discovered in it original context, where the figurines were used, and that the objects were found in their original arrangement. I also discuss to what extent it is possible, considering the figurines arrangement, to understand hints of social structure and organisation of communities in the final phase of Vinča culture.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

What was their purpose? Were they autonomous or part of some wider communities? How large was the territory within which people of that time defined themselves as ‘we’ and where did communities of ‘others’ begin? The objective of this work is to indicate the possibilities for studying the complexity of group identities in the Late Vinča societies. We take as a starting point the micro-region of Drenski Vis in north-western Serbia, where five Late Vinča settlements have been discovered.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

На организацију и реализацију овогодишње скупштине и скупа Друштва свакако је утицала епидемиолошка ситуација изазвана вирусом ковид-19. Првобитно је био планиран за крај маја 2020. године, али је због епидемиолошке ситуације одложен, најпре за период 8–10. октобра, у нади да ће у том термину моћи да буде одржан. Међутим, због великог броја пријављених учесника из земље и иностранства, непредвидивих прилика услед пандемије али и лоших финансијских услова као последице пандемије, донета је одлука да Скуп буде одржан преко интернета (онлајн) у периоду 14–16. октобра 2020. године, у оквиру пет редовних секција и две тематске сесије.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
O problemu ''izvoza'' olovnih pločica kulta podunavskih konjanika/Illicit trafficking of the Danubian horsemen cult lead plaquesby Bojana Plemić and Adam CrnobrnjaGlasnik Srpskog arheološkog društva/Journal of the Serbian Archaeological Society 38,  2022The paper points out the problem of illicit trafficking of the Danubian

Thus, by reviewing three large synthetic corpora of these findings, as well as relevant data in recent literature, we came to an approximate number of 1300-1450 pieces belonging to private collections, whether published or not. Such a situation was caused, among other things, by decades of inaccuracy and lack of interest by competent authorities regarding the questionsof looting of archaeological heritage. Therefore, we should not be surprised that foreign analyses state that the search and trade of archaeological artefacts in Serbia have reached “industrial proportions”. One part of this “industry” resulted in the situation that approximately 85% of Danubian horsemen lead plaques are in private collections, and about 74% of them are abroad, while only around 100 of them are kept in Serbia’s museums.Accordingly, on this occasion, we drew attention to the ways of theirdistribution, and the likely existence of developing chains for such a trade, with a special reference to the growing role of the Internet and various types of online communication in these processes. Considering that the biggest consequence of illegal searchers’ activities is the devastation of archaeological sites, which causes the lack of valuable knowledge that an archaeological context itself can provide us in terms of this cult’s perceptions, we considered the extent to which this situation has contributed to the loss of scientific discourse. Since the numberof unpublished findings of lead icons from private collections is quite high, the question arises as to how realistic it is at the moment to talk about a final typology, iconographic variants or chronic lack of inscriptions which are the source of many doubts for researchers of this mysterious cult. With another reminder ofthe obligations of the authorities and heritage professionals, and the legal frameworkrelated to the issues presented here, we hope that this paper can be a kind of appeal about the need to stop the negative trends presented here in terms not only of the Danubian horsemen lead icons “export’, but also other archaeological findings from the territory of Serbia.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
