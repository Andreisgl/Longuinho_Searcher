My Commons contributions[edit]
I do my best to contribute various types of free images. I do image restorations and release them into the public domain (where possible), upload scans of public domain pictures obtained from various print sources, and upload images I take with my own camera when possible. I may also upload scans of free paintings, posters, or other artistic works. A list of my uploads can be seen here.
