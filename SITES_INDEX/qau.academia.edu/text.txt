In this myth Chubb is the prophet of a deity who looks like a young boy and loving boys has spiritual significance. Chubb's pre-modern perception of his sexual orientation helps us to understand the changing views of homosexuality. This study may help in understanding the relationship between sexual desire and the development of personal myths.Save to Libraryby Tariq Rahman•  12  Psychology, Creativity, Adolescent, EnglandThe Urdu —English Controversy in PakistanSave to LibraryDownloadby Tariq Rahman•MultidisciplinaryLinguistic Deviation as a Stylistic Device in Pakistani English FictionThe idea of literary language, especially poetic language, being somehow deviant from the language of discursive prose forms the basis of some recent contemporary stylistic theories.

As government and security were the major concerns of the colonial government they made the bureaucracy (ICS) and the military prestigious and efficient institutions while higher education remained subordinate, government-controlled and poor. Being unattractive, the universities could not attract the most competent students and remained medieval teaching institutions with almost no research. This continues in Pakistan because the ruling elites of Pakistan continue to govern the country in the colonial tradition of the past. In the last section certain changes are suggested to make the universities more academically competent.Save to LibraryDownloadby Tariq Rahman•  2  Pakistan, University, higher education, colonialism, British IndiaPakistan's policies and practices towards the religious minoritiesThe religious minorities of Pakistan suffer gross human rights abuses because the state has increasingly moved to the right in a bid to seek legitimacy and cohesiveness by using Islamic symbols and rhetoric in support of its rule.

Thus, there are laws which discriminate against non-Muslim citizens exposing them to legal prosecution and extrajudicial persecution by their fellow citizens. As radical Islamic groups gain strength in the country, the non-Muslims find the society getting increasingly intolerant.Save to LibraryDownloadby Tariq Rahman•  4  Human Rights, Islam, Human right, History and archaeologyEPHEBOPHILIA: THE CASE FOR THE USE OF A NEW WORD...
