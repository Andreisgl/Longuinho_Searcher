Access to electricity is considered an essential element in the sustainable development of rural areas and an enabler for countries to achieve their Millennium Development Goals. This paper contributes the first analytical study of the socio-economic factors which have a significant impact on rural electrification (RE) development in sub-Saharan Africa. The study employs cross-sectional data for 24 of the 47 countries in the sub-Saharan region and finds factors including the Human Development Index, wealth distribution, institutional development and urban population size of a country to have a significant impact on RE development.

The harmonization of basic intellectual property standards has operated to protect investment in innovation, limiting risks from unjustified ‘free riding’. Yet these same harmonized IP standards sharply curtailed the traditional capacity of suppliers of public goods, such as health care and nutrition, to address priority needs of less affluent members of society, particularly in (but not limited to) developing countries. In the Doha Declaration, the Waiver Decision of 30 August 2003 and the Article 31bis Protocol of Amendment, stakeholders concerned with re-opening policy space for the supply of newer pharmaceutical products pushed back against restrictive elements of the TRIPS Agreement.Governments around the world are in the process of deciding whether to ratify and accept the Article 31bis Amendment.

This result is unexpected given previous research which suggests that immigrants from countries with high levels of self-employment tend to be more involved in self-employment in the U.S. Developing countries on average have higher self-employment rates than do developed countries but our research shows that immigrants from developing countries have similar or lower self-employment probabilities relative to native born White Americans, whereas immigrant from developed countries have significantly higher self-employment probabilities relative to native born White Americans.

The part of the research project documented here was designed to examine the question: ‘Is the regulatory regime conducive to entrepreneurial action and market discovery’ with particular reference to the low-income schools in Hyderabad. This paper is narrowly focused, setting out the results of pattern matching empirical data with the Austrian economic concepts of entrepreneurship, rivalry, and market discovery. The research discovered that two regulatory regimes exist, one that is set out ‘on paper’ in the Education Acts and associated rules, and another that operates ‘in practice’. That is, there is a combination of regulations ‘on paper’ and regulations existing in an ‘extra-legal’ sector. Generally it was found that the regulations ‘in practice’ are consistent with market principles. Conversely the regulations set out ‘on paper’ are not conducive to entrepreneurial innovation and market discovery. Recommendations for potential policy initiatives include the possibility of legitimising the ‘extra-legal’ sector by introducing self-regulation possibly via self-evaluation systems for the private unaided schools.Save to LibraryDownloadby James Tooley•  9  Economics, Austrian Economics, Developing Country, Andhra PradeshThe World Technology FrontierSave to LibraryDownloadby Francesco Caselli•  3  Economics, Latin American Economic History, Developing CountryThink Globally Act Locally: The Case for SymphysiotomyWhen expatriate doctors from developed countries working in sub-Saharan Africa suggest to the local doctors and midwives that symphysiotomies should sometimes be done, they are silenced neither with quotations from the medical literature... moreWhen expatriate doctors from developed countries working in sub-Saharan Africa suggest to the local doctors and midwives that symphysiotomies should sometimes be done, they are silenced neither with quotations from the medical literature nor with tales of patients seen, but with: “If symphysiotomies are such good operations why don&#x27;t you perform them at home?” Here is why.Save to LibraryDownloadby Douwe Verkuyl•  14  Africa, Medicine, Maternal Mortality, PregnancyThe Privatisation in Developing Countries: Reflections on a PanaceaSave to LibraryDownloadby Olivier Bouin•  2  Business, Developing CountryExpert meeting on Child Growth and Micronutrient Deficiencies--New Initiatives for Developing Countries to Achieve Millennium Development Goals: executive summary reportUndernutrition in early childhood has long-term physical and intellectual consequences.

Improving child growth should start before the age of two years and be an integrated effort between all sectors, covering all aspects such as diet and nutrient intake, disease reduction, optimum child care, and improved environmental sanitation. To discuss these issues, the Indonesian Danone Institute Foundation organized an expert meeting on Child Growth and Micronutrient Deficiencies: New Initiatives for Developing Countries to Achieve Millennium Development Goals. The objective of the meeting was to have a retrospective view on child growth: lessons learned from programs to overcome under-nutrition in the developed countries and to relate the situation to the Indonesian context, as well as to discuss implications for future programs.

METHODS: A systematic meta-analysis of 57 studies measuring bacteria counts for source water and stored water in the home to assess how contamination varied between settings. RESULTS: The bacteriological quality of drinking water significantly declines after collection in many settings. The extent of contamination after water collection varies considerably between settings, but is proportionately greater where faecal and total coliform counts in source water are low. CONCLUSIONS: Policies that aim to improve water quality through source improvements may be compromised by post-collection contamination. Safer household water storage and treatment is recommended to prevent this, together with point-of-use water quality monitoring.Save to LibraryDownloadby James Wright•  20  Microbiology, Water quality, Water Purification, Tropical MedicineOral sensorimotor function for feeding in patients with tetanusSave to LibraryDownloadby Sigrid De Sousa dos Santos•  20  Evaluation, Biological Sciences, Factor analysis, HumansMechanization and technical interactions in multi-species Indian fisheries: implications for economic and biological sustainabilitySave to LibraryDownloadby Ramachandra Bhatta•  7  Law, Political Science, Developing Country, ProfitabilityActive labour market policies around the world - Coping with the consequences of globalizationSave to LibraryDownloadby Janine Leschke•  10  Technological change, Labour market policy, Developing Country, Job SearchThe Un System' S Forum for Nutrition Sub-Committee on NutritionSave to Libraryby Richard  Jolly and +1Sonya Rabeneck•  2  Developing Country, Coordination MechanismsInstitutional analysis and decentralization: Developing an analytical framework for effective third world administrative reformAs we enter the 1990s, scholars and practitioners of development administration in the Third World share a deep concern with its disappointing performance.

Looked to as the primary agent of modernization during the optimistic first days of independence, many now blame it for the development stagnation of much of the Third World over the past two decades. Reinforced by the events of 1989 in Eastern Europe, calls for privatization and radical cutbacks in the state are increasing. Indeed, while the causes of Third World development stagnation are undoubtedly multiple and diverse, it is difficult to refute the charge that the hierarchical, bureaucratic, centrally-led strategy has not achieved what was expected of it. The question which faces responsible and concerned scholars, practitioners and officials today, is what can and should be done about all this? This paper recommends avoiding grand and precipitous changes in organizational strategies: indiscriminate privatization and dismantling the state, it argues, would be just as much an error as the earlier whole-cloth commitment to centralist-bureaucratic organization. Instead it argues that theoretical and analytical tools effective in making more subtle and refined choices among institutional alternatives must be developed. It presents a preliminary analysis of one strategy which might offer this, and illustrates how it can be used to design organizations more likely successfully to deliver services and sustain investments in the Third World.Save to LibraryDownloadby syukriy abdullah•  7  Applied Economics, Decentralization, Developing Country, Business and ManagementManaging externally-assisted health projects for sustainability in developing countriesOne of the main problems related to donor-supported health projects in the developing world is their lack of sustainability once external assistance has ended.

Although ‘projectized development assistance’ is viewed by many as inappropriate to bring about development, projects are bound to remain for some time an important instrument of development assistance. Project managers, donor agencies and recipient countries need to be aware of the extent that their projects are likely to be sustained in the future and contribute to the viability of the whole health system. This article proposes a conceptual framework to monitor the performance of externally-assisted health projects in building their own sustainability. Possible criteria and indicators are discussed.Save to LibraryDownloadby Angelo Stefanini•  5  Project Management, Project evaluation, Developing Country, Public health systems and services researchUrgences transfusionnelles et infection VIH en milieu hospitalier tropicalSave to LibraryDownloadby I.

We observed 1,081 outpatient consultations with patients less than five years of age in Tanzania. In 554 patients with cough or difficulty breathing, the absolute percentages examined were 5% for respiratory rate counted, 14% chest exposed, and 25% stethoscope used. Decisions to conduct particular examinations did appear to follow clinical logic, with odds ratios of 4.28 for counting respiratory rate (95% confidence interval [CI]=1.75-10.47), 2.57 for exposing the chest (95% CI=1.67-3.95), and 18.91 for using a stethoscope (95% CI=9.52-37.57) in patients with cough or difficulty breathing. Non-clinical variables, including salary level, were also associated with examinations, and history taking was more common among clinicians originating outside the hospital area.

While the use of these front line workers has the potential to positively influence health behavior and health status in rural communities, there continues to be challenges to effective implementation of CHW programs. Reports of high turnover rates, absenteeism, poor quality of work, and low morale among CHWs have often been associated with weak organizational and managerial capacity of government health systems. However, no systematic research has examined the contribution of work-related factors to CHW job performance. The research reported in this paper examines the relative influence of reward and feedback factors associated with the community compared to those associated with the health system on the performance of CHWs.

In this paper, the distribution of aetiologic agents, clinical presentation, and evolution of pneumonia cases are described, and the factors associated with duration of pneumonia episode and of hospital admission examined. During June 1994-June 1995, 472 children, aged 6-59 months, with clinical diagnosis of pneumonia, who were admitted to hospital or treated as outpatients, were investigated in Recife, Northeast Brazil. Pneumonia, in most cases, was confirmed by radiology. A combination of methods was used for investigating the aetiology of pneumonia. Data obtained on a large number of clinical, socioeconomic and biological variables were analyzed to determine the prognostic factors for the severity and outcome of pneumonia.

The study sought to find out to what level the forensic auditors are able to fulfill this mandate and investigate problems that hinder forensic auditors to make progress in their operations in developing countries. It also established the role of forensic auditing in banking operations. Questionnaires, personal interviews, and document review are the methods that were used to obtain data for this study. A sample of thirty forensic auditors was used from thirteen commercial banks, four building societies, and four audit firms in Zimbabwe. It was found that the forensic auditing departments suffer from multiple challenges, amongst them being the lack of material resources, technical know how, interference from management, and unclear recognition of the profession.

A large body of literature has already underlined the occurrence of widening wage and employment differentials between skilled and unskilled workers in high-income countries (HICs) (Katz and Autor, 1999). Such empirical evidence is consistent with both trade- and technology-based explanations while these competing theoretical frameworks predict opposite effects on within- country inequality in LMICs. Recent analytical advancements have found convergent elements between these two lines of research, especially in the prediction of the employment impact of technology transfer. However, a systematic lack of data in LMICs still hampers empirical research on the determinants of the witnessed increase in inequality in these economies. This paper provides a direct measure of technology transfer from HICs,...Save to LibraryDownloadby marco vivarelli•  5  Technology transfer, Developing Country, Manufacturing Sector, Capital-skill complementarityNextLast »Related TopicsCultural FrameworksFollowFollowingEconomic ImpactFollowFollowingInternational business cultureFollowFollowingWorldFollowFollowingElectrical energyFollowFollowingEnergy CrisisFollowFollowingKongre TurizmiFollowFollowingPoverty ReductionFollowFollowingAlternative TourismFollowFollowingApplied EconomicsFollowFollowing 71.6 million researchers use this site every month.
