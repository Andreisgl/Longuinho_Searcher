About us
What we do
Northern Ireland Water is a Government Owned Company (GoCo), set up in April 2007 to provide the water and sewerage services in Northern Ireland.
We deliver clean, safe drinking water to approximately 840,000 households and businesses. We supply customers with approximately 560 million litres of good quality drinking water every day. We collect approximately 330 million litres of wastewater per day from around 669,000 households and organisations connected to the sewerage system and transfer it to a works where it is treated and disposed of safely.
In order to deliver this service we require a huge system of pipes, pumping stations, water and wastewater treatment works and reservoirs. There are 26,700 kilometres of watermains and 15,600 kilometres of sewers in Northern Ireland. Though most of the time this system works well, we are planning a lot of investment over the next few years to ensure that we protect public health and the environment for generations to come. In fact, by 2020 we are planning to invest £3 billion that will reduce leakage levels, lower the threats of flooding and improve water and wastewater quality.
We believe in the years to come we can deliver much more than just water and sewerage services. We own one of the most visited tourist sites in Northern Ireland, Silent Valley , situated in an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and with a fantastic new Visitor Centre. We also hope to open many more of our sites to visits from the public.
We work with an array of organisations and agencies in projects to improve the quality of life for others. These range from the University of Ulster in the Step Up Programme to our nominated charity WaterAid, which saves the lives of thousands of people in Africa and Asia. So the 1300 people who work for Northern Ireland Water are working hard not just to provide world class water and sewerage services for their customers, but to put something back into their community and into communities world-wide which do not have clean water and basic sanitation.
