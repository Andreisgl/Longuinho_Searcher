My hat’s off to her.” — C. J. Box, #1 New York Times bestselling author of Long Range"My favorite Chevy Stevens book since Still Missing...The suspense builds with every page, and the ending is a complete shocker."—Sarah Pekkanen, #1 New York Times Bestselling Author of The Wife Between Us"Aptly named, Dark Roads is deep, dark, and unsettling. From the opening page, it’s clear you’re in the hands of a master storyteller...With brilliant characterizations, tight plotting, and a setting bound to give you chills, this is Stevens's finest book to date. A tour de force mystery you do not want to miss."—J.T. Ellison, New York Times bestselling author of Her Dark Lies"Chevy Stevens is back and better than ever...Dark Roads is a chilling, pulse-pounding thriller that also tugs at the heartstrings. It's everything you've come to love from a master of the psych thriller genre!"— Mary Kubica, New York Times bestselling author of The Other Mrs.The Cold Creek Highway stretches close to five hundred miles through British Columbia’s rugged wilderness to the west coast. Isolated and vast, it has become a prime hunting ground for predators. For decades, young women traveling the road have gone missing. Motorists and hitchhikers, those passing through or living in one of the small towns scattered along the region, have fallen prey time and again. And no killer or abductor who has stalked the highway has ever been brought to justice.Hailey McBride calls Cold Creek home. Her father taught her to respect nature, how to live and survive off the land, and to never travel the highway alone. Now he’s gone, leaving her a teenage orphan in the care of her aunt whose police officer husband uses his badge as a means to bully and control Hailey. Overwhelmed by grief and forbidden to work, socialize, or date, Hailey vanishes into the mountainous terrain, hoping everyone will believe she’s left town. Rumors spread that she was taken by the highway killer—who’s claimed another victim over the summer.One year later, Beth Chevalier arrives in Cold Creek, where her sister Amber lived—and where she was murdered. Estranged from her parents and seeking closure, Beth takes a waitressing job at the local diner, just as Amber did, desperate to understand what happened to her and why. But Beth’s search for answers puts a target on her back—and threatens to reveal the truth behind Hailey’s disappearance…Read moreSkip carouselCarousel PreviousCarousel NextContemporary Women'sThrillersLanguageEnglishPublisherMacmillan PublishersRelease dateAug 3, 2021ISBN9781250133588Switch to audiobookStart your free  daysRead previewSave for laterDownload to appShareShare titleCSAuthorChevy StevensCHEVY STEVENS lives on Vancouver Island with her husband and daughter. When she isn’t working on her next book, she’s hiking with her two dogs on her favorite mountain trails and spending time with her family. Chevy's current obsessions are vintage Airstreams, Hollywood memoirs, all things mid-century modern, and stand-up comedians--not necessarily in that order. Her books, including Still Missing, a New York Times bestseller and winner of the International Thriller Writers Award for Best First Novel, have been published in more than thirty countries.Read moreRead more from Chevy StevensSkip carouselCarousel PreviousCarousel NextNever Knowing: A NovelEbookNever Knowing: A NovelbyChevy StevensRating: 3 out of 5 stars3/5Save Never Knowing: A Novel for laterStill Missing: A NovelEbookStill Missing: A NovelbyChevy StevensRating: 3 out of 5 stars3/5Save Still Missing: A Novel for laterAlways Watching: A NovelEbookAlways Watching: A NovelbyChevy StevensRating: 3 out of 5 stars3/5Save Always Watching: A Novel for laterRelated to Dark RoadsRelated ebooksSkip carouselCarousel PreviousCarousel NextMore Than You'll Ever Know: A Good Morning America Book Club PickEbookMore Than You'll Ever Know: A Good Morning America Book Club PickbyKatie GutierrezRating: 3 out of 5 stars3/5Save More Than You'll Ever Know: A Good Morning America Book Club Pick for laterThe Therapist: A NovelEbookThe Therapist: A NovelbyB A ParisRating: 3 out of 5 stars3/5Save The Therapist: A Novel for laterThe Collective: A NovelEbookThe Collective: A NovelbyAlison GaylinRating: 3 out of 5 stars3/5Save The Collective: A Novel for laterHis & Hers: A NovelEbookHis & Hers: A NovelbyAlice FeeneyRating: 4 out of 5 stars4/5Save His & Hers: A Novel for laterInsomnia: A NovelEbookInsomnia: A NovelbySarah PinboroughRating: 0 out of 5 stars0 ratingsSave Insomnia: A Novel for laterFirst Born: A NovelEbookFirst Born: A NovelbyWill DeanRating: 4 out of 5 stars4/5Save First Born: A Novel for laterDon't Look for Me: A NovelEbookDon't Look for Me: A NovelbyWendy WalkerRating: 3 out of 5 stars3/5Save Don't Look for Me: A Novel for laterThose Empty Eyes: A Chilling Novel of Suspense with a Shocking TwistEbookThose Empty Eyes: A Chilling Novel of Suspense with a Shocking TwistbyCharlie DonleaRating: 4 out of 5 stars4/5Save Those Empty Eyes: A Chilling Novel of Suspense with a Shocking Twist for laterFriends Like These: A NovelEbookFriends Like These: A NovelbyKimberly McCreightRating: 3 out of 5 stars3/5Save Friends Like These: A Novel for laterDear Child: A NovelEbookDear Child: A NovelbyRomy HausmannRating: 3 out of 5 stars3/5Save Dear Child: A Novel for laterEvery Last Fear: A NovelEbookEvery Last Fear: A NovelbyAlex FinlayRating: 3 out of 5 stars3/5Save Every Last Fear: A Novel for laterThe Guilt Trip: A NovelEbookThe Guilt Trip: A NovelbySandie JonesRating: 3 out of 5 stars3/5Save The Guilt Trip: A Novel for laterWoman of the Year: A NovelEbookWoman of the Year: A NovelbyDarcey BellRating: 0 out of 5 stars0 ratingsSave Woman of the Year: A Novel for laterWatch Out for Her: A NovelEbookWatch Out for Her: A NovelbySamantha M.

Tap to rateWrite a reviewReview must be at least 10 wordsmarquis784-1Rating: 4 out of 5 stars4/5I received a complimentary digital copy of this book from the publisher and NetGalley. This review is my voluntary and unbiased opinion. This eerie story tells the sad story of how you never can tell who to trust. You take chances, trust people and possibly make a bad decision. Unfortunately, for some people this could be deadly. How well do we really know our neighbors and friends? It’s a scary thought to be in a position where you don’t feel like you can trust anyone. Hailey McBride finds herself in such a desperate situation after her father dies. Her mother had died of cancer when she was 5 years old so she learned all her life lessons from her father. Little did she know that those lessons about survival would save her life. Hailey is left in the care of her Aunt Lana, her second husband Eric Vaughn, and her young cousin Cash. Vaughn is the police chief with an icy, mean reputation. All Hailey wants is to grieve and live her life like a regular teen. Vaughn is overbearing and borderline abusive with his intimidating stalking. Hailey becomes freaked out when she discovers some shocking information which confirmed her fears about Vaughn. She sets out to find proof of his activities but ends up finding more trouble for herself. Her only friend Jonny Miller helps her as she plans to leave town to escape Vaughn’s control. She leaves behind Amber Chavelier, her new love interest, to protect her from Vaughn who will do anything to control Hailey. Her worst fears come true when she encounters the remains of a dead body off the side of the road and discovers it’s Amber. Hailey is devastated but watches as  Vaughn is first to arrive at the scene and take pictures. Later, Beth Chavelier moves to Cold Creek to understand what happened to her sister Amber. She ends up getting a job at the same diner where Amber had worked. Despite the warnings to be careful, Beth is careless and drinks and takes pills to cope with the pain. She doesn’t realize that being under the influence puts her in dangerous situations that end up being deadly. This is a twisted convoluted story of how easy it can be to get wrapped up in a web you can’t get out of until it’s too late. Read moreroncrouch-445920Rating: 4 out of 5 stars4/5Thoroughly enjoyed this book.Read morejhscolloquiumRating: 4 out of 5 stars4/5Author Chevy Stevens says that as a general rule, she tries not to be influenced by actual events, preferring to craft stories from her own imagination. But Dark Roads is an exception and proved to be the most difficult book for her to write thus far. The story was inspired by a series of crimes Stevens found so "disturbing" that the events lingered in her mind for years. Situated in Northern British Columbia, the Highway of Tears is where "women have been murdered or gone missing since the 1970s." While growing up in the area, the road served as a reminder to Stevens of the danger inherent in traveling alone in a remote location and a deterrent to hitchhiking. Most of the crimes remain unsolved. For Stevens, "the image of a desolate road haunted by the lost souls of women, searching for answers to their deaths, stuck with me."As a show of respect to the victims, their families, and the law enforcement personnel still working to bring their kidnappers and murderers to justice, Stevens concocted the fictional town of Cold Creek. Near the Cold Creek Highway is a campground adjacent to a lake, surrounded by a dense and mountainous forest. Her characters and the events depicted in Dark Roads are all products of her imagination, as well. However, as with the Highway of Tears, Stevens made more than half of the young women who have disappeared along the five-hundred-mile, expansive Cold Creek Highway First Nations women in recognition of the fact that "Indigenous women experience a disproportionately higher rate of violence and homicide than the average woman in Canada." Along the highway outside the small town of Cold Creek a billboard displays the names and photos of the victims, as well as a stern warning to women not to hitchhike. Some people think Cold Creek is haunted. It is undeniably "the last real stop for gas and provisions before taking your chances on the dark road ahead. It is also the last place several women had been seen."The story opens in June 2018 with Hailey McBride mourning her beloved father who was killed in a single vehicle crash. She now must live with her aunt Lana, her cousin, six-year-old Cash, and Lana's boorish husband, Erick Vaughn, a local police sergeant. Hailey's father taught her all about nature: hunting, fishing, food preparation, and survival in keeping with First Nations ways. He served as a wilderness guide for many years, and was well-known and respected in the community. In a compelling first-person narrative, Hailey laments, "He'd outsmarted cougars, bull moose, and grizzlies, and once nearly froze to death in a snowstorm, but survived it all, only to die on a hairpin curve." Vaughn watches Hailey's every move and insists that she must spend the summer babysitting Cash when what she really wants to do is get a part-time job working at the local diner. He warns her that she cannot participate in any parties or make any trips to the lake unless she is accompanied by Lana or Vaughn, and if she disobeys him, he will confiscate her mountain bike which is her only means of transportation. Vaughn is convinced that Hailey's best friend, Jonny, is responsible for a string of recent thefts of dirt bike parts. Jonny is a talented biker who performs repairs and has the chance to compete professionally.Hailey quickly realizes that Vaughn is a man with dark secrets, engaged in activities that he would not want Lana or anyone to know about. But when she investigates and discovers what he has been doing -- without her knowledge or consent -- she is revolted, outraged, and frightened because Vaughn wields power in Cold Creek. Worse, he skillfully thwarts her efforts to bring his conduct to light. Despondent, she cannot bring herself to continue living in the same house with him, especially after he sullies the "best thing in my life, the truest thing" and threatens Jonny's future. She convinces Jonny to help her hide deep in the forest. "I had to stay off the grid. Where no one would ever find me. I would live in the woods until I was of age. . . . The mountain would protect me. Dad had been preparing me since I was little."And, in fact, Hailey feels the darkness that has shrouded her begin to lift as she makes a home for herself in the forest. A stray dog she names Wolf becomes her companion, and she secretly communicates with Jonny. "I hadn't realized how trapped I'd felt in town, the noises, the people, everyone's obsession with social media." Alone in the woods, Hailey develops a sense of belonging, although she misses Jonny and Amber, the alluring waitress at the diner she was just getting to know when she found it necessary to leave. Stevens credibly portrays the means Hailey employs to survive and how she escapes danger more than once.But tragedy strikes and Hailey again sustains an unimaginable loss. She is convinced that Vaughn abducted and murdered at least one prior Cold Creek Highway victim, and when Amber becomes the latest young woman to lose her life, Hailey is devastated and determined to see that Vaughn is punished for his crimes. But how, given that Hailey herself is believed to be one of the victims?Amber was on her way to a music festival in the Yukon when she stopped for gas in Cold Creek and ended up staying. She spoke of Hailey to her sister, Beth, asking for prayers that Hailey is found safe. She tells Beth that she hates it in Cold Creek and might move on during their last conversation. Amber had no interest in returning to the family home where the girls' parents insisted that they attend church and refused to accept Amber's life choices. Beth has just begun an internship with a law firm and is planning to start law school in the fall when Amber's murder completely derails her life plan. She loses her job and her apartment, and makes her way to Cold Creek in search of answers. She winds up working as a waitress at the same diner where Amber was employed by the owner, Mason. She is taking pills and drinking too much, and has not told her parents the truth about her circumstances. Employing a third-person narrative, Stevens compassionately conveys Beth's struggle to find answers about what really happened to the sister who "had been her voice. Maybe that was why she had felt so weightless since she'd died. Unanchored. Lost." She ends up sleeping in her car at the campground by the lake and getting involved with Jonny, but she isn't prepared for what she eventually experiences in Cold Creek.Dark Roads is full of surprising plot twists and revelations. The fast-paced story is engrossing and Stevens has crafted sympathetic characters, especially Beth who, unlike Hailey, is not equipped to function in the forest. Despite her previous career ambitions, she is not particularly adept at investigating Amber's death, either. She finds herself in extreme danger once Stevens reveals the identity of Amber's killer.As the story screeches toward the revelation of the truth, Stevens accelerates its pace. She injects pulse-pounding confrontations and shocking developments as Hailey and Beth realize that they must work together in order to stay alive. Stevens' writing is lush and atmospheric, with the dark, dank forest serving as an inanimate but critical character in the story. Each of her characters is fully imagined and she eloquently illustrates the ways in which their relationships have caused them pain and loss leading to their present predicaments. Equally engaging is their journey to discovering their own resilience and determination, refusing to surrender to the impact their sorrowful experiences have had upon them. Both Hailey and Beth must face their feelings in order to move forward with their lives. Hailey prefers to evade her emotions, attempting to avoid detailing everything that she has endured in order to see justice served, observing that "talking meant feelings." She would rather simply move on. Beth recognizes that she must tell the full truth in order to find peace and create a meaningful life for herself. Dark Roads is a tautly constructed, believable, and cleverly named tale. Both Hailey and Beth travel very dark roads -- literally in and around the little town of Cold Creek, as well as figuratively as they navigate the emotional toll of their respective experiences. Stevens supplies a satisfying conclusion to her hauntingly entertaining thriller.Thanks to NetGalley for an Advance Reader's Copy of the book.Read morecarole888fortRating: 4 out of 5 stars4/5When it comes to instilling dread in her readers, Chevy Stevens is the queen of tension. Every word in Dark Roads comes with a fear factor, taking the reader along for a story that won’t soon be forgotten. The novel is based on the Highway of Tears in British Columbia, where more than eighty women and girls have disappeared, never to be found. In the book, it is called Cold Creek Highway. The story is narrated by Hailey, a seventeen-year-old whose parents are deceased, who has been taken in by the local cop and his wife and Beth, who moves to Cold Creek to search for her sister’s killer. The highway and the lives alongside it are the main subjects here. The characters, good ones and bad ones, are fascinating and multi-faceted. Not much else can be revealed and I highly recommend you read Dark Roads for yourself. A thriller written by Chevy Stevens is time well-spent. Thank you to St. Martin’s Press, NetGalley and the author for an e-ARC in exchange for an honest review.Read morekazevedo_53Rating: 3 out of 5 stars3/5When supposedly smart women do stupid things, it really ruins a book for me.Read morejmchshannonRating: 4 out of 5 stars4/5As a huge Chevy Stevens fan, I can safely say that Dark Roads is one of her best novels to date. Its basis in the real-life murder mysteries within a section of highway in British Columbia gives the story an added layer of legitimacy. Dark, disturbing, and more visceral than her previous novels, Ms. Stevens keeps you guessing until the very end. The characters’ pain is all too real, as is their frustration regarding those who are abusing their power. In part an ode to those who lost their lives on that deadly highway and in part a timely #metoo story, I believe Dark Roads solidifies Ms. Stevens’ ability to write stellar thrillers.Read moreedgoldbergRating: 3 out of 5 stars3/5OK, I liked the writing but I didn't like the subject matter of the first victim.

I always enjoy Chevy Stevens' work!Read morekimkimkim-7Rating: 4 out of 5 stars4/5The story starts out with death talking  - beautiful young girls taking chances - dying on dark roads - a five hundred mile highway - littered with death. A story conceived in truth that is uglier than any lie. Beautiful young girls that everyone should have cared about but few did.If you accept the premise that Hailey, the central character, is an extraordinary teenager you should have no trouble believing her story. If you tend to be a bit of a skeptic, you might question her super abilities thinking Ms. Stevens has put an awful lot on this character’s shoulders. Believing her “future was a long bridge hanging over a dark hole” Hailey is willing to take extreme chances to even the odds hoping to survive. Weaving the story with dark, evil, and abusive antagonists it is difficult to separate the overpowering sense of loss and helplessness front the psychological terror. It is almost impossible to find a way out of the darkness and rip through the web of threats, lies and deceit. The protectors are equally fierce and you realize there is going to be an horrific showdown. The story embraces love and caring relationships most of which fail far short of fruition. The loss of a partner, father, lover, child, friend is front and center though out the story. The choices and reasons which turn a person to or from good or evil were not always easy to discern. Clues were hard to come by and long in coming. The author is a master of distraction showing only flashes of what is to come. Shorter and less would have been more. Thank you NetGalley and St. Martin’s Press for a copy.Read moretwink_2Rating: 4 out of 5 stars4/5Canadian author Chevy Stevens takes inspiration from reality in her latest novel, Dark Roads.An estimated forty women have been killed or gone missing on the The Highway of Tears in British Columbia, Canada. Stevens' book takes place in a fictionalized town and on a fictionalized highway. Hailey is a young woman in Cold Creek. Her father has died and she now lives with her aunt, whose new husband is a cop in town. If you want frightening and downright evil look no further than Sergeant Vaughan. Stevens has created such a creepy character in him. My skin crawled as I read his scenes.I liked Hailey right away, her love of nature, her friend Jonny and her feisty nature. But why oh why, did she not tell her aunt, the RCMP or someone about Vaughan! So, yeah you guessed it - something bad happens - and she goes on the run. (Gentle readers, this is a good time to mention that there are numerous trigger situations in this book.)The second half of the book is recounted in Beth's voice. She's the sister of another young woman that went missing. I didn't like her as much as Hailey, who is younger, but more mature. It was while reading Beth's pov that I wondered if Dark Roads had been written as a YA novel. I found Beth's actions, reactions and emotions to be quite juvenile. And the rapidity of her relationship with Hailey's best friend Jonny seemed a bit unbelievable to me. There is a fourth character that I adored - Wolf the dog. Loved him and his huffing.The third half of the book alternates between Hailey and Beth as the tension and the danger ramps up. The pragmatic reader in me questioned some of Vaughan's actions and the fact that he keeps getting away with stuff. But it most certainly adds to the suspense. Stevens throws in a nice twist at the end alongside some truly nail biting scenes. The prologue and epilogue were thoughtful and respectful to those who have gone missing and/or been found. Dark Roads did keep turning pages, eager to see what would happen next. And just hoping that justice prevails in the end.Read morelorikboydRating: 4 out of 5 stars4/5This book is exactly what you expect from Chevy Stevens.  Dark, twisty, well researched.  The beginning, Hailey’s story, was a little slow moving for me, but, by the time I got to Beth’s part it had picked up and all came together nicely.  I do find that with Ms. Stevens books, they are extremely intense and can make the reader uncomfortable at the beginning.  I need to take more breaks, but as the story unfolds and the drama comes together I get into a nice rhythm.  Well researched, I felt the beauty, solitude and scariness of the woods.  Characters were real; flawed, everyday hardworking, trying to get by people.  Evil lurks in those we fear and those we trust.  Set in British Columbia but based loosely on Canada’s Highway of Tears where many young women, mostly indigenous, have disappeared.  Such a sad story, and I applaud Ms. Stevens for telling this story but in the same time respecting the families of these poor girls.  Hannah is grieving the sudden death of her Dad.  She is living with her Aunt and her Officer husband Vaughn.  Vaughn is creepy to the highest degree, which sets up the rest of the story nicely.  Hannah meets a drifter, Amber, and a special friendship develops until…..  Enter Beth, Amber’s sister and the rest of the story is like the river….going faster and faster until it comes to its final resting place!  Thanks to Ms. Stevens, St. Martin’s Press and NetGalley for this ARC. Opinion is mine alone!Read morepenny_l-1Rating: 5 out of 5 stars5/5Wow! This thriller is so fast paced and suspenseful, I had to remind myself to breathe! The story, so masterfully written and twisted, had me reading non-stop into the wee hours of the night.The well thought out plot veins in many directions - the history of the town, the missing girls, the town residents, corruption - then comes back around for a stunning reveal! When I reached the end the end of the book, it took several minutes for me to process what I had read. I don't want to spoil the story with a book summary review. But I will say there are parts so horrifying that the author noted "story may trigger disturbing memories in victims of crime" and provided a counseling referral.This heart pounding, adrenaline inducing dark thriller is the perfect read for psychological crime fans.*Thank you St. Martin's Press, NetGalley, and Chevy Stevens for the opportunity to read this ARC in exchange for my honest review.Read morealekee_1Rating: 4 out of 5 stars4/5The book, will keep you on the edge of your seat, and just when you think you have all the answers, guess again, or maybe you are right?Young woman missing, murdered, brutalized, what is going on?We meet some of those who become the victims, and this is a vey dark road we are traveling.With the author’s notes we learn that this story is based on an actual serial killer, killing up to twenty woman on the “Highway of Tears.” The location and names were change in this read, but the roots are in truth.Be careful you will soon be holding your breath!Mine was an audio book and the narrators are awesome!I received this book through Net Galley and the Macmillian Audio, and was not required to give a positive review.Read moreshe_climberRating: 4 out of 5 stars4/5Creepy!!! Teenage Hailey lives with her aunt and uncle after the sudden death of her father. Her uncle Vaughn is the local Sheriff, nicknamed "The Iceman" due to the hardline he takes with everyone in their small town. His niece gets much of his unwanted attention. Not wanting her to ride her bike to the lake down the Cold Creek Highway which is notorious for the disappearance of young women. Nor is she to see her best friend, Johnny, who Vaughn believes to be a common thief and all around bad influence. Before he even really gets a chance to pass judgement on Hailey's new girlfriend, she disappears. Hailey starts taking a closer look at Vaughn and doesn't like what she's finding. In response she runs away to live in the mountains like her father had taught her to do.And from here it gets really hard not give away too much. But I will say Beth appears in town to try and find closure after the death of her murdered sister. In doing so she attracts unwanted attention.The characters in this book are authentic, the setting tangible, the writing is spot on, the pacing is quick, the ending explosive, and there's an awesome dog, Wolf, who plays a significant role as well: what's not to love!Many thanks to #NetGalley and St Martin’s Press for providing me with an advanced reader copy in exchange for an honest review.Read morejfe16Rating: 5 out of 5 stars5/5Review of Uncorrected Digital GalleyFor decades, the authorities have warned women about hitchhiking along the Cold Creek Highway. Hitchhikers vanish, drivers whose cars break down disappear. Hailey McBride comes to live with her aunt after her father dies in an accident. But it’s unbearable for her and she runs away, thinking that she will disappear into the wilderness, leaving people to believe she became the victim of the killer who stalked women along the highway. A year later, Beth Chevalier arrives in Cold Creek to attend a memorial for the victims of the highway killer. Her sister, Amber, is counted among the victims of the highway killer and Beth struggles with the aftermath of losing her sister. She’s been unable to return to college, has lost both her job and her apartment, and is lying to her parents about her situation. She decides to stay in Cold Creek and finds a job at the local diner where her sister once worked. But there are secrets in Cold Creek . . . and those secrets may cost Beth her life.There a strong sense of place in this disturbing narrative that carries an undertone of desperation throughout the telling of the tale. The story is dark and apprehensive, filling readers with dread. Well-defined characters populate the narrative, but readers may cringe at some of the choices Hilary makes as the story unfolds. Surprises take the story in unexpected directions and there’s a revelation near the end of the story that readers simply won’t see coming. But there’s much to appreciate in this unnerving tale of life and death and justice. Although the story is based on true events, it’s in the telling of the tale that readers come to appreciate the tenacity, the friendship, and the young women’s refusal to become another statistic. This is a book that belongs on everyone’s must-read list.Highly recommended. I received a free copy of this eBook from St. Martin’s Press and NetGalley #DarkRoads #NetGalleyRead moreamcheri-1Rating: 4 out of 5 stars4/5This is my third book by Chevy Stevens and I'm definitely down for trying another. Even though I absolutely have some issues and was annoyed more than a few times... Oh, and I managed to get both the ebook and audiobook from NetGalley and used them both throughout. First, overall, I did enjoy the reading experience. The narrators were good and did a fine job of creating individual characters. The ebook was nice to switch to when I wanted to relax with the Kindle quietly. I would rate this one 3.5 but did round up. I might not have if it weren't for the epilogue. I'm going to bet that there will be plenty of readers who will find it cheesy or unnecessary but I liked it and it pulled me back to a more emotional space after feeling plenty of frustration over the way many of the crime solving and super-gross uncle bits were handled. Ultimately, though, if you've already read the author and enjoyed her work, you'll very likely be fine with this one. If it's your first, give it a shot but, if you're like me and can't just let the BS moments slide on by, be aware that they are there and you will be irritated at some point.Thanks to the publisher and NetGalley for hooking me up!Read morekathl33n-1Rating: 2 out of 5 stars2/5I have loved all of Chevy Stevens books but I just can't say that for this one. It started off great - the first couple of pages pulled me right in and then getting to know the characters went well and the ending took me by surprise and I loved the epilogue. But it's the whole middle that left me wandering around, literally with characters that just seemed to be wandering around and thinking. Honestly I was bored and began skimming most of the middle section. Plus, with the young characters and their relationships, it felt a bit YA to me. But, like all her books, this one also has great writing that you can just settle in and read effortlessly. Many thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for providing me with an advance copy.Read moreBook previewDark Roads - Chevy StevensPROLOGUE No one ever wakes up thinking, I’m going to die on a dark road tonight, but that’s the point, isn’t it? You’re young and free, with your entire life ahead of you. You’re busy falling in love, arguing over stupid things with your family, thinking of the perfect witty comment for Instagram. You take chances. You drive too fast and drink too much. Time unwinds in front of you like a luxurious, brightly colored ball of yarn. You think you have years to get it right. Then, all of a sudden, you meet the wrong person, and it’s over. Death didn’t come for me with a beautiful burst of light or angels singing, or anything, really. It was sharp, piercing pain, his eyes staring into mine as he choked me, and surprise. Even as my throat collapsed and blood vessels broke in my eyes, I thought someone was going to drive down the highway. Someone was going to see. There would be headlights and screaming. Well, there was screaming. Until, like I said, he choked it all out of me. I’m not the only one here. Many of us are still waiting, lingering in the air like whispers. We don’t talk about our deaths, or how we each made our fatal mistake, but I imagine we all knew about the Cold Creek Highway long before our bodies were dumped in a ditch or buried in the woods under a blanket of damp moss. You couldn’t grow up in the North without your parents warning you, or the clerk at the gas station telling you to watch out, or walking past posters of the victims with their sweet, hopeful smiles. All those grainy photos lined up in rows like they were in some sort of tragic yearbook. Graduating to nowhere. How many victims are there? The newspapers will tell you that twenty cases have been connected to the highway, more than half were First Nations, all of them young. Truth is no one knows for sure. Their bones are scattered, their names a brief note in a missing persons file. You’re wondering how someone could get away with all these killings unnoticed. It’s a fair question—if you’ve never driven the nearly five-hundred-mile highway that stretches west through the mountains to the coast in a long, undulating swath of gray. The towns and First Nations communities are small and far apart, with no buses or other sources of public transportation. The forest is a wall of thick impenetrable trees and dense underbrush that scratches at skin already welted from blackflies and mosquitoes. The mountains are sheer, the ravines deep and lined with jagged rocks or loose gravel that can slide a body all the way down and never return it. The rivers swell with rain and swallow anything in their path. Bears, cougars, and wolves carry off bones. Shrubs and ferns grow over the rest. The land is made for hiding. There are only a few police stations, some with a handful of officers. It wasn’t like it is now, with computers and databanks. There was no communication, no obvious pattern to the murders. Or maybe it was just blatant racism that had the police overlooking the problem. What was one more missing First Nations girl to them? Thousands were already missing or murdered across the country. White victims were given more attention, more press. By the time the RCMP realized that someone was hunting more than deer in the North and formed a task force, the cases went back decades. Witnesses forgot crucial details. Evidence was lost or destroyed. DNA had been recovered, but there were multiple samples that never matched to anyone. The original suspect was thought to be a trucker or a logger, someone transient. They speculated that he’d died and one, or more, had taken his place. The town erected a billboard warning women not to hitchhike. As if that would stop a girl hell-bent on running away or looking for a good time. The police promised to step up their patrols, while vigilantes with shotguns took nightly drives and swore that they’d put an end to it. But women still went missing. Sometimes from the highway, other times from nearby communities. They were seen at a party or walking home, then never again. Northerners said that there was something evil in those mountains. The highway was haunted, and so was the town of Cold Creek—the last real stop for gas and provisions before taking your chances on the dark road ahead. It was also the last place several women had been seen. Others said danger was just part of living in that rugged and remote terrain. Death of some type was always certain. Bored kids would get into trouble. Poverty led to violence. Tourists spoke about blinding headlights in their rearview mirrors that disappeared just as quickly. Teens told stories around fires and scared each other on shadowed trails, then giggled in relief when their friends leapt out. The highway was a favorite topic for sleepovers and Ouija boards. Every year someone dressed as a killer truck driver on Halloween. Maybe you’re thinking, Why would anyone ever visit such a terrible place, let alone live there? Well, the North taketh away, but the North also giveth. The valley between the mountains is rich with soil, and crops flourish. There is hunting, fishing, and cheap land, unencumbered by pesky neighbors and city rules. Most of the townspeople are third- or fourth-generation, but others come searching for work in logging and mining and never leave. I imagine it was easy for them to tell themselves that it was only unwary women and girls who fell victim to the highway. They had been too trusting. Too reckless. People were wiser now. And they were right, for a while. Several years passed without any girls having the bad luck to get murdered. The town relaxed, which was its first mistake. The heat rose that summer, broke records, and teenagers flooded out to the lake for the weekends. Girls walked to the bathrooms alone, skinny-dipped in the moonlight, and flashed truckers, until another body was found in the long, yellowed grass by the side of the road. An unfortunate motorist had stopped to pick wildflowers and got more than he bargained for. The dead woman was suspected to be a drug-addicted prostitute. There was a public vigil and there were community safety meetings, but in private most people thought that it was the woman’s lifestyle that led to her death. Who was to say it wasn’t her pimp or her drug dealer? But then, not two years later, a high school girl disappeared from a party in a cattle field bordering the highway. No evidence, no arrests. Days later, the farmer’s dog uncovered her decomposing body in a culvert. Her photo was added to the posters. Amateur sleuths hit the internet, opening Facebook groups and Reddit threads, tracing license plates and old prison records. Journalists wrote in-depth articles and scored book deals, hoping they’d succeed where the police had failed. But they haven’t. No one has. Our families and friends keep our roadside crosses painted and bring fresh flowers, teddy bears, and LED candles. The candles flicker for weeks until their batteries run out. People say silent prayers as they drive past. We hear them, and then we watch you leave us behind. You want to know which one I am, where I fit into the timeline of broken lives. Does it matter? We all share the same story, even if our killers are different, and we want to tell you our secrets. But that’s the thing with whispers. You have to listen closely to hear us. PART ONE CHAPTER 1 Hailey JUNE 2018 The door creaked open behind me. Footsteps shuffled across the floor to where I lay on my side, facing the wall and scrolling through photos on my phone, videos. He stopped inches from the bed. He thought he was being sneaky, but the mattress dipped as he leaned over, breathing across the back of my neck, stirring the hairs there. Little puffs of bubble-gum-toothpaste-scented air. Hailey? You awake? I rolled over, met my little cousin face-to-face. His brown eyes were delighted, his dark hair damp and spiking out in all different directions like he’d rubbed a towel over it. He climbed up beside me, sprawled on his back, his head on my other pillow, and kicked one of his legs in the air. He was wearing shorts and his knees were scratched. He smelled of suntan lotion. Are you still sad? I blinked hard. Yes. He flipped onto his side, squirmed closer, and ran his toy car up my shoulder to my neck with a vroom, vroom sound. Mommy said I’m not supposed to bother you. So why are you in here? I narrowed my eyes, but he just giggled and bumped his head under my chin, his fine hair tickling my nose. Can I come with you if you go to the doctor? What are you talking about? Vaughn said if you didn’t get better soon, they would take you to see the doctor. They have toys in the waiting room. He looked at me hopefully. I’m not sick. Lana’s voice called out from the kitchen. Cash? Where are you? His eyes widened. Here, you can sleep with Billy. He’s my favorite. He shoved a red truck into my hand and scurried out of the room, socks sliding as he rounded the corner. I put the truck on my night table. My water glass was empty, and I needed to go to the bathroom. I sat up and hung my head, tried to run my hands through my hair, but it was all in knots. My phone buzzed on the bed. I swiped my thumb across the screen. Jonny. Come to the lake tonight. I texted back. Not in the mood, loser-face. It might help, lame-ass. I pushed the truck back and forth with one finger, its wheels squeaking on the wood surface. The lake. I hadn’t been there for weeks. The water would be getting warmer. I listened to the noises out in the kitchen. Lana banging dishes, Cash pleading for more cookies. They smelled good. Maybe I’d feel like eating today. I took a shaky breath and messaged Jonny back. I’ll think about it. Text you later. The hallway was lined with photos of Cash as a baby, then as a toddler, the most recent one with his baseball bat over his shoulder. Photos of Vaughn and Lana on their wedding day. Cash standing between them, holding their hands and smiling proudly in his suit. A painting of an RCMP officer on the back of his horse, next to an official certificate. I peered closer. Erick Vaughn. I’d forgotten his first name was Erick. Even Lana didn’t call him that. I walked into their country-cute kitchen with the scrubbed-clean butcher-block counters, the cheerful yellow bowl of red apples. My aunt Lana was standing at the counter, blending something. The ice made loud crunching sounds as it broke up. She spotted me out of the corner of her eye and shut off the machine. Hailey! She gestured to the green slush. Want to share a smoothie? I could use some coffee. Sit, sit. I’ll get you a cup. Thanks. She set down the coffee, then flitted about the kitchen, cutting fruit and arranging pieces on a plate with cookies. She carried it over and placed it in front of me. She’d peeled an apple and orange, slicing them into careful sections as though I were six like Cash. She sat across from me. Her hair was as black as my mom’s had been, but Lana’s was cut in a sleek bob that skimmed her toned shoulders. She did yoga and Pilates, got up early and made Vaughn breakfast. Ironed his uniforms, always greeted him at the door. I wondered if it was hard being the sergeant’s wife. If she worried that he might not make it home one night. I used to worry about Dad when he drove up the mountain alone. Turned out I was right to be scared. Cash looked at me from where he was building something with Legos in front of the TV. I stuck my tongue out. He grinned, all gap-toothed, then he saw my cookies and frowned at his mom. No fair! When you clean your room, you can have more too. Cash groaned, and she turned back to me. Remember, before you shower, that you need to leave the window wide open. We haven’t gotten the fan fixed yet. If you need more shampoo and conditioner, soap, let me know. I can buy my personal stuff. I was hoping to get a job at the diner. Oh, if you want, but there will be a little money after the estate settles, and Vaughn was planning on investing some for your college fund. Maybe get you a car. There might not be much. She set down her fork. We should start sorting through your dad’s belongings. Can’t it wait? Well… She looked so uncomfortable that somehow it made it all seem worse. More final, if that was even possible. Vaughn thinks we should list the house soon, so it can sell this summer for a good price. He knows someone who wants to buy your dad’s tools and— No. When I saw her startled look, I added, They’re mine. What are you going to do with tools? Store them at Jonny’s. Lana wrinkled her forehead at the tone of my voice. I’m sure Vaughn wouldn’t mind if you wanted to put them in our garage. I don’t know… I mumbled. He keeps it so clean. She searched my face. He makes you nervous. He made everyone nervous. I shook my head, but I couldn’t meet her eyes, and she sighed. I know you kids call him the Iceman, but he’s not always like that. You see how he is with Cash. He’s only tough because he cares about this town. Yeah, Vaughn seemed okay with Cash, considering he wasn’t his father, and didn’t complain about the toys left lying everywhere or having to watch the same Disney movies on repeat, but when Vaughn was in uniform, he’d ticket someone for doing a few kilometers over the limit, then get them for having a burnt-out license plate light. He had tossed people in jail overnight just for arguing with him. I’d never met Lana’s first husband, some photographer in Seattle who left her broke. He didn’t visit Cash. When she moved back a couple of years ago, she met Vaughn at a memorial for the highway victims. Now she only had to work part-time at the florist’s, drove a shiny Acura with leather seats, and lived in a four-bedroom house. It was like there were two Vaughns. I didn’t want to be around either of them. Everything’s just so different. Lana reached over and held my hand. I know, give it some time. We don’t have to clear out the house right away. It’s so beautiful. It will sell fast. I shaped my lips into a polite smile. Thanks. I pulled my hand away slowly, hoping she wouldn’t notice anything was wrong, but she was still giving me that concerned look. Vaughn has a Moose Lodge meeting tonight. How about we make popcorn and watch a movie? Or we could just talk? "Some of my friends are going to see the new Avengers at the theater and I thought I might meet up with them. I’ll take my bike, so you don’t have to drive me." I didn’t want to lie, but I had to get out of here for a few hours. Jonny was right. I needed the lake. The woods. Okay. Well, don’t stay out too late. She searched her mind like she was trying to think of an appropriate curfew for a seventeen-year-old. Maybe eleven? It’s a long movie and we might get some food after. She looked at me, hesitating, and I realized she wasn’t sure if she should be firmer. It was just as weird for her as it was for me. This new relationship. I’ll text you. That would be great. Her face relaxed. I got up and took my dishes to the sink, put them away, and slipped a couple of cookies under my sleeve. I’m going to have a shower. Before I left the living room, I crouched beside Cash, dropped the cookies into his hand, and whispered into his ear, Thanks for the truck. Four texts—one asking if I’d gotten to the movie theater okay, another asking me to text her when the movie was over, then two more when she thought I was at Dairy Queen. Hope you’re having fun! Moments later: Let me know when you’re on your way home. Except that their house wasn’t my home. I texted that my battery was dying. I’d try to be back by eleven. I shoved my phone into my bag, wrapped my arms around my knees, and pressed my face against my cold skin. Was this what it was like to have a mom? Would my mom have texted all the time? I didn’t remember much about her, little things like her reading me stories and doing cute voices, the smell of her oil paints. Dad said she was easygoing and fun, but she died when I was five. Maybe she would have changed. Maybe we would have argued. Dad would say I should give Lana a chance. It wasn’t her fault she wasn’t around for most of my life. When Mom got sick, Lana had called every day, sent flowers, and she visited at the end, when Mom was dying, and stayed for the funeral. She tried to keep in touch, but Dad and I were happy doing our own thing, and by the time she did move back, we were strangers. My thoughts were broken by a scream as one of the girls leapt off the dock into the lake—a black abyss at this time of night. People stood around with flashlights and lanterns. More splashes, then laughing. Music pulsed across the water—southern rap with a lot of bass. I squeezed my eyes shut, focused on the heat coming off the bonfire, the flickering orange light. My shirt was almost dry, the bikini top string tangled in my hair, but my bottoms were still damp under my cutoffs. Someone sat beside me, bumped my shoulder. I opened one eye—then both when I realized it was Jonny. His chest was bare, tanned flesh in goose bumps, and his board shorts dripped onto the sand. He stared into the fire with his arms resting loosely on his bent knees. I dragged my fingers through the fine grains, swirled them into a motocross track. You need to improve your speed on the corners. I pushed a finger hard into a groove. I went over the video from your last race. You kept your foot on the rear brake too long. Jonny glanced down and grinned, his white teeth flashing. Thanks, Coach. He wore his dollar-store Ray-Bans on top of his wet hair, deepened from its usual soft brown to chocolate. He was letting it grow out in tousled waves, like a surfer, his sideburns blending into the shadow along his jaw. His shape felt bigger next to me. I didn’t know if it was because he was putting on more muscle from working longer hours on the farm, or because I felt so small lately. He met my eyes. You okay? Yeah. We watched the dock for a few moments. He tapped out a cigarette from a pack, squeezed it between his lips as he searched his pockets for a lighter. I frowned. He shrugged. It’s my last pack. I looked hard at the side of his face. He sighed, plucked the cigarette from his mouth, and jammed it into the sand. I took the pack from him, poured the rest of my beer over it. Jesus, Hailey. I just bought those. Dumbass. That’s my middle name. He spread his arms wide until I forced a smile. If I didn’t react, he’d keep putting himself down. I hated that as much as he hated when I was sad. I have to get back before Vaughn comes home. I still can’t believe you live with the Iceman. Tell me about it. My knees wobbled when I stood and swung my bag over my shoulder. Two beers. Enough to give me a buzz, but not so much that Lana might notice. You taking the logging road? No moon tonight. I have my flashlight. Jonny squinted at me. Maybe you should get a ride with someone. I glanced at where they were putting tents up, rolling out sleeping bags. Most of them planned to spend the night, and there wasn’t anyone I wanted to be stuck with all the way back into town. I’ll be fine. Okay, text later. He thumped my calf muscle with a soft fist. My mountain bike tires were quiet on the dirt road as I passed groups of campers sitting by their fires and propane lanterns, playing cards at a picnic table. No one noticed me. The road was pitch-black as it led out of the campground, the music fading. I leaned forward and flicked on my flashlight strapped to the handlebars. When I reached the highway, I stopped and looked both ways. No headlights. I shifted my backpack straps higher on my shoulder. I had to bike a few miles to the old logging road on the other side—a shortcut back to town. It would still take thirty minutes. My pace was easy for the first mile, but when I reached the yellow billboard, I stood up and pumped harder, my breath coming out in huffs. I didn’t like riding by the sign during the day, and it was even creepier at night, the way the women’s faces and names shimmered, the words glowing white. WOMEN—DON’T HITCHHIKE. DANGEROUS HIGHWAY! Missing posters for some of the women were still attached to stakes around the billboard like gravestones. Even the air seemed colder out here and chilled me to the bone underneath my hoodie. When the sign was behind me, I slowed my pedaling and coasted for a bit. With one hand, I grabbed my cell out of my front pocket and checked the battery. Five percent. I turned it off to save the last bit of juice. A car came over the crest, but I saw it in time, its headlights lighting up the sky. I dropped the bike in the ditch, tires still spinning, and hid behind a bush. The car passed. I got back on my bike. The highway began to slope up, a gradual hill, then it flattened out to a long bridge, with cement barriers on each side to stop vehicles from rolling into the ravine and the creek below. I was traveling faster now, wheels humming, backpack bouncing against my shoulders. It felt better to be in my body instead of my head, the exertion familiar—breathe deeply, flex my leg muscles, work against the pain. Then, halfway up the hill, a new noise. The rumble of a large vehicle. Coming fast. Headlights flooded the road in front of me. Damn—no way I could get out of sight. The pitch of the engine changed. It was slowing. Someone who knew me? One of the guys from the campground? Probably on a beer run. I glanced over my shoulder. The headlights were high and blinding. Definitely a truck, but I didn’t recognize the grille, and I couldn’t make out the driver. I turned around and kept pedaling. The truck was almost at a crawl. If it was one of the guys, they would have stuck their head out the window and said something. Unless they were trying to freak me out—in which case I was going to kick their ass. I pressed down hard with my legs and kept my gaze focused where the cement barrier ended a few yards ahead. Tires close beside me. The heat of the rubber. The scrape of the window being rolled down. I dared a glance, nearly losing control as my front tire hit a pothole. A white Chevy truck. Stripes of blue, yellow, and red down the side. Light bar on the roof. Not a creep. Just a cop patrolling the highway. My relief ended as soon as I heard the voice. Hailey? What the hell? I let the bike slow to a stop and looked through the open window. Vaughn’s face was barely lit from the dash, but I recognized the blond hair cut so short you could see his scalp, the pale blue hooded eyes, and the frown that made my stomach tighten. Were you at the lake? What was the point in answering? He already knew. There was no other reason to be out here, and the ends of my hair were damp. We locked eyes. Vaughn’s frown deepened. Put your bike in the back. I dropped the tailgate and lifted my bike into the box. He’d switched on his hazards, the red light pulsing across the road, flashing onto my arms and face. He didn’t get out to help, which was a good thing. I needed time to think how I was going to explain this. I opened the door and climbed in. He watched as I pulled on my seat belt, then blasted the heat, adjusting the vents in my direction. He put the truck in gear and pulled back onto the highway. He glanced over. Lana said you were going to a movie. We came out to the lake after. Did you tell her that? My phone died. I rubbed at my cold legs, fiddled with my necklace, carved pieces of elk bone on a leather string. Dad had given it to me. The last time I’d ridden in Vaughn’s truck was when he’d come to the house to tell me about the accident. He’d pulled in so quietly I hadn’t heard the car engine, just the knock on the door. Then his words like static on a radio. Went over the bank. Driving too fast. Died on impact. I took a few breaths, blinked away the hazy dots, and shuffled my feet. They bumped into something. A black tote bag on the floorboards. I moved it to the side. Careful. That’s camera equipment. He looked at me again. I wished he’d pay attention to the road. Every time his eyes met mine, I felt a clutch of uneasiness. Why were you alone? Everyone’s staying at the campground. I kept my gaze focused on the white line. I thought you had a meeting at the lodge. I left early. Got a domestic call. Oh. I chewed my lip, wondering if I knew the people involved. There were only summer cabins and a few farms past the lake. It was odd that Vaughn hadn’t sent another officer out on the call, considering he wasn’t even in uniform, and I was surprised he hadn’t stopped at the campsite. The Iceman loved busting kids for anything—he didn’t need an excuse to hassle us. He gave me a hard look. You been drinking? I’m underage. I dropped my head against the seat and closed my eyes partway. The seat fabric smelled like oranges, something citrus, but with an earthy undertone. A woman’s perfume? It didn’t smell like Lana. Maybe he’d cleaned recently. The dash and door were shiny. I glanced at him from the side. His square jaw jutting out, that long stare down his nose, his large hands flexing on the wheel. Jonny said Vaughn liked to make people feel powerless, and it worked. Ever since I’d moved into his house, I felt like I had to get everything approved by him. Don’t bullshit me. I can smell the beer. Dad wouldn’t care. For God’s sake, Hailey. You know how many girls ruin their lives when they hit your age? They hang out with the wrong guys, drink, do drugs. Not me. Sure. He laughed. And Jonny Miller’s a saint. Been a few thefts lately. If we raided his dad’s farm right now, bet you we’d find all kinds of stolen dirt bike parts. My stomach did a hard flip. The truck felt hot. Vaughn’s cologne mixed sickeningly with that fruity perfume smell. He paused, let out a frustrated sigh. Listen, you think you’re all grown up, but Cold Creek is rough. I’ve seen a lot of bad things, okay? It’s easy to get into trouble around here. Someone like you, a pretty girl without a dad, you have to be even more careful. I stared out the window. Dad used to call me pretty, but he didn’t sound like that when he said it. Like it was a bad thing. How you look, what you wear, it attracts attention. Vaughn shifted in his seat. I glanced over. He was looking down at my cutoffs. People get the wrong idea. Heat climbed my throat, my face. Why was he saying these things? My shorts weren’t tight or cut too high. Half the girls in town wore them so the front pockets showed. I was only on the highway for a few minutes. I was going to take the logging road. You think someone can’t kill you in a few minutes? Nobody’s going to kill me. I tried not to roll my eyes, but he must have heard the sneer in my voice, because his head snapped around. You think this is funny? Lana’s friend was murdered on this highway, remember? She was just having fun at the lake too, and look what happened to her. She was hitchhiking, I mumbled. It was a long time ago. Yeah, and more girls have been killed since, so while you’re living with us, there will be no more parties, and no more lake. "Like ever?" Not without me or Lana. That’s crazy. Why can’t— That’s the rule. If you break it, I’ll lock up your bike, understand? I clenched my jaw so tight I could feel my teeth grinding together. He’d been wanting me out of my room, so I finally go out for a couple of hours, and this is what I get? Served me right for thinking anything could be the same again. I should have stayed in bed. We drove in silence until we were off the highway and through the quiet neighborhood where they lived. He pulled to a stop at the end of their street by the mailboxes. I could just see the white trim of their house in the distance. I looked over, confused. It was dark in the truck with the dashboard lights off. His body close. He was big, his shoulders bunched. He had turned the radio down. I didn’t remember him doing that. I’m going to the station to fill out a report. He stretched his arm across the back of the seat and twisted toward me. I’ll keep tonight’s adventure between us. You’re not going to tell Lana? What was going on? He’d just handed down his stupid rule, and now he was giving me a pass? Your aunt doesn’t need more problems. She has enough to deal with, don’t you think? Right. Another mouth to feed. A headache. A kid neither of them wanted. I nodded. Good girl. He patted my leg, then reached across me. I flinched, pressed back against the seat. The door swung open. Go on. I’ll wait until you get into the house. I slipped out of the truck, closing the door softly so that I didn’t wake Lana in case she was sleeping, and got my bike. It wasn’t until I reached the front steps that I heard the truck drive off. When I glanced over my shoulder, I caught a flash of red taillights through the trees. Lana was curled up in a chair in the living room, book in hand, her face lit with a soft glow from the lamp. Hi, sweetie. She gave me a warm smile. You have a good time? I hovered in the doorway. I wanted to get to the bedroom and put this entire night behind me. "Yeah. Sorry I’m late.
