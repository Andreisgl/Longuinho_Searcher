Text-to-Speech allows developers to create natural-sounding,
synthetic human speech as playable audio. You can use the audio data
files you create using Text-to-Speech to power your applications or
augment media like videos or audio recordings (in compliance with the
Google Cloud Platform Terms of Service including compliance
with all applicable law).
Text-to-Speech converts text or Speech
Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) input into audio data like MP3 or
LINEAR16 (the encoding used in WAV files).
This document is a guide to the fundamental concepts of using
Text-to-Speech. Before diving into the API itself, review the
quickstarts.
Basic example
Text-to-Speech is ideal for any application that plays audio of
human speech to users. It allows you to convert arbitrary strings, words, and
sentences into the sound of a person speaking the same things.
Imagine that you have a voice assistant app that provides natural language
feedback to your users as playable audio files. Your app might take an action
and then provide human speech as feedback to the user.
For example, your app may want to report that it successfully added an event
to the user's calendar. Your app constructs a response string to report
the success to the user, something like "I've added the event to your
calendar."
With Text-to-Speech, you can convert that response string to
actual human speech to play back to the user, similar to the example provided
below.
  Your browser does not support the audio element.
Example 1. Audio file generated from Text-to-Speech
To create an audio file like example 1, you send a request to
Text-to-Speech like the following code snippet.
Note: The following sample uses the
gcloud auth application-default print-access-token command to retrieve an
authorization token for the request. You must already have
gcloud installed to run the
code sample.curl -H "Authorization: Bearer "$(gcloud auth application-default print-access-token) -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" --data "{
  'input':{
    'text':'I\'ve added the event to your calendar.'
  },
  'voice':{
    'languageCode':'en-gb',
    'name':'en-GB-Standard-A',
    'ssmlGender':'FEMALE'
  },
  'audioConfig':{
    'audioEncoding':'MP3'
  }
}" "https://texttospeech.googleapis.com/v1/text:synthesize"
Speech synthesis
The process of translating text input into audio data is called synthesis and
the output of synthesis is called synthetic speech.
Text-to-Speech takes two types of input: raw text or SSML-formatted
data (discussed below). To create a new audio file, you call the
synthesize endpoint of the API.
The speech synthesis process generates raw audio data as a base64-encoded
string. You must decode the base64-encoded string into an audio file before
an application can play it. Most platforms and operating systems have
tools for decoding base64 text into playable media files.
Note: You must decode the base64 string returned from Text-to-Speech
before you can play it. For more information about how to decode base64
data, see
Decoding Base64-Encoded Audio Content
To learn more about synthesis, review the
quickstarts or the
Creating Voice Audio Files page.
Voices
Text-to-Speech creates raw audio data of natural, human speech.
That is, it creates audio that sounds like a person talking. When
you send a synthesis request to Text-to-Speech, you must
specify a voice that 'speaks' the words.
Text-to-Speech has a wide selection of custom voices available
for you to use. The voices differ by language, gender, and accent (for some
languages). For example, you can create audio that mimics the sound
of a female English speaker with a British accent like example 1, above.
You can also convert the same text into a different voice, say a male
English speaker with an Australian accent.
  Your browser does not support the audio element.
Example 2. Audio file generated with en-AU speaker
To see the complete list of the available voices, see
Supported Voices.
WaveNet voices
Along with other, traditional synthetic voices,
Text-to-Speech also provides premium, WaveNet-generated
voices. Users find the Wavenet-generated voices to be more warm and
human-like than other synthetic voices.
The key difference to a WaveNet voice is the WaveNet model used to generate
the voice. WaveNet models have been trained using raw audio samples of actual
humans speaking. As a result, these models generate synthetic speech with
more human-like emphasis and inflection on syllables, phonemes, and words.
Compare the following two samples of synthetic speech.
  Your browser does not support the audio element.
Example 3. Audio file generated with a standard voice
  Your browser does not support the audio element.
Example 4. Audio file generated with a WaveNet voice
To learn more about the benefits of WaveNet-generated voices, see
WaveNet and Other Synthetic Voices.
Other audio output settings
Besides the voice, you can also configure other aspects of the audio
data output created by speech synthesis. Text-to-Speech
supports configuring the speaking rate, pitch, volume, and sample
rate hertz.
Review the AudioConfig reference for more information.
Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) support
You can enhance the synthetic speech produced by Text-to-Speech
by marking up the text using Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML). SSML
enables you to insert pauses, acronym pronunciations, or other additional
details into the audio data created by Text-to-Speech.
Text-to-Speech supports a
subset of the available SSML elements.
Note: Text-to-Speech does not support all SSML elements for all
available languages.
For example, you can ensure that the synthetic speech correctly pronounces
ordinal numbers by providing Text-to-Speech with SSML input that marks
ordinal numbers as such.
  Your browser does not support the audio element.
Example 5. Audio file generated from plain text input
  Your browser does not support the audio element.
Example 6. Audio file generated from SSML input
To learn more about how to synthesize speech from SSML, see
Creating Voice Audio Files
