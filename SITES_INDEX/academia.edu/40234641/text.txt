This proposal encourages academics—specialists, comparativists, and generalists alike—to reflect not only on the contexts of Arabic literary production (i.e., the context of the text, author, language, etc.) but also on the social relations in which educators, their students, classrooms, and institutions are enmeshed with the translation, circulation, deployment, and reading of Arabic texts within any given political moment. In exploring teaching Arabic literature in translation, this chapter takes a decolonial approach where the students and instructor not only locate themselves in regards to the text and the origins of that Arabic text (for example, in the age of the Cold War, the American Unipolar World, or post-American Empire). But also, the pedagogical thoughtfulness considers ideological constructs of reading and writing (the commuting between the context, history and contact points of Arabic and English) that might be mutually untranslatable but also could yield ways to decenter the coloniality of the learning process in US higher education and its experience with the Global South.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
