Several VEP abnormalities were found: at vertex and to a lesser extent at temporal sites, P100-N120 amplitudes were larger in patients; at vertex and temporal sites N120 amplitudes were larger in patients; at temporal sites patents had larger N120-P200 amplitudes butSave to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In 3 studies phasic activity to moderate intensity sounds of patients on no drugs or phenothiazines was predominantly hyper- or hypo-responsive. Controls showed moderate or slow habituation. Propranolol was found to facilitate habituation in slow habituators and to reinstate responses in half of non-responders, especially when given as the sole drug. The effects seldom had a counterpart in changes in non-specific responses or levels of skin conductance. Modulatory influences on stimulus and response processing and on lateral asymmetries in responses may underlie propranolol&amp;amp;amp;#39;s efficacy in treating schizophrenia.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Subjects studied a visual word/non-word that was followed by the brief presentation of a prime letter (e.g. House, M) with the instruction to anticipate the word/non-word formed by replacing the word&amp;#39;s first letter with the prime letter. After the prime letter, an auditory target word/non-word was presented that either matched/mismatched expectations (e.g., Mouse/Barn). ERPs were recorded to the onset of the auditory targets and scalp topographical maps were derived for the phonological mismatch negativity (PMN). The PMN reflected phonological analysis and examination of the peak topography revealed that the response was characterized by a prominent frontal, right-asymmetrical distribution. Spatial de-blurring (using current source density maps) indicated that the PMN scalp topography resulted primarily from an active left anterior source. The current results provide the initial evidence for the localization of the intra-cranial generator(s) involved in phonological analysis.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Reading comprehension abilities of 23 healthy undergraduate students were evaluated using ERPs. The results revealed a differential ERP response pattern for correct and incorrect test items. These response patterns were observed at individual participant levels. The findings provided further support for the use of ERPs in the neuropsychological assessment of patients who are difficult or impossible to assess using behavioral responses because of concomitant motoric and/or communicative limitations.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Equally common is the inability to assess intellectual functioning in many communication-impaired populations because the aphasia and physical disability of such patients prevents measurable performance on traditionally administered tests of mental functioning. This study demonstrates that concept formation abilities can be assessed using event-related brain potentials. It also provides further evidence for the efficacy of this innovative assessment method in which standardized and validated psychometric tests are formatted for computer presentation and simultaneous recording of neural activity, which serves as the response measure in lieu of verbal/behavioral responses.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

However, many of these patients are difficult or impossible to assess because of aphasia and physical disabilities that prevent their performance on traditionally administered tests of mental functioning. We present normative evidence obtained from healthy individuals for the efficacy of a new method of assessing such patients using standardized and validated tests formatted for computer presentation and using direct measures of brain activity (event-related brain potentials, ERP) as the measurable response instead of verbal or motor behavior.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This event-related potential-computerized cognitive problem-solving task does not require a child to give a verbal or motor (ie, pointing) response. The event-related potential waveforms were recorded from 20 typically developing children. Two nonverbal, problem-solving tasks (tasks 1 and 2) were developed for each of two age groups (5 and 6 years). For each task, single pictures, taken from an existing standardized test of nonverbal problem solving, were individually and sequentially presented on a computer screen. One of the seven pictures was classified as incongruent or outside category; it did not belong with the other pictures. As predicted, the event-related potential amplitudes were significantly larger to the outside- versus within-category pictures. This effect was found for tasks 1 and 2 for the 5- and 6-year-old children. Children as young as 5 years of age reliably exhibit brain activity, which can be used to infer cognitive problem-solving skill. This assessment paradigm may eventually serve as a clinically useful adjunct to a thorough neurologic and neurodevelopmental assessment of selected pediatric populations, such as those presenting with moderate-severe cerebral palsy whose expressive language and motor skills are notably impaired.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Drawing from aspects in our normative study on musical emotion perception, we show how a group of participants who would normally be considered a control group in most studies, display clear event-related potential (ERP) differences when grouped by affective assessment scores that are rarely administered to presumed “control” group candidates. This preliminary finding demonstrates the importance of careful screening of control group membership. Failure in this process can produce misleading observations, undermining the validity of results.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
