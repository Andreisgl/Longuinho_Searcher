This research observed the improvements in non-skilled swimmers taught by two specific training programs. The first aimed to have a drag reduction and a better glide (improving the balance, the position in the water and the breath control). The second program aimed to improve the efficiency of the propulsive actions (with respect to continuity and length of the armstroke, rhythm of the actions). The two perfection methods were proposed to 97 non skilled subjects. In the pre-post analysis within each group an improvement of the efficiency index in all male subjects and in the females working on propulsion were found. Moreover and an improvement of long distance swim was recorded in all subjects.Download Free PDFView PDFAnalysis and comparison of results of the Mader test in different strokes in agonistic swimmersRaffaele ScuratiSeveral studies were performed to analyze both the blood lactate concentration after competitions and to set the optimal intensity level during the training. The aim of this study was to evaluate the differences in lactate production between high level male and female four-strokes-swimmers and the differences in lactate concentrations among these strokes in swimmers of the same gender. Forty male and forty female swimmers performed a modified Mader test in their own discipline. The time for 200m at the threshold speed, the [La-] peak and the [La-]/time at the anaerobic threshold ratio were considered. Male athletes produced more lactate for each stroke than the female counterparts. The higher peak lactate concentration in the male athletes were found in breaststroke, whereas in females athletes the higher peak was found in butterfly.Download Free PDFView PDFSwimming and training : comparison between heuristic and prescriptive learningRaffaele ScuratiDownload Free PDFView PDFAnalysis on learning the front crawl stroke by use or non-use of instructional flotation devicesRaffaele ScuratiA current methodological problem for Italian swimming teachers is the suitability of the instructional flotation devices as a useful tool for the learning process of swimming. In literature, there are several studies reporting contrasting results in the use of these aids. The present study analyses the results of the front crawl stroke learning process in Italian children aged 8-9 years after a 10 lessons program developed by the use or nonuse of instructional flotation devices. Both a qualitative (by MERS-F scale) and a quantitative (armstroke cycles, breathings, stroke rate, stroke length, efficiency index) analyses were performed. No significant differences between the two methods were found.Download Free PDFView PDFAnalysis and comparison of some aquatic motor behaviors in young childrenRaffaele ScuratiSeveral studies considered aquatic motor sequences in young children and their relations with some aspects of aquatic psychomotor development. The aim of this study was to understand if spontaneous swim movements of the child can evolve into an effective action, after a “keep doing” and a “free exploration” based methodological approach. Three groups of ten children, different in age (4-12 months, 12-24 months, 24-36 months), were studied. The presence of some motor skills pre and post a period of 10 events of free experience in a swimming pool were detected. No differences were found in the prepost comparison within each group. Differences resulted in the comparison of the children aged 4-12 versus 24-36 months and in the children aged 12-24 versus 24-36 months.Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of Human KineticsThe Effect of Course Length on Individual Medley Swimming Performance in National and International Athletes2014 • Thomas RosemannDownload Free PDFView PDFComparisons of four competitive jammers by biomechanics and physiological parameters in expert male crawl swimmersJoão Vilas-boas, D. Chollet, Pierre-Marie LeprêtreIntroduction The evolution of rules about competitive swimsuits require updating the scientific data: for example, the biomechanics or physiological consequences of compressive character are not homogeneous (Benjanuvatra et al, 2002, Chollet et al, 2010, Marinho et al 2011, Tomikawa et al, 2009). The aim of this study was to compare four different competitive jammers relative to the personal usual training swimsuit in well-trained swimmers. Method Twenty male expert crawl swimmers participated in this study. Experimentation 1: Ten participants (G1: 603±75 FINA points, 19.5±2.7 years, 183.6±5.1 cm and 71.2±7.5 kg) performed five randomised exercise sessions (jammer JA, JB, JC, JD and a control SS). Each session involved all-out 200-m crawl and 50-m leg trials after a standardised warm-up. During each session, measures of speed, arm frequency, amplitude and heart rate were continuously recorded during each trial. Anthropometric data, buoyancy, glide and blood lactate were analysed bef...Download Free PDFView PDFNavy SEALFitness GuideKaralis Xtreme A.S.D.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
