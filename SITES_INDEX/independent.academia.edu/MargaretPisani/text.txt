Risk Factors for Continuation of Atypical Antipsychotics at Hospital Discharge in Two Intensive Care Unit CohortsClinical Medicine Insights: PsychiatryIntroduction: Atypical antipsychotics are frequently initiated in the intensive care unit (ICU) t... more Introduction: Atypical antipsychotics are frequently initiated in the intensive care unit (ICU) to treat delirium. Many patients continue on these agents at hospital discharge despite a lack of data to support long-term use. Objectives: The primary aim of this study was to determine underlying risk factors for continuation of antipsychotics at hospital discharge in medical intensive care unit (MICU) and surgical intensive care unit (SICU) patients when evaluated as separate cohorts. Methods: A single-center, retrospective study in patients newly initiated on quetiapine, risperidone, or olanzapine in a 22-bed mixed medical-surgical ICU admitted from January 2017 to July 2018. Results: A total of 78 (62.9%) MICU patients and 46 (37.1%) SICU patients met the inclusion criteria during this time frame. A total of 29 MICU patients (37.2%) were prescribed antipsychotics at hospital discharge compared to 25 SICU patients (54.3%), P = .063.

These factors are potentially modifiable. We tested the impact of an intensive care unit (ICU) sleep promotion protocol on overnight in-room disturbance.MethodsOur protocol restricted non-urgent bedside care from 00:00 to 03:59. Patients were assigned to usual care (n=30) or the sleep protocol (n=26). The primary outcomes were measures of in-room activity, sound and light. These three types of disturbance were compared between arms during a baseline time block (20:00–23:59) and a rest time block (00:00–03:59). We assessed the sleep protocol effect with generalised linear models.ResultsUsual care and sleep protocol patients had equivalent levels of in-room activity, sound and light during the baseline time block (20:00–23:59). In contrast, during the rest time block (00:00–03:59), the sleep protocol arm had 32% fewer room entries (rate ratio (RR) 0.68, p...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Our objective was to prospectively evaluate the relationship between frailty and post-ICU disability, incident nursing home (NH) admission, and death. The parent cohort included 754 adults aged ≥70, who were evaluated monthly for disability in 13 functional activities and every 18 months for frailty (1998-2014). Frailty was assessed using the Fried index, where frailty, pre-frailty and non-frailty were defined, respectively, as ≥3, 1-2, and 0 criteria (of 5). The analytic sample included 391 ICU admissions. The mean age was 84.0 years. Frailty and pre-frailty were present prior to 213 (54.5%) and 140 (35.8%) of the 391 admissions, respectively.

Using a community-engaged approach, we partnered with a community health center in New Haven, CT to conduct in-person interviews and a written survey of asthmatic adults with poor symptom control. Using the constant comparative method, we analyzed participant interviews to establish emerging themes and identify common barriers to improved outcomes. Through a written survey utilizing clinically validated questions, we assessed information on access to medical care, asthma control, and selected social and environmental risk factors. Twenty-one patients (mean age 47, 62% female, 71% Black, 95% insured by Medicaid) participated. The average Asthma Control Test (ACT) score was 11.6. Seventy-six percent of participants were currently employed and of those, 75% reported work-related symptoms. Among participants currently in housing, 59% reported exposure to domiciliary mice and 47% to mold. We identified three themes that summarize the challenges the study participants face: 1) Lack of knowledge about home and workplace asthma triggers; 2) Lack of awareness of legal rights or resources available to mitigate adverse conditions in the home or work environment; and 3) Fear of retaliation from landlords or employers, including threats of eviction, sexual assault, and job loss. Patients with poorly controlled asthma in a disadvantaged urban northeast community identified common barriers in both the domestic and work environments that impeded attainment of symptom control. These challenges may be best addressed through legal advocacy for those most at risk.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

To examine the clinical significance of miR-1 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and its specific role in tumor endothelium. miR-1 levels were measured by Taqman assay. Endothelial cells were isolated by magnetic sorting. We used vascular endothelial cadherin promoter to create a vascular-specific miR-1 lentiviral vector and an inducible transgenic mouse. KRAS/Trp (KP) mice, lung-specific vascular endothelial growth factor transgenic mice, Lewis lung carcinoma xenografts, and primary endothelial cells were used to test the effects of miR-1. In two cohorts of patients with NSCLC, miR-1 levels were lower in tumors than the cancer-free tissue. Tumor miR-1 levels correlated with the overall survival of patients with NSCLC. miR-1 levels were also lower in endothelial cells isolated from NSCLC tumors and tumor-bearing lungs of KP mouse model. We examined the significance of lower miR-1 levels by testing the effects of vascular-specific miR-1 overexpression. Vector-mediated delivery or transgenic overexpression of miR-1 in endothelial cells decreased tumor burden in KP mice, reduced the growth and vascularity of Lewis lung carcinoma xenografts, and decreased tracheal angiogenesis in vascular endothelial growth factor transgenic mice. In endothelial cells, miR-1 level was regulated through phosphoinositide 3-kinase and specifically controlled proliferation, de novo DNA synthesis, and ERK1/2 activation. Myeloproliferative leukemia oncogene was targeted by miR-1 in the lung endothelium and regulated tumor growth and angiogenesis. Endothelial miR-1 is down-regulated in NSCLC tumors and controls tumor progression and angiogenesis.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Endobronchial Ultrasound-Guided Cautery-Assisted Transbronchial Forceps Biopsies: Safety and Sensitivity Relative to Transbronchial Needle AspirationThe Annals of Thoracic Surgery,  2016Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) is important in th... more Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) is important in the evaluation of thoracic lymphadenopathy. Reliably providing excellent diagnostic yield for malignancy, its diagnosis of sarcoidosis is inconsistent. Furthermore, TBNA may not suffice when larger &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;core biopsy&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot; samples of malignant tissue are required. The primary objective of this study was to determine if the sequential use of TBNA and a novel technique called cautery-assisted transbronchial forceps biopsy (ca-TBFB) was safe. Secondary outcomes included sensitivity and successful acquisition of tissue. The study prospectively enrolled 50 unselected patients undergoing convex-probe EBUS. All lymph nodes exceeding 1 cm were sequentially biopsied under EBUS guidance using TBNA and ca-TBFB. Safety and sensitivity were assessed at the nodal level for 111 nodes. Results of each technique were also reported for each patient. There were no significant adverse events. In nodes determined to be malignant, TBNA provided higher sensitivity (100%) than ca-TBFB (78%). However, among nodes with granulomatous inflammation, ca-TBFB exhibited higher sensitivity (90%) than TBNA (33%). On the one hand, for analysis based on patients rather than nodes, 6 of the 31 patients with malignancy would have been missed or understaged if the diagnosis were based on samples obtained by ca-TBFB. On the other hand, 3 of 8 patients with sarcoidosis would have been missed if analysis were based only on TBNA samples. In some patients, only ca-TBFB acquired sufficient tissue for the core samples needed in clinical trials of malignancy. The sequential use of TBNA and ca-TBFB appears to be safe. The larger samples obtained from ca-TBFB increased its sensitivity to detect granulomatous disease and provided adequate specimens for clinical trials of malignancy when specimens from needle biopsies were insufficient. For thoracic surgeons and advanced bronchoscopists, we advocate ca-TBFB as an alternative to TBNA in select clinical scenarios.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Sleep, breathing, and menopause: the effect of fluctuating estrogen and progesterone on sleep and breathing in womenGender Medicine,  Dec 1, 2005Background: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), is more comm... more Background: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), is more common in men than in women. However, menopause increases the risk for development of OSA. Administration of estrogen and progesterone to postmenopausal women with OSA decreases apnea and hypopnea during sleep. Objective: Because beneficial changes can be observed soon after administration of a short course of hormones, we hypothesized that suppression of these hormones would rapidly result in the development of SDB. Methods: Production of sex hormones was suppressed with daily administration of leuprolide acetate (LA), a gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue, for 5 weeks in women who were participating in a study on pharmacologically induced menopause and physiology. The subjects underwent polysomnographic evaluation at baseline and after 5 weeks of LA administration. Results: In the 12 healthy women aged 18 to 34 years who participated in the study, sleep architecture and respiration were normal at baseline. After LA administration, the subjects stopped their menses, and their plasma concentrations of l7beta-estradiol (preadministration, mean [SD] 33.9 [9.0] pg/mL; post administration, 10.2 [3.4] pg/mL) and progesterone (preadministration, 0.48 [0.05] ng/mL; post administration, 0.40 [0.06] ng/mL) reached menopausal levels. Sex hormone deficiency was associated with climacteric vasomotor symptoms such as hot flashes and sweating. Sleep latencies and architecture did not change significantly with LA administration. The participants subjectively noticed some increased snoring that was not confirmed by polysomnogram. Specifically, there was no change in arousal index and no evidence for sleep fragmentation to suggest the presence of increased upper-airway resistance during sleep. The apnea-hypopnea index, 0.07 (0.02) to 0.22 (0.11) events per hour of sleep, did not change with sex hormone deficiency. Conclusions: In this study, sex hormone deficiency in young women resulted in climacteric symptoms and cessation of menses, and was not associated with sleep fragmentation or clinically significant SDB.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Prospective cohort of individuals aged 70 and older undergoing elective surgery, enrolled from June 2010 to August 2013. Two academic medical centers. Community-dwelling older adults (N = 566; mean age ± standard deviation 77 ± 5) undergoing major elective surgery and expected to be admitted for at least 3 days. Readmission was assessed in multiple interviews with participants and family members over 18 months and validated against medical record review. Physical function was assessed according to ability to perform instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) and activities of daily living (ADL), Medical Outcomes Study 12-item Short-Form Survey Physical Component Summary score, and a standardized functional composite. Two hundred fifty-five (45%) participants experienced 503 readmissions. Readmissions were associated with delays in functional recovery in all measures of p...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Endobronchial Ultrasound-Guided Cautery-Assisted Transbronchial Forceps Biopsies: Safety and Sensitivity Relative to Transbronchial Needle AspirationThe Annals of Thoracic Surgery,  2016Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) is important in th... more Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) is important in the evaluation of thoracic lymphadenopathy. Reliably providing excellent diagnostic yield for malignancy, its diagnosis of sarcoidosis is inconsistent. Furthermore, TBNA may not suffice when larger &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;core biopsy&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot; samples of malignant tissue are required. The primary objective of this study was to determine if the sequential use of TBNA and a novel technique called cautery-assisted transbronchial forceps biopsy (ca-TBFB) was safe. Secondary outcomes included sensitivity and successful acquisition of tissue. The study prospectively enrolled 50 unselected patients undergoing convex-probe EBUS. All lymph nodes exceeding 1 cm were sequentially biopsied under EBUS guidance using TBNA and ca-TBFB. Safety and sensitivity were assessed at the nodal level for 111 nodes. Results of each technique were also reported for each patient. There were no significant adverse events. In nodes determined to be malignant, TBNA provided higher sensitivity (100%) than ca-TBFB (78%). However, among nodes with granulomatous inflammation, ca-TBFB exhibited higher sensitivity (90%) than TBNA (33%). On the one hand, for analysis based on patients rather than nodes, 6 of the 31 patients with malignancy would have been missed or understaged if the diagnosis were based on samples obtained by ca-TBFB. On the other hand, 3 of 8 patients with sarcoidosis would have been missed if analysis were based only on TBNA samples. In some patients, only ca-TBFB acquired sufficient tissue for the core samples needed in clinical trials of malignancy. The sequential use of TBNA and ca-TBFB appears to be safe. The larger samples obtained from ca-TBFB increased its sensitivity to detect granulomatous disease and provided adequate specimens for clinical trials of malignancy when specimens from needle biopsies were insufficient. For thoracic surgeons and advanced bronchoscopists, we advocate ca-TBFB as an alternative to TBNA in select clinical scenarios.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Sleep, breathing, and menopause: the effect of fluctuating estrogen and progesterone on sleep and breathing in womenGender Medicine,  Dec 1, 2005Background: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), is more comm... more Background: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), is more common in men than in women. However, menopause increases the risk for development of OSA. Administration of estrogen and progesterone to postmenopausal women with OSA decreases apnea and hypopnea during sleep. Objective: Because beneficial changes can be observed soon after administration of a short course of hormones, we hypothesized that suppression of these hormones would rapidly result in the development of SDB. Methods: Production of sex hormones was suppressed with daily administration of leuprolide acetate (LA), a gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue, for 5 weeks in women who were participating in a study on pharmacologically induced menopause and physiology. The subjects underwent polysomnographic evaluation at baseline and after 5 weeks of LA administration. Results: In the 12 healthy women aged 18 to 34 years who participated in the study, sleep architecture and respiration were normal at baseline. After LA administration, the subjects stopped their menses, and their plasma concentrations of l7beta-estradiol (preadministration, mean [SD] 33.9 [9.0] pg/mL; post administration, 10.2 [3.4] pg/mL) and progesterone (preadministration, 0.48 [0.05] ng/mL; post administration, 0.40 [0.06] ng/mL) reached menopausal levels. Sex hormone deficiency was associated with climacteric vasomotor symptoms such as hot flashes and sweating. Sleep latencies and architecture did not change significantly with LA administration. The participants subjectively noticed some increased snoring that was not confirmed by polysomnogram. Specifically, there was no change in arousal index and no evidence for sleep fragmentation to suggest the presence of increased upper-airway resistance during sleep. The apnea-hypopnea index, 0.07 (0.02) to 0.22 (0.11) events per hour of sleep, did not change with sex hormone deficiency. Conclusions: In this study, sex hormone deficiency in young women resulted in climacteric symptoms and cessation of menses, and was not associated with sleep fragmentation or clinically significant SDB.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Community-based Participatory Research is Needed to Address Pulmonary Health DisparitiesAnnals of the American Thoracic Society,  2016Socioeconomic and racial disparities in the outcomes of medical management remain common across p... more Socioeconomic and racial disparities in the outcomes of medical management remain common across pulmonary diseases in the United States and worldwide. Acknowledging this context, the American Thoracic Society (ATS) recently put forth recommendations to advance respiratory health equity. Through engagement of vulnerable communities in search of collaborative solutions to improve health disparities, community-based participatory research embodies concepts essential to the ATS mission for respiratory health equity. The purpose of this commentary is to provide an overview of the principles of community-based participatory research and the application of this approach to addressing inequity in the outcomes of treatment for lung disease. Community-based participatory research aims to decrease health disparities by recognizing the social and ecological paradigms of health care and by partnering community members with academic researchers in all aspects of the research process.

Quantifying the Severity of a Delirium Episode Throughout Hospitalization: the Combined Importance of Intensity and DurationJournal of general internal medicine,  Oct 3, 2016The ability to determine which episodes of delirium are likely to lead to poor clinical outcomes ... more The ability to determine which episodes of delirium are likely to lead to poor clinical outcomes has remained a major area of challenge. To quantify delirium severity and course over an entire hospitalization using several measures, and to evaluate their predictive validity for 30- and 90-day outcomes post-discharge. Two prospective cohort studies. Analysis was conducted in two independent cohorts of adult patients aged ≥70. Nine delirium episode severity measures were examined: (1) measures reflecting delirium intensity (peak Confusion Assessment Method-Severity [CAM-S] and mean CAM-S score), (2) a measure reflecting delirium intensity and duration (sum of all CAM-S scores, sum of all CAM-S scores on delirium days only, peak CAM-S score x days with delirium), (3) measures requiring information on delirium duration and delirium at discharge (total number of delirium days, percentage of delirium days, delirium at discharge), and (4) a measure of cognitive change.
