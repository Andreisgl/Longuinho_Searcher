Police officers in particular suffer from highly negative stress related outcomes.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersConscientiousness, Work Family Conflict and Stress amongst Police officersSandiso BazanaDownload Free PDFView PDFThe Job Demands-Resources model as predictor of work identity and work engagement: A comparative analysis2011 • Roslyn de Braine, Gert RoodtDedicated employees are usually enthusiastic, inspired and have a strong identification towards their work. Such employees are regarded as being highly engaged in what they do. Dedication is regarded as one dimension of work engagement, alongside the other dimensions of work engagement, which are vigour and absorption (Bakker, Schaufeli, Leiter & Taris, 2008).Download Free PDFView PDFPredictability of big five traits in high school teacher burnout. detailed study through the disillusionment dimensionRuggero Andrisano RuggieriThis research aimed to investigate the theme of burnout syndrome in high school teachers. In particular, the objective was to verify if the five personality traits can be considered predictors of the four dimensions of burnout. The sample consisted of 171 teachers, 49 males and 122 females. For the burnout measurement, the Link Burnout Questionnaire (LBQ) was used, and for the personality measure, the Big Five Questionnaire (BFQ) was used. As predictive factors for the development of the negative polarity of Psychophysical Exhaustion, the results identify both Energy and Emotional Stability. For Relational Deterioration, the same traits emerge due to the dimension of Professional Inefficiency. For the LBM's Disillusion dimension, there was no corresponding predictive BFM trait, but by reducing the statistical error via analysis of regression with fixed effects, Agreeableness and Emotional Stability were predictive. The research confirms the relationship between personality and burnout, but future studies should both analyse the influence exerted by the contextual factors on the onset of the syndrome and deepen the research on the mental models.Download Free PDFView PDFGert Roodt Motivation for the study: Organisations operating within the 21st century face significant challengesNIc PoswaDownload Free PDFView PDFJob crafting: Towards a new model of individual job redesign2010 • Arnold BakkerErasmus University Rotterdam, Department of Work and Organizational Psychology, Woudestein, T12-59, PO Box 1738, 3000 DR Rotterdam, The Netherlands Keywords: employee engagement; individual job redesign; JD–R model; job crafting; positive organisational behaviourDownload Free PDFView PDFThe Maslach Burnout Inventory-Test ManualMaslach burnout inventory-general survey2009 • 영록 김Download Free PDFView PDFSa Journal of Industrial PsychologyThe prediction of type A behaviour: a structural equation model2009 • Gideon NiemanDownload Free PDFView PDFJournal of Criminal JusticeWork-related well-being in the South African Police Service2006 • CH KowDownload Free PDFView PDFSa Journal of Industrial PsychologyBurnout and engagement of reformed church ministers2010 • Sebastiaan RothmannDownload Free PDFView PDFWork locus of control and burnout in Polish physiotherapists: The mediating effect of coping stylesMaciej Wilski, Maciej TomczakObjectives: The aim of this study was to explain the relationship between work locus of control and burnout in Polish physiotherapists through the mediation of coping styles. In particular, we hypothesized that external work locus of control may have a positive direct relationship with burnout symptoms via positive relationship with emotion-focused and avoidant coping styles, and a negative relationship with problem-focused style. Material and Methods: We tested the mediational hypothesis using structural equation modeling of self-report data from 155 Polish physiotherapists. Results: The relationship between external work locus of control and physiotherapists’ burnout was shown to be mediated by a positive relationship with emotion-focused coping and an inverse relationship with problem-focused coping. The variables included in the model explained about 15% of the variance of emotional exhaustion, 14% of depersonalization, and 14% of personal accomplishment. Conclusions: Physiotherapists perceiving the situation as difficult to control, feel more burned out when they use more emotion-focused strategies, and less problem-focused strategies. This indicates the importance of including both, problem-focused coping training and increasing the perception of the situation controllability in preventing physiotherapists’ burnout programs.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
