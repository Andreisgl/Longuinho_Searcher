There were 64 children with at least mild symptoms of grief and/or traumatic stress and their guardians who participated in this open trial. The TF-CBT for Child Traumatic Grief protocol was adapted for use with a group, resulting in 12 weekly sessions for children and guardians separately with conjoint activities and 3 individual visits with child and guardian. Using a task-sharing approach, the intervention was delivered by lay counselors with no prior mental health experience. Primary child outcomes assessed were symptoms of grief and posttraumatic stress (PTS); secondary outcomes included symptoms of depression and overall behavioral adjustment. All assessments were conducted pretreatment, posttreatment, and 3 and 12 months after the end of treatment. Results showed improved scores on all outcomes posttreatment, sustained at 3 and 12 months. Effect sizes (Cohen's d) for baseline to posttreatment were 1.36 for child reported grief symptoms, 1.87 for child-reported PTS, and 1.15 for guardian report of child PTS.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersA Qualitative Study of Mental Health Problems Among Orphaned Children and Adolescents in Tanzania.pdfShannon DorseyDownload Free PDFView PDFEvidence Base Update for Psychosocial Treatments for Children and Adolescents Exposed to Traumatic EventsShannon DorseyDownload Free PDFView PDFCognitive-Behavioral Treatment for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder in Children and AdolescentsShannon DorseyRates of exposure to violence and traumatic events for children and adolescents are exceedingly high. In a nationally representative sample of children and adolescents in the United States, 60.4% reported exposure in the past year, with lifetime rates nearly a half to one-third higher, depending on exposure type. 1 Many children and adolescents experience repeated exposure or multiple types of events over their lifetime. 1,2 Rates of trauma exposure for youth in war-involved or high-conflict countries are even higher. 3–5 The range of potentially traumatic events includes exposure to domestic violence, child abuse and neglect, and community violence, and experiencing the violent death of a loved one, among others. A significant number of children and adolescents exposed to traumatic events develop posttraumatic stress (PTS) symptoms, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and other common trauma-related sequelae, including depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, and externalizing behavioral disorders. Rates of PTSD among children and adolescents vary, depending on the study population of focus (eg, traumatized sample vs community sample) and particular type of trauma examined (eg, sexual abuse and extreme interpersonal trauma are associated with higher rates of PTSD).

Layne, Julie  KaplowAbstract Objective. Internalizing and externalizing problems commonly co-occur with adolescent posttraumatic stress and grief reactions. However, little is known about whether these co-occurring symptoms moderate adolescents’ response to sequenced components of trauma- and grief-focused interventions. Method: Forty-four middle school students (aged 12 to 14) rated their self-identified Top Problem during a 17-week flexibly-tailored course of Trauma and Grief Component Therapy for Adolescents (TGCTA), a group-based treatment for traumatized and bereaved youth. Baseline internalizing and externalizing symptoms were examined as potential moderators of adolescents’ response to skills-building (Module I), narrative sharing (Modules II and III), and developmental progression (Module IV) phases of intervention. Results: Piecewise analyses of change during the three treatment phases indicated that adolescents with more internalizing symptoms showed significantly less improvement during the skills-building phase, and significantly more improvement during the narrative construction phase. Conclusions: Findings provide preliminary evidence that: (a) traumatized and bereaved adolescents show different trajectories of response to different TGCTA components as a function of internalizing versus externalizing baseline symptoms; and (b) assessing self-nominated problems and broad-spectrum internalizing and externalizing symptoms can guide trauma- and bereavement-informed treatment planning and monitoring.

In low-and middle-income countries most individuals with mental health problems do not receive treatment due to a shortage of mental health professionals. One approach to addressing this problem is task-sharing, in which lay counselors are trained to deliver mental health treatment. Combining this approach with a focus on EBT provides a strategy for bridging the mental health treatment gap. However, little is known about how western-developed EBTs are delivered in a culturally responsive manner. Method: Semistructured qualitative interviews were conducted with 12 TF-CBT lay counselors involved in a large randomized controlled trial of TF-CBT in Kenya and Tanzania. An inductive approach was used to analyze the data. Results: Lay counselors described the importance of being responsive to TF-CBT participants' customs, beliefs, and socioeconomic conditions and highlighted the value of TF-CBT for their community. They also discussed the importance of partnering with other organizations to address unmet socioeconomic needs. Conclusion: The findings from this study provide support for the acceptability and appropriateness of TF-CBT as a treatment approach for improving child mental health. Having a better understanding of the strategies used by lay counselors to ensure that treatment is relevant to the cultural and socioeconomic context of participants can help to inform the implementation of future EBTs.Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of Clinical Child Adolescent PsychologyA Randomized Effectiveness Study Comparing Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy With Therapy as Usual for Youth2014 • Silje S HukkelbergDownload Free PDFView PDFApplying Trauma-Focused Cognitive–Behavioral Therapy in Group FormatShannon DorseyTrauma-focused cognitive–behavioral therapy (TF-CBT), a well-established, evidence-based treatment for children who have experienced trauma, has been increasingly utilized in a group format. Group therapy formats are appealing because they can be highly effective and have the potential to reach larger numbers of clients. Moreover, TF-CBT group delivery may be particularly valuable in reducing the feelings of shame, isolation, and stigma experienced by youth and their caregivers in the aftermath of traumatic experiences. This article reviews the group TF-CBT research, discusses the therapeutic benefits of TF-CBT therapy groups, and provides clinical and logistical guidance for implementing TF-CBT in group format, including a session-by-session protocol. Future directions for research and clinical work in this area are also discussed.Download Free PDFView PDFClinical Case StudiesTrauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Applied to Childhood Traumatic Grief in the Aftermath of a Motor-Vehicle Accident: A School-Based Case Study2014 • Kurt MichaelDownload Free PDFView PDFChild and Adolescent Exposure to Trauma2013 • Elizabeth TantObjectives:To assess the effectiveness of interventions that target traumatic stress symptoms and syndromes among children exposed to trauma other than maltreatment or family violence (Key Question 1 [KQ 1]), or children exposed to trauma other than maltreatment or family violence who already have symptoms (KQ 2); to identify subgroup characteristics that moderate the effect of an intervention on outcomes (KQ 3); and to assess harms associated with interventions (KQ 4).Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
