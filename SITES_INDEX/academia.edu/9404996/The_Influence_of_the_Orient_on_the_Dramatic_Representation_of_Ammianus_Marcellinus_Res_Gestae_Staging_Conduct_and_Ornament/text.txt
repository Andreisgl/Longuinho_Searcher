The fictionalization of the account and the use of the rhetoric, aided by many contrasts, ominous prolepses, defined characterizations, theatrical re-enactments, and details (rather than facts) which converge to make a banal historical reality but one that is attractive for the reader, will mask a historical truth, but they serve the ultimate aim of the historian: the decadence of Rome was not only due to Adrianopolis, but to the loss of the moral values that made it great. In sum, a good example of fictionalized history.Download Free PDFView PDF‘The Body Politic: Performing Character in Ammianus Marcellinus’, in E. Amato, P. De Cicco, & T.

Cet article examine un aspect souvent négligé ou mal compris de son récit : les descriptions physiques de ses protagonistes. La lecture de ces descriptions, à la lumière de la pensée tardo-antique de la physionomie, du geste et du comportement, suggère qu’elles offrent une forme cohérente de caractérisation, à travers laquelle Ammien met en évidence les jugements moraux qu’il offre sur les individus qui peuplent son histoire.Download Free PDFView PDFAmmianus, Jovian and the Syriac Julian Romance, Journal of Late Antiquity 4.2 (2011), pp. 280-297Jan Willem DrijversDownload Free PDFView PDFKilling Julian: The Death of an Emperor and the Religious History of the Later Roman EmpireBenjamin RogaczewskiThis thesis addresses an intriguing question concerning the death of emperor Julian, known throughout history as “the Apostate.” Although Julian ruled for less than two years, his reign and death were the center of debate for centuries. Ancient writers composed different death narratives for the last “pagan” emperor, elaborating upon certain details in the narratives and adding portions, probably fictionalized, of the story where they thought necessary. It is my view that these different death narratives were used as literary loci to discuss the growing power of the church and the relations between church and state. Analysis of these narratives, written by Gregory Nazianzus, Libanius, Ammianus Marcellinus, and the ecclesiastical historians of the fifth century (Socrates of Constantinople, Sozomen of Gaza, and Theodoret of Cyrrhus) allows the historians a more nuanced view of the religious and political history of late antiquity, specifically concerning Christianization in the empire and relations between bishop and emperor, church and state. This thesis will argue that the narratives of Julian’s death, written in the fourth and fifth centuries, were colored by these two political and religious concerns of the period.Download Free PDFView PDFUnreliable Witness: Failings of the Narrative in Ammianus MarcellinusJohn WeisweilerIn this paper, I analyse the meaning of episodes of autopsy in Ammianus Marcellinus.

Thanks to the availability of primary sources, the Nisibis War lends itself to a detailed analysis, from the strategic conferences of emperors, the field tactics of generals, the heroics of tribunes and the unscrupulous activities of spies, scoundrels, villains, and usurpers. While development of the strategy was simple its implementation was plagued by lack of resources, undermined by the actions of traitors and usurpers and ultimately derailed by King Shapur II and the Royal Persian Army.Download Free PDFView PDFImperatores litterati and imperatores illitterati in the Latin abbreviators of the 4th century A. D.Catherine Schneider, Valérie PageauLatin literature of the 4th century A. D. is defined, amongst other things, by the production of compendiums of Roman history (breviarium, epitoma or periochae). These are often commissioned works, written by court historians, sometimes at the request of the emperor himself. These short histories were written by former teachers, grammarians or rhetoricians who reached the highest ranks of the imperial administration, as did Eutropius and Aurelius Victor. These works observe new and particular rules, imposed by their famous dedicatees. Their purpose is usually practical and didactic : they present the imperial deeds of times passed in a concise and chronological manner. Three of them – Eutropius’ Breviarium, Aurelius Victor’s Liber de Caesaribus and the Pseudo-Aurelius Victor’s Epitome de Caesaribus – focus on the emperor’s culture and education as the cornerstones of any civilised governance : they present recurring observations on the paideia of the princes. In these portraits, emperors are men of letters and/or men of war, athletic and/or intellectual, bilingual or not, educated or ignorant. While they are rulers, they can also be orators, philosophers, poets, jurists, and sometimes even artists. In the literary works, the imperial imagery is reflected in a series of pictures presented to the emperors in charge. These « mirrors for the princes » make us wonder about the mentality and the ideology lying behind the texts. The present communication proposes to determine if the concepts developed by the modern theories of imagology can be used to study the culture of the emperors and its representations in the 4th century. Can the paideia of the princes be examined based on the terms of psychology, sociology, ethnicity and geography (Roman vs Spanish, African, Illyrian, etc.), and even, dynasty (Constantinians, Valentinians, Theodosians vs Julio-Claudians, Flavians, Antonines, etc.) ? In other words, can the stereotypes that define the culture of the Greco-Roman man be applied in the same way to the emperor, or does holding the power erase these clichés and prerequisites ?Download Free PDFView PDFUnder this sign you shall be the ruler!  Eusebius, the Chi-Rho letters and the archê of ConstantineFernando López SánchezAbstract According to the Christian Eusebius, Constantine saw a sign in the sky in the form of a cross shortly before the battle of the Milvian Bridge on October 28 of AD 312, and thanks to this he defeated his enemy Maxentius. According to Lactantius, also a Christian, what Constantine actually saw in the sky were the letters Chi-Rho, and not the form of a cross. This article aims to show that the Chi-Rho monogram should be understood as a contraction of the Greek words archē (“origin” and “sovereignity”) or archōn (“chief” and “commander”). Constantine’s vision of the Chi-Rho monogram in the sky may be related to earlier visions in both the Macedonian world and Rome, according to which Jupiter would recognise, after a number of solar interventions, the primacy of the favoured sovereigns over their competitors. The article also argues that the Bosphorus city of Constantinople, the favourite of Constantine as well as that of his legacy and his descendants, was also the city of the archē of Constantine. A study covering both the Hellenistic education of Eusebius and a number of Hellenistic and Roman coin series attempts to demonstrate that the vision at the Milvian Bridge recounted in the Vita Constantini was modelled on Hellenistic and Roman precedents well known to the author. Keywords Chi-Rho. Constantine. Dialogue with God(s). Army. Eusebius. Jupiter. Medallion. Coin. Resumen Según el cristiano Eusebio, Constantino vio una señal en el cielo en forma de cruz poco antes de la batalla del Puente Milvio el 28 de octubre del año 312, y gracias a ella derrotó a su enemigo Majencio. Según Lactancio, también cristiano, lo que realmente vio Constantino en el cielo fueron las letras Chi-Rho y no la forma de una cruz. Este artículo pretende mostrar que el monograma Chi-Rho debe ser entendido como una contracción de las palabras griegas archē (“origen” y “soberanía”) o archōn (“jefe” y “comandante”). La visión de Constantino del monograma Chi-Rho en el cielo puede estar relacionado con visiones anteriores en el mundo macedonio y en Roma, según las cuales Júpiter reconocería, después de una serie de intervenciones solares, la primacía de determinados soberanos favorecidos por delante de sus competidores. El artículo también discute que la ciudad de Constantinopla en el Bósforo, la favorita de Constantino, así como de su herencia y de sus descendientes, fue también la ciudad de la archē de Constantino. Un análisis tanto de la educación helenística de Eusebio, como de varias series de monedas helenísticas y romanas intenta demostrar que la visión del Puente Milvio relatada en la Vita Constantini estaba modelada según precedentes romanos y helenísticos bien conocidos por el autor.
