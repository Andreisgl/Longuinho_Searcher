In his talk, Le Gales presented new empirical qualitative data collected through a comparative research of 480 professionals and managers in 16 neighbourhoods in 4 cities (Paris, Lyon, Madrid, Milan + background data on London and Manchester). This data reveals the upper middle class is transnational only to a limited degree (and substantially less than speculated by some social theorists), mostly adopting partial exit strategies – thus refuting simplistic arguments about the rise of mobility, new barbarians (Agnell) and rootedness of European Bourgeoisie. However, despite expressing strong criticism of simplistic understanding of mobility patterns, gentrification and disembeddedness in Europe, Le Gales himself made some bold statements and generalising interpretations that lead to misleading conclusions.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersWorking papers du Programme Villes & territoires, Sciences PoNot barbarians : Transnational mobility and Rootedness of Upper Middle classes in European Cities2010 • Francisco Javier Moreno FuentesDownload Free PDFView PDFGlobalising European Urban Bourgeoisies? Rooted middle classes and partial exit in Paris, Lyon, Madrid and Milan Alberta Andreotti, Patrick Le GalèsIntroduction to a fothcoming book: This book aims at empirically testing the role of urban upper middle classes in the transformations experienced by contemporary European societies, linking our analysis to the debate on the emergence of a transnational bourgeoisie. In this book we argue (and try to provide empirical evidence to prove) that these groups are becoming at the same time more cosmopolitan AND more locally rooted. European urban upper middle classes have to be analysed in relation to their strategies to gain resources from the international world, and to escape the constraints of national society, while remaining part of it (we call this “partial exit”). MEANWHILE, they are also part of urban societies, remain deeply rooted at the local level, and develop strategies to mix with other social and ethnic groups in some domains, while staying away and increasing distance in some others. Beyond simple analysis of secession or gentrification, this book makes sense of this “partial exit” logic both from the national and from the urban point of view. We argue that European urban middle classes are becoming more mobile, partially “exiting” from the national society, and we bring evidence of this (friends, networks, children, jobs, holidays, values). They also invest resources in the cities and neighbourhoods where they live, they only look for secession or gated communities strategies in certain contexts, but remain in control of the social and spatial distance they want to keep in relation to diverse social and ethnic groups.  Is a new European managerial service class in the making in European metropolis in relation to European/global processes?  Is there some pattern of social differentiation emerging, is this segment of the population adopting “exit” or “partial exit” strategies in respect to the nation state?  Is this segment of the population adopting “exit” or “partial exit” strategies emerging from urban practices and attempts to “exit” from the urban fabric?Download Free PDFView PDFGlobal Networks Vol. 13 (1): 41-59 (ISSN: 1470-2266; DOI: 10.1111/j.1471-0374.2012.00365.x).Transnational mobility and rootedness:  the upper middle classes in European cities 2013 • Francisco Javier Moreno FuentesSome authors argue that ‘mobilities’ form the distinctive feature of late modern societies and represent a new social cleavage between cosmopolitan mobile élites and urban residents more rooted in their local neighbourhoods. One assumption in contemporary discourses of rootedness is that this new transnational or global society entails an ongoing process of uprooting individuals and a mainly mobile élite packing up and relocating. In this article, we draw on empirical comparative research to examine the patterns and dynamics of mobility and belonging across European borders among upper-middle-class managers in four cities – Paris, Madrid, Milan and Lyon. We suggest that these new urban upper-middle-class managers display flight responses, or ‘partial exit’ strategies, which operate at various levels to enable them to protect and control their interests while holding onto the reins of power in their local communities. Our study adopts a micro-level perspective to explore individual experiences, strategies, motivations and values based on interviews with 480 managers in these cities.Download Free PDFView PDFSecurity/Mobility: Politics of movementStef WittendorpSecurity/Mobility brings together research that examines the political regulation of movement with research that engages the material enablers of and constraints on such movement. It bridges theoretical perspectives from critical security studies and political geography in order to provide a more comprehensive perspective on security and mobility. In this vein, the book brings together approaches to mobility that take into account both techniques and practices of regulating movement, as well as their underlying infrastructures. Together they form a perspective on a politics of movement that is underpinned and shaped by a politics of security. This collection covers a broad range of topics, united by their goal to contribute to a more detailed perspective on a presumably mobile and insecure world. The title Security/Mobility is a direct reference to a world that appears dominated by these two paradigms. Demonstrated throughout the book security and mobility are not opposed to each other. To the contrary, a great deal of the politics of movement is undertaken in order to reconcile the need for security and the necessity of mobility. This book shows how those politics cover distinct yet connected areas such as internet infrastructure, the circulation of data, discourses of borders and bordering, bureaucracy and citizenship. Together, they offer a detailed picture of the manifold regulations and underpinning imaginaries of security and mobility that we encounter today.Download Free PDFView PDFVainikka, J. (2008) Airspaces, airports and the new mobilities paradigm.  Paper presented at the Geography Graduate School Intensive Course “Re-grounding Globalization” University of Tampere, Finland 6.–7.11.2008.Joni VainikkaThe globalising world is based on movement and the mechanisms that facilitate it. According to the new mobilities paradigm we should give more attention to the mobility of people, objects, information and ideas than to the more sedentarist phenomena. In this presentation I will try to unravel the recent discussion on mobility, in which social relations necessitate intermittent and intersecting movements that create a multilayered spatiality despite distances. Airports are closely attached to the new mobilities paradigm as immobile platforms, which along with air traffic permit people to move from place to another. The terminals and airspaces are seen as the building blocks of aeromobility along with the social and technological practices, or code/spaces, and the shifting global networks, which enable flows between locations. Aeromobility is also seen as a special form of human mobility. In order to enter the airspaces passengers as well as cargo are identified and classified depending to their presumed safety. This sorting continues as the services and privileges for the paying kinetic elite and special surveillance of other groups. The sorting develops complex social groupings, but the airport also changes locality into emblematic collections of regional and national culture and identity. Souvenirs and symbolic landscapes remind of the location amidst the airport shopping mall. The mobility turn along with increasing socio-cultural inquiry on airports and airspaces is altering the perception of airports only as non-places or as culturally void.Download Free PDFView PDFSocietaMutamentoPoliticaSpatial Mobility in Social Theory2019 • Aurore FlipoWhile the concept of ‘mobility’ lends itself to a variety of metaphorical meanings, ‘spatial mobility’ is in fact poorly theorized in the history of sociology. Nonetheless, it plays an underrated role in the theories of all the classics of the discipline: Marx and Engels, Weber, Durkheim, Simmel, and the Chicago School. The paper explores the role of ‘spatial mobility’ in these classics and its re-emerging importance in more recent social theory. The influence of geography is highlighted, as John Urry’s ‘mobility turn’ draws on the earlier ‘spatial turn’ of human geographers. After reviewing the controversy about the use of mobility as a conceptual framework for the analysis of migration, the paper calls for stronger attention to the spatial dimension of human life in sociological theory altogether, rather than confining ‘mobility’ to a specific research field and, ultimately, treating it as yet another dependent variable to be accounted for.Download Free PDFView PDFReinventing political order?
