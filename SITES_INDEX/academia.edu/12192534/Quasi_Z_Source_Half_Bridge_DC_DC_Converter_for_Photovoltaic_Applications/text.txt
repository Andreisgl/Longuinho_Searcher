The topology could be envisioned as an alternative to the boost half-bridge DC-DC converter but the benefit of its symmetric structure reduces the threat of transformer saturation due to the dc flux. The proposed converter features the continuous input current and could be used either with one or two input voltage sources.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersElectrical, Control and Communication EngineeringComparative Analysis of Semiconductor Power Losses of Galvanically Isolated Quasi-Z-Source and Full-Bridge Boost DC-DC Converters2015 • Roman KosenkoDownload Free PDFView PDFIET Power ElectronicsGalvanically isolated high gain Y-source DC–DC converters for dispersed power generation2016 • Mojtaba ForouzeshDownload Free PDFView PDFScientific Journal of Riga  …Practical Design Guidelines of qZSI Based Step-Up DC/DC Converter2010 • Janis  ZakisDownload Free PDFView PDFAnalysis of operating modes of the novel isolated interface converter for PMSG based wind turbines2011 • Janis  ZakisThis paper presents a new converter topology for a permanent magnet synchronous generator based variable speed wind turbine. Main emphasis is on the combination of a controlled rectifier and a novel step-up isolated DC/DC converter topology proposed by the authors. The topology (controlled rectifier coupled with a quasi-Z-source based galvanically isolated step-up DC/DC converter) is essential to generate regulated DC voltage (400 V DC typical for 230 V AC output) despite wide variations in the output voltage of a wind generator. The operation principle of the proposed topology is described in detail. Experimental results are presented and analyzed.Download Free PDFView PDFPower Electronics and Motion  …New bi-directional DC/DC converter for supercapacitor interfacing in high-power applications2010 • Janis  ZakisThis paper presents a new bi-directional DC/DC converter for supercapacitor interfacing in high-power applications. The converter acts as a VSI-based step-down DC/DC converter during the supercapacitor charging mode and as a qZSI-based step-up DC/DC converter during the energy recovery mode. To provide voltage matching and galvanic isolation the medium frequency transformer was implemented. To ensure higher voltage boost of the SC voltage during the discharge the qZSI with a two-stage quasi-Z-source (qZS) network was introduced. The paper analyzes and discusses the operation of the new converter mostly concentrating on the energy recovery (boost) mode. The operation of the two-stage qZS-network is analyzed in detail. Guidelines are presented for the new converter design. Finally, theoretical background was verified by the simulations.Download Free PDFView PDF…  and Exposition (APEC),  …New high-gain step-up DC/DC converter with high-frequency isolation2012 • Janis  ZakisDownload Free PDFView PDFIEEE Transactions on Industrial ElectronicsQuasi-Z-Source Based Isolated DC/DC Converters for Distributed Power Generation2010 • Dmitri VinnikovDownload Free PDFView PDF…  Drives Automation and  …Experimental study of shoot-through control methods for qZSI-based DC/DC converters2010 • Janis  ZakisThis paper proposes a novel step-up DC/DC converter with galvanic isolation - the quasi-Z-source inverter (qZSI) based DC/DC converter and discusses three different shoot-through PWM control methods suitable for this topology. The proposed converter is meant for applications where the wide range of voltage gain is demanded, e.g. with renewable energy sources (fuel cells, photovoltaic cells), in telecom, aerospace and some other applications. For the verification of theoretical assumptions the converter prototype was assembled and tested. Experimental waveforms of the converter operated with different shoot-through PWM control methods are compared and discussed. Design considerations for converter and different control signal generators are provided.Download Free PDFView PDFA Review on Voltage Boosting Techniques for Step-Up DC-DC ConvertersMojtaba ForouzeshStep-up dc-dc converters are used to boost the voltage level of the input to a higher output level. Despite of its features such as simplicity of implementation, the fundamental boost dc-dc converter has shortcomings such as low boost ability and low power density. With these limitations, researches on new voltage boosting techniques are inevitable for various power converter applications. This can be achieved either by additional magnetic or by electric field storage elements with switching elements (switch and/or diode) in different configurations. Such combination of primary voltage boosting techniques and topologies are large, which at times may be confusing and difficult to follow/adapt for different applications. Considering these aspects and in order to make a clear sketch of the general law and framework of various voltage boosting techniques, this paper comprehensively reviews different voltage boosting techniques and categorizes them according to their circuit performance. Keywords— High step-up dc-dc converter; high voltage gain; interleaved; magnetically coupled inductor; multi-level; multi-stage; switched capacitor; switched inductor; voltage multiplier.Download Free PDFView PDFIEEE Transactions on Power ElectronicsStep-Up DC–DC Converters: A Comprehensive Review of Voltage Boosting Techniques, Topologies, and Applications2017 • Mojtaba ForouzeshAbstract—DC–DC converters with voltage boost capability are widely used in a large number of power conversion applications, from fraction-of-volt to tens of thousands of volts at power levels from milliwatts (mW) to megawatts (MW). The literature has reported on various voltage boosting techniques in which fundamental energy storing elements (inductors and capacitors) and/or transformers in conjunction with switch(es) and diode(s) are utilized in the circuit. These techniques include switched capacitor (charge pump), voltage multiplier, switched inductor/voltage lift, magnetic coupling and multi-stage/-level, and each has its own merits and demerits depending on application, in terms of cost, complexity, power density, reliability, and efficiency. To meet the growing demand for such applications, new power converter topologies that use the above voltage boosting techniques, as well as some active and passive components, are continuously being proposed. The permutations and combinations of the various voltage boosting techniques with additional components in a circuit allow for numerous new topologies and configurations, which are often confusing and difficult to follow. Therefore, to present a clear picture on the general law and framework of the development of next generation step-up dc–dc converters, this paper aims to comprehensively review and classify various step-up dc–dc converters based on their characteristics and voltage boosting techniques. In addition, the advantages and disadvantages of these voltage boosting techniques and associated converters are discussed in detail. Finally, broad applications of dc–dc converters are presented and summarized with comparative study of different voltage boosting techniques. Index Terms—Switched mode step-up dc–dc converter, PWM boost converter, voltage multiplier, voltage lift, switched capacitor, switched inductor, coupled inductors, transformer, multistage converter, multilevel converter.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
