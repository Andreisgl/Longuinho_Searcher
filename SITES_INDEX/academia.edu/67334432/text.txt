Among scholars and media experts, development journalism is essential in tackling development issues that affect the different facets of life. The thrust of this paper explores the effective use of development journalism as a means of promoting breast cancer care in Africa. In addition, it also examines the principle of development communication in promoting sustainable health development. Against the backdrop of agenda setting theory and development media theory, which moves that media should focus on the audience needs, the paper draws attention to the various pathways in promoting breast cancer care among women in African countries. In conclusion, it was advocated that there was dire need for development journalism to serve as a health communication to promote breast cancer care among women in Africa and the wider world.
