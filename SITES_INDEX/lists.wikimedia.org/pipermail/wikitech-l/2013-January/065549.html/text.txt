Well, the account creation API is still pending. If I'm lucky it'll be
merged by the 1.21 release. :P I also have a change pending that redoes the
password recovery system so that it uses tokens rather than temporary
passwords.
Other than that, I'm still working on a centralized
authentication/authorization system, but I don't think it'll be ready for
this release (hopefully it can get in the next release alongside the
password hashing rewrite).

 In that vein, what changes or features have you been working on?  I'll
 spend some time looking over the commit messages, but often those don't
 give the sort of "big picture" that end users of MW could benefit from.
 If you would rather update https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki_1.21
 yourself, feel free.  Otherwise, I'll try to update that page with user
 visible changes and improvements that third party users of MW could
 benefit from.
 In a side note: I'm not very good with visual presentation.  If anyone
 wants to take on that bit of the release notes, watch the page and chime
 in where you think you can help.
 Mark.
