Both of the previously healthy children tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections. Clinical presentations were similar in both with fever, gastrointestinal complaints, respiratory distress, rash, headache and myalgia. Laboratory values were high levels of C-reactive protein, D-dimers, B-type natriuretic peptide (Pro-BNP), troponin I and low albumin levels in both patients. Evaluations for other infectious diseases werenegative. Both the patients were critically ill, requiring admission to the pediatric intensive care unit (P-ICU) due to circulatory shock and needed inotropes. One of the patients had respiratory failure and required mechanical ventilation. Both patients received steroids, I...See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersCo-infection with Dengue and COVID-19: A Case Report of Multiorgan Dysfunction in a Child2021 • Manifa AfrinConcomitant severe dengue with COVID-19 can be difficult to diagnose as both diseases have similar symptoms and laboratory findings. Bangladesh is currently facing a double burden of severe dengue and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Co-infection with these viruses can result in severe morbidity. Worldwide this co-infection is rare. However, we present a complicated case of severe dengue with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The child presented with multiorgan dysfunction with plasma leakage and positive for dengue nonstructural protein 1 antigen and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2. Echocardiographic evaluation showed coronary arterial abnormalities. Patient was successfully managed according to dengue syndrome guidelines and received intravenous immunoglobulin with methyl prednisolone, aspirin for coronary arterial involvements. Through this case report, we aim to describe the severity of co-infection of dengue and SARSCoV-2 in a child in a dengue endemic region d...Download Free PDFView PDFDhaka Shishu (Children) Hospital JournalClinical Presentation and Outcome of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children in Dhaka Shishu (Children) Hospital2021 • abu hasnatBackground: The increasing trend in multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) during Covid-19 pandemic is alarming. Understanding the clinical course and outcome will give the clinical and public health implications of this syndrome. Objectives: This study was conducted to find out the clinical presentation, course of the disease and outcome of the children and adolescents of MIS-C. Methods: This observational study was conducted in the department of Pediatric Nephrology, Dhaka Shishu (Children) Hospital, Dhaka, Bangladesh, from August 2020 to October 2020. Total 12 children of MIS-C diagnosed according to WHO diagnostic criteria of MIS-C were included after taking written informed consent from the parents. Mean, median and standard deviation were calculated for the continuous variables. Results: The age ranged from 17 days to 13 years, 56% were male, 17% were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR and 4(33%) had history of the COVID-19 exposure.

The aim is to describe cardiovascular involvement, management and early outcome in MIS-C by comparing cardiovascular manifestations in children younger and older than 6 years old. This retrospective observational study included 25 children with MIS-C, admitted to a single pediatric center between March 2020 and September 2021. The median age was 5 years (13 patients under 6 years and 12 over 6 years); coronary artery abnormalities were observed in 77% of preschoolers, with small and medium aneurysms in half of the cases and two cases of mild ventricular dysfunction. School-age children presented myopericardial involvement with mild to moderate ventricular dysfunction in 67% of cases, and two cases of transient coronary dilatation. There was a significant NT-pro-BNP and inflammatory markers increase in 25 of the patie...Download Free PDFView PDFReumatismoChildren with Kawasaki disease or Kawasaki-like syndrome (MIS-C/PIMS) at the time of COVID-19: are they all the same? Case series and literature reviewAchille MarinoSince the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak started, children have been considered marginally involved compared to adults, with a quite significant percentage of asymptomatic carriers. Very recently, an overwhelming inflammatory activation, which shares clinical similarities with Kawasaki disease (KD), has been described in children exposed to COVID-19. We report three KD-like cases that occurred during the pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in a highly affected area of Northern Italy. The clinical presentation was characterized by the presence of unremitting fever, diarrhea and elevated inflammatory markers. Case #1 and Case #2 occurred one week apart and shared other clinical features: laboratory tests confirmed COVID-19 exposure and high inflammatory activation with myocardial involvement. Case #3 followed a more typical pattern for KD. Interestingly, this patient showed lower levels of procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, D-dimers, ...Download Free PDFView PDFPediatric CardiologyPaediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome: Temporally Associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS): Cardiac Features, Management and Short-Term Outcomes at a UK Tertiary Paediatric HospitalAshish  ChikermaneDownload Free PDFView PDFPediatria PolskaApproach to a child with Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome associated with COVID19.
