After a brief introduction to the participatory approach, I limit my discussion to the following four key issues: a. the participatory critique of Wilber’s work, b. the cultural versus universal nature of Wilber’s Kosmic habits, c. the question of (post-)metaphysics in spiritual discourse, and d. the nature of enlightenment. The article concludes with some concrete directions in which to move the dialogue forward.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

An embodied spiritual inquiry into the nature of human boundaries: Outcomes of a participatory approach to transpersonal education and researchThe International Journal of Transpersonal Studies,  2022Embodied spiritual inquiry (ESI) is a radical approach to integral and transpersonal education an... more Embodied spiritual inquiry (ESI) is a radical approach to integral and transpersonal education and research offered as a graduate course at the California Institute of Integral Studies (CIIS). Inspired by elements of participatory research and cooperative inquiry, ESI applies interactive embodied meditations to access multiple ways of knowing (e.g., somatic, vital, emotional, mental, contemplative) and mindfully inquire into collaboratively decided questions. This article presents the learning outcomes of an inquiry into the nature of human boundaries within and between co-inquirers, providing an example of how ESI is implemented in the classroom and can be used to study transpersonal subject matter. In particular, the study found that boundaries were experienced in terms of their dynamic effects rather than as static qualities, with a relationship between dissociation and overly firm boundaries, as well as a relationship between integration/merging and more varied combinations of f...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In particular, analysis focuses on Friedman&#39;s (2002, 2013a) proposed division of labor between a &#39;&#39;scientific&#39;&#39; transpersonal psychology and &#39;&#39;nonscientific&#39;&#39; transpersonal studies. This paper demonstrates that despite Friedman&#39;s aim to detach transpersonal psychology from any particular metaphysical worldview, turning the field into a modern scientific discipline effectively binds transpersonal psychology to a naturalistic metaphysical worldview that is hostile to most spiritual knowledge claims. After identifying several problems with Friedman&#39;s account of science and neo-Kantian skepticism about &#39;&#39;supernatural&#39;&#39; factors in spiritual events, this paper introduces the perspective of a participatory metaphysical pluralism and considers the challenge of shared spiritual visions for scientific...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Michael Murphy and Ken Wilber have each made excellent contributions in offering prescriptions for &#39;&#39;Integral Transformative Practice&#39;&#39; (ITP) which include various physical and psychospiritual disciplines. Their prescriptions, however, can easily perpetuate the mind-centered direction of growth characteristic of the modern West in that they inherently ask one&#39;s mind to pick and commit to already constructed practices. Needed is an approach that will permit all human dimensions to co-creatively participate in the unfolding of integral growth. As one possible solution, the author presents a program of ITP developed by Albareda and Romero in Spain. Their Holistic Integration is based in group retreats to practice &#39;&#39;interactive embodied meditations,&#39;&#39; which involve co...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Following an introduction to participatory spirituality, the paper discusses three ways this approach has been understood in the transpersonal literature: as disciplinary model, theoretical orientation, and paradigm or paradigmatic epoch. It then reviews the influence of the participatory turn in transpersonal studies, consciousness studies, integral education, and religious studies. After responding to Wilberian-integral, astro-archetypal, and participatory critiques, the article concludes with reflections about the nature and future of the participatory movement. My contribution to the participatory turn in transpersonal studies was formalized in 2002, when Revisioning Transpersonal Theory (Revisioning) was published shortly after Tarnas&#39;s (2001) preview of the book in the pages of this journal....Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

LOVE AND FREEDOM: TRANSCENDING MONOGAMY AND POLYAMORYRowman & Littlefield,  2021In Love and Freedom, Jorge Ferrer proposes a paradigm shift in how romantic relationships are con... more In Love and Freedom, Jorge Ferrer proposes a paradigm shift in how romantic relationships are conceptualized, a step forward in the evolution of modern relationships. In the same way that the transgender movement surmounted the gender binary, Ferrer defines how a parallel step can—and should—be taken with the relational style binary. This book offers the first systematic discussion of relationship modes beyond monogamy and polyamory, as well as introduces the notion of “relational freedom” as the capability to choose one’s relational style free from biological, psychological, and sociocultural conditionings.To achieve these goals, Ferrer first discusses a number of critical categories—specifically, monopride/polyphobia, and polypride/monophobia—that mediate the contemporary “mono–poly wars,” that is, the predicament of mutual competition among monogamists and polyamorists. The ideological nature of these “mono–poly wars” is demonstrated through a review of available empirical literature on the psychological health and relationship quality of monogamous and polyamorous individuals and couples. Then, after showing how monogamy and polyamory ultimately reinforce each other, Ferrer articulates three relational pathways to living in-between, through, and beyond the mono/poly binary: fluidity, hybridity, and transcendence. Moving beyond that binary opens a fuzzy, liminal, and multivocal relational space that Ferrer calls novogamy.In this groundbreaking book, readers will learn practical tools to not only transform jealousy, but also enhance their relational freedom while being aware of key issues of diversity and social justice. They will also learn novel criteria to evaluate the success of their intimate relationships, and be introduced to a transformed vision of romantic love beyond both monocentrism and emerging polynormativities.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
