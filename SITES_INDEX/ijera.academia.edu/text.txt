A medical device that can actively assist in neck rehabilitation training is crucial to overcome the limitations of conventional neck braces, which have a single supporting point and cannot achieve active rehabilitation. Taking into account the human body mechanism and the basic movement of the head, a 2-UPU spatial parallel-series hybrid mechanism with a single R series-parallel mechanism is proposed to effectively assist in neck rehabilitation training. The mechanism introduces a spherical gear to improve transmission accuracy and uses intermittent transmission of two sets of unipolar gears and spherical gears to achieve two degrees of freedom of nodding and shaking of the head without interference. A pair of ordinary gears are used to accomplish the rotation degree of freedom efficiently and achieve the three basic movements of the human head. The designed exoskeleton-like robot mechanism has multifunctionality and includes a cam mechanism for massaging the posterior neck acupoint, which further enhances the rehabilitation effect. A stepper motor control system is designed to achieve the assisted rehabilitation movement of the exoskeleton device.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

An essential goal of coal-fired power plants is to achieve nearly efficient combustion while emitting as few harmful gases as possible. This work presents an in-depth review of coal combustion characteristics and emissions. An in-depth analysis of the impact of ash content, moisture content, particle size, and oxygen concentration on coal's ignition and emission characteristics and its blend with different types of coal and biomass is presented. In this review, experimental as well as numerical aspects are discussed. Co-combustion of coal and biomass under oxyfuel conditions holds the potential for negative carbon-dioxide emissions into the environment. This is an effective technology for reducing CO2 levels in the atmosphere as well as NOx and SO2 emissions.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

We understand large-scale systems as multiply connected systems. These include economic, social, ecological, linguistic and other systems, the behavior (functioning) of which is associated with decision-making. The stability of the state and disturbance in such systems depends not only on external factors, but also on the decisions made by the system itself. It is difficult to obtain adequate formal models for these systems. The paper gives a generalization of two approaches based on the presentation of the initial data in the form of fuzzy gradations proposed by the author: the matrix method and method of expansion in series. The method based on fuzzy matrices is used to analyze the propagation of disturbances in the system. It allows us to perform a qualitative analysis of changes in the stability and adaptability of the system depending on the level of disturbances. The method based on the representation of the function of the system's behavior in the form of a series is used to determine the area of stability of the system depending on the influence of external factors. These approaches allow us to understand how small changes in the system lead to abrupt changes and instability. Calculations are performed for various cases of external factors and control parameters. Keywords and phrases: fuzzy arithmetic, large-scale systems, stability of systems, matrix method, series expansion method.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The majority of the scientific research on the potentially harmful health consequences of chemicals in that industry relates to human exposure during the production of textiles. However, there is substantially less information available regarding consumer exposure. In this paper, we have evaluated the most recent scientific data on human exposure to chemicals from skin-contacting clothing. The review has mostly concentrated on the correlation between early life exposure to formaldehyde and determining the probability of contracting cancer. A non-negligible presence of some chemicals in some textiles, which could pose a risk to the system, indicates human cutaneous exposure to potentially harmful substances through skin-contact textiles/clothes.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The aggressive promotion of electric vehicle chargers will negatively impact the power quality of the power system because they are a usual high power nonlinear device. Electric car chargers use power electronic technology. Therefore, this is a significant issue that must be taken into account when building a recharge station. Before building an electric car charging station, engineers must assess and model the effect the station and its functioning will have on the grid. Engineers must also be aware of whether national standards are met in terms of charging station building requirements. In order to determine whether suitable administration, such as harmonic suppression and reactive power correction devices, need to be configured at charging stations, the findings of analysis and models can serve as a reference during the building of charging stations. The article's primary focus is on the PV array, charger, and charging station elements of a modelling study of a photovoltaic electric car charging station. Then it describes how to model and analyse data using MATLAB modelling software.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The goal is to provide a tool that farmers may use to ease some of the basic difficulties associated with farming. Farmers regularly grow the same crops, and instead of using the proper quality and quantity of pesticides and fertilizers, they use random pesticides and fertilizers, which reduce crop production and cause soil pollution and acidification. A web application utilizing machine learning methods is created to address these problems and it will benefit farmers in a variety of ways. This web application will suggest the best crop for a certain plot of land based on the content, weather conditions, and time of year. Early diagnosis of plant diseases is the answer to halting the losses in agricultural product productivity and quantity. Examining distinctly observable patterns on plant leaves is part of the research on plant diseases. In order to detect plant illnesses in a sustainable way, image processing is used rather than directly examining the plants themselves.The system will focus on finding solutions to issues, significant yield and quality constraints like plant diseases that result in enormous economic losses, farmers' ignorance of crop yield maximization and crop rotation techniques, etc.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

However, the unrestricted nature of the internet has also brought about a host of challenges, including the dissemination of inappropriate or harmful content. In response to these challenges, various methods of image and website content control have been developed. ImgInspect is software that automatically detects and censors the content of a web page using AI and machine learning. As we all know, there is a great quantity of information and content on the internet, much of which consists of pornographic and violent photos and movies. How to reliably determine the bare picture is a crisis that needs to be answered right now because the distribution of nude photographs on the Internet contributed to a lot of social issues. Furthermore, the current state of affairs makes it simple for even a young child to obtain these contents. The programme that ImgInspect wants to offer can be installed on a computer and will automatically block certain contents and websites, protecting the online safety of young brains. An administrator has control over this function. Due to constraints, this project's scope will solely cover the censorship of violent imagery.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The material balance method does not analyze for future production performance of the reservoir with well types. To solve this problem, the dynamic material balance modelling technique is applied for production performance forecast using prediction profile subject to production schedules. This study applies the dynamic material balance modelling technique to forecast production in a typical limestone formation. The material balance modelling method was applied on a limestone reservoir, "W" field to determine the OOIP (Oil Originally in Place), presence and relative strength of an aquifer, relative driving mechanisms of the reservoir and simulate fluid production. The dynamic material balance modelling is performed to estimate the reserves and forecast future production from the reservoir. The Monte Carlo Analysis Tool is used to validate the OOIP obtained from the model using the 90 th , 50 th and 10 th percentile approach for economic analysis. "W" field was estimated to have an OOIP as 445.5 MMSTB with a predominant water drive having a moderate aquifer strength. 56.7% and 58.1% (+1.4%) of the reserve were recovered from primary drive and secondary drive (gas injection) at abandonment. It was predicted for the above cases, a recovery of 65.26% (15.1% of recovery factor at abandonment) with 3003 and 2961 psia at abandonment and end of predicted year respectively. The 50 th percent probability resulted in an OOIP of 468.58 MMSTB.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The marine diesel engine is defined by a set of non-linear differential equations, i.e. by a continuous simulation model of a higher order and the so-called equations of state. At the same time, the simulation model is discrete as it strictly satisfies the chosen value of the fundamental integration time step DT. The paper presents a mathematical model of the system consisting of a marine diesel engine model, which forms the basis for designing a system dynamic qualitative model (mental-verbal, structural and schematic model) and a quantitative model (system dynamic mathematical and information simulation model). A scenario of mixed propulsion states has been presented. Parameters obtained with the aid of the hardware simulator Kongsberg ERS-L11 MAN B&W-5L90MC-VLCC Version MC90-IV have been used in conducting the simulation.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

These guide trees are generated using a metric named Radial Distance. The guide trees produced by SARELI were fed into MUSCLE to proceed with the rest of the alignment procedure. The resulting alignments were compared against the results from MUSCLE (with its original guide trees), Clustal Omega, three variants of MAFFT, and T-Coffee on the BAliBASE 3, PREFAB 4.0, and SABRE protein sequence databases. The sum of pairs score, and the column score were used for scoring the results against the reference alignments of the three protein benchmark databases. SARELI can be used as a specialized tool for generating guide trees that in conjunction with MUSCLE can obtain significantly better multiple sequence alignment scores than the other MSA methods tested when the set to be aligned contains more than 35 protein sequences, and its average sequence length and p-distance are less than 239 and 0.81, respectively. As future work we would like to improve the performance of the SARELI algorithm.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In the first method, namely the position-finding method, the initial volume is reduced by cut-extrusion of some circular holes with a uniform volume gradient along the length of the sample. In this method, the position of each hole is manipulated by using a genetic algorithm (GA) to achieve the minimum von Mises stress versus a specific tensile load. In the second method, namely geometry optimization method, several circular holes with different diameters are cut-extruded with monotonically decreasing volume gradient along the length of the sample to create a volume fraction at the beginning of optimization. As an alternative approach to the first method, an algorithm is seeded to alter the diameters of holes on the sample to minimize the same objective function i.e., von Mises stress. In the third method, namely integrated position and geometry optimization approach, several square holes are cut-extruded along the length of the sample with a uniform volume gradient. Then, by using a GA, the position of each square along the width of the sample is manipulated together with their dimensions to minimize the same objective function of former methods versus the same applied load. Finally, the structural results of each sample in addition to the generated support structures, as one of the basic elements of some additive manufacturing (AM) processes, are compared with the software-based topologically-optimized sample with equivalent volume fraction.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Sudden changes in the geometry of structures give rise to stress values that are higher than those obtained by elementary equations of solid mechanics. Therefore the evaluation of stress state at such locations needs specialized techniques such as Finite Element Method (FEM).The finite element method is a numerical procedure that can be used to obtain solution to a large variety of engineering problems such as structural, thermal, heat transfer, electromagnetism and fluid flow. In the present investigation, focus has been kept on the finite element modeling and determination of stress concentration factor (SCF) in linearly elastic structures with different stress-raisers such as circular and elliptical holes and double semicircular notch at different locations in a finite plate. The results obtained from FEM are compared with those obtained by analytical relations as given in literature. A commercially available finite element solver ANSYS has been used for the modeling and analysis in the investigation. Throughout the investigation, plane82, which is an eight node two-dimensional element is used for the discretization.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
