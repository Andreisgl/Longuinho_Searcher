Hello!
I would like to announce the release of MediaWiki 1.29.1. There was an
issue wherein two extensions (SpamBlacklist and PdfHandler) were missing
from the generated packages.
Considering the report wasn't very widespread, most users uploaded the
existing files over the old one (per the upgrade instructions) so they
didn't actually lose their extensions.
Apologies for any issues you may have encountered during your upgrade. The
updated links can be found below:
