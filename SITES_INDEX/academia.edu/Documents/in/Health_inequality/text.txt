The authors examined associations of parental social class at age 0-16 years with mortality among 1,824,064 Swedes born in 1944-1960. Females and males from manual compared with nonmanual childhood social classes were more likely to die from smoking-related cancers, stomach cancer, respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Males from manual compared with nonmanual social classes were more likely to die from unintentional injury, homicide, and alcoholic cirrhosis. The association with stomach cancer was little affected by adjustment for parental later-life and own adult social class or education. For other outcomes, educational attainment resulted in greater attenuation of associations than did adjustment for adult social class.

Effects range from more intense and frequent cyclones, flooding, and heat waves through to changing infectious disease patterns, food and water insecurity, sea-level rise, and economic and social disruption. The governments of almost all developed nations are now focusing their attention on national policy responses to the threat of climate change. In New Zealand, it is currently unclear what path our current government will take to contribute to the global response and fulfil our Kyoto obligations. In this paper we discuss the main carbon pricing options currently under consideration, and their implications for health and health inequities in New Zealand. We summarise the literature about the likely health and equity implications of different kinds of carbon pricing policy.

The aims of this comparative study of two different welfare states are first, to compare whether the relationship between social class and health is similar among young men and women at different age groups in these two welfare states; second, to examine at what age social class differences in self-reported health and illness among young adults emerge in these two countries; and third, to find out whether class of origin (i.e. parental social class) or class of destination (i.e. individual&amp;#39;s achieved social class) have greater explanatory power in studies of health among young adults. We used comparable nationally representative interview surveys from Britain and Finland. The British data is derived from the General Household Survey for 1988 and 1989, and the Finnish data from the 1986 Level of Living Survey. We analysed five year age groups between 16 and 39 years in Britain (N = 16,626) and 15 and 39 years in Finland (N = 5950). Two health indicators (limiting long-standing illness and self-assessed health), and several indicators for social class were compared. The best discriminator of differences in ill-health among young adults both in Finland and Britain was education. Social class differences by own occupation (achieved class) emerged soon after the age of 20 among men and women in both countries and strengthened with increasing age. There was a weaker but consistent association with class of origin in both countries. Housing tenure is strongly associated with young adults&amp;#39; health in Britain but not Finland.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)Save to LibraryDownloadby Sara Arber•  24  Sociology, Anthropology, Welfare State, Health inequalityUsing Geodemographics to Illustrate Health InequalitiesSave to LibraryDownloadby Tom Hennell•Health inequalityAgency versus structure or nature versus nurture: When the new twist on an old debate is not that new after all: A commentary on AngelSave to LibraryDownloadby Twisted Angel•  8  Genetics, Sociology, Anthropology, Health inequalityAgency versus structure or nature versus nurture: When the new twist on an old debate is not that new after allSave to LibraryDownloadby Marianna Fotaki•  8  Genetics, Sociology, Anthropology, Health inequalityThe health of nations in a global context: Trade, global stratification, and infant mortality ratesSave to LibraryDownloadby Ana Teixeira•  20  Economics, Anthropology, Epidemiology, GlobalizationCraveiro, D.

This correlation has been documented in a large body of literature that reflects a clear incongruity between empirical reality and the values of justice and social cohesion. Health status results from the mutual interaction of multiple factors that act in different ways over the life of the individual. A study of social inequalities in health that centres on a specific phase of people's lives, such as old age, may contribute to a better understanding of the factors and mechanisms that define health, and help to generate a relevant framework for the development of social policies.Save to LibraryDownloadby Daniela Craveiro•  3  Health inequality, Health Inequalities, Sociology of AgingTackling Health Inequalities in the United Kingdom: The Progress and Pitfalls of PolicySave to LibraryDownloadby Mark  Exworthy•  10  Health inequality, Health Policy, United Kingdom, Policy makingHow can evidence-based practice contribute to reducing health inequalities in NSW?Save to LibraryDownloadby Stephen Leeder•  14  Nursing, Evidence Based Medicine, Evidence Based Practice, Health inequalityEl abordaje epidemiol�gico de las desigualdades en salud a nivel localSave to LibraryDownloadby Hugo Spinelli  Spinelli•  2  Health inequality, Health CareMasculinity and the Body: How African American and White Men Experience Cancer Screening Exams Involving the RectumPast research on prostate and colorectal cancer disparities finds that barriers to screening, such as embarrassment and offensiveness, are often reported.

Yet none of this literature investigates why. This study uses masculinity and health theory to examine how men experience two common screenings: digital rectal exams (DREs) and colonoscopies. In-depth interviews were conducted with 64 African American and White men from diverse backgrounds, aged 40 to 64, from North Carolina. Regardless of race or education, men experienced DREs more negatively than colonoscopies because penetration with a finger was associated with a gay sexual act. Some men disliked colonoscopies, however, because they associated any penetration as an affront to their masculinity. Because beliefs did not differ by race, future research should focus on structural issues to examine why disparities persist with prostate and colorectal cancer.

A number of researchers and policy makers have argued that early interventions aimed at supporting the family is the most effective way of tackling child behaviour problems. This study forms the economic component of a randomised evaluation of the Incredible Years programme, a programme aimed at improving the skills and parenting strategies of parents of children with conduct problems. Our results show that the programme provides a cost-effective way of reducing behavioural problems. Furthermore, our cost analysis, when combined with a consideration of the potential long-run benefits, suggests that investment in such programmes may generate favourable long-run economic returns.Save to LibraryDownloadby Professor Sinead  McGilloway•  22  Early Intervention, Health inequality, Parenting, Applied EconomicsEpidemiología de las desigualdades del desarrollo de género en España (1990-2000)Save to LibraryDownloadby María Teresa Ruiz  Cantero and +2Mercedes CarrascoJordi Torubiano-domínguez•  9  Health inequality, Public Health Policy, Human Development, Public HealthTuberculosis and urban growth: Class, race and disease in early Phoenix, Arizona, USASave to LibraryDownloadby Bob Bolin•  15  Discourse Analysis, Human Geography, Health inequality, PoliticsTransport and social exclusion: a G7 comparison studySave to LibraryDownloadby Karen Lucas•  5  Health inequality, Quality of life, Social Exclusion, Transportation PlanningThe role of the school nurse in special schools for pupils with severe learning difficultiesThe work of two paediatric nurses working full-time in special schools was monitored over a full school year.

We argue that economic theory can help in identifying mechanisms through which specific socioeconomic indicators and health interact. Our reading of the literature, and our own work, leads us to conclude that non-degenerate versions of the Grossman model (1972a;b) and its extensions can explain many salient stylized facts on health inequalities. Yet, further development is required in at least two directions. First, a childhood phase needs to be incorporated, in recognition of the importance of childhood endowments and investments in the determination of later-life socioeconomic and health outcomes. Second, a unified theory of joint investment in skill (or human) capital and in health capital could provide a basis for a theory of the relationship between education and health.Save to LibraryDownloadby Titus Galama•  5  Health inequality, Health Disparities, Health, InequalityGeographical accessibility and Kentucky's heart-related hospital servicesSave to LibraryDownloadby Holly  Barcus•  12  Human Geography, Spatial Analysis, Accessibility, Health inequalityThe UNESCO Highland Peoples Surveys: Tracing Inequalities in Health Care Access and Provision in Northern ThailandThailand's public health system is lauded globally for its broad access and coverage.

However, significant gaps in health outcomes persist for diverse highland Indigenous and ethnic minority communities that have historically resided along the country's northern and northwestern border region. Yet, Thailand's census data do not tabulate ethnicity, and therefore preclude assessments of health barriers and progress among ethnic minority groups anywhere in the country. Moreover, state surveys of highlanders, often undertaken for surveillance purposes in the mid-to-late 20th century, never included measures of health, educational attainment, wealth, or other indices of inequality. Beginning in 2005, UNESCO undertook a sequential, mixedmethodological research program in the highlands to assess progress and barriers in citizenship acquisition and inequalities related thereto. In the Highland Peoples Survey (HPS) I, more than 60,000 people in nearly 200 villages in 3 provinces were surveyed, and in the HPS II, more than 70,000 people representing 18 ethnic groups in over 300 villages in 5 provinces were surveyed. In addition to providing a detailed overview of the unique utility of the UNESCO Highland Peoples Surveys for ascertaining complex dynamics of ethnicity, legal status, wealth, and health care availability for highlanders, this article presents a broad exploration of health access detected in the 2010 survey, and thus provides a baseline of health inequalities among highlanders from which future comparative analyses may be drawn.Save to LibraryDownloadby Daniel B Ahlquist and +1David Feingold•  9  Health inequality, Health Care Service Access and Utilization, Thailand, Public HealthNeoliberal reforms in health systems and the construction of long-lasting inequalities in health care: A case study from ChileThe aim of this article is to discuss how neoliberal policies implemented in the Chilean health system during the Pinochet regime have a lingering effect on equal access to health care today.

The two-tier health system – public and private – that was introduced in the early 1980s as a means to improve efficiency and lower health-related costs, has led instead to inequality of access and dehumanisation of health care. Health has changed from being a right to being a marketable need, thus creating a structural disadvantage for several parts of the population – particularly the poor, the elderly, and women – who cannot afford the better-quality services and timely attention of private health providers, and thus, are not adequately protected against health risks. Despite the recent health reforms that aim at improving equity in health care access and financing, we argue that the Chilean health system is still biased against the poorer segments of the population, while it favours the more affluent groups that can afford private health care.Save to LibraryDownloadby Elena Rotarou•  5  Health inequality, Neoliberalism, Chile, Health PolicyEvidence-Based Public Health Policy and Practice: Promises and LimitsSave to LibraryDownloadby Lloyd Novick•  12  Human Geography, Primary Care, Education, EpidemiologyGender and health inequities: A comment on the Final Report of the WHO Commission on the Social Determinants of HealthSave to LibraryDownloadby Kristen Springer•  16  Sociology, Anthropology, Health inequality, Global HealthResearching health inequalities in adolescents: The development of the Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children (HBSC) Family Affluence ScaleSave to LibraryDownloadby Michal Molcho•  43  Sociology, Anthropology, Health Behavior, Research MethodologyEffectiveness of strategies for informing, educating, and involving patientsSave to LibraryDownloadby Angela Coulter•  14  Decision Making, Health inequality, Health Literacy, Self CareEmbodied health movements: new approaches to social movements in healthSave to LibraryDownloadby Stephen Zavestoski and +1Rebecca Altman•  26  Sociology, Medical Sociology, Social Change, Social MovementsIntellectual disability across culturesSave to LibraryDownloadby laura allison•  14  Psychiatry, Mental Health, Health inequality, CultureHarm reduction through a social justice lensSave to LibraryDownloadby Bernie Pauly•  4  Health inequality, Drug Policy, Psychology and Cognitive Sciences, Medical and Health SciencesRethinking the health consequences of social class and social mobilityThe task of studying the impact of social class on physical and mental health involves, among other things, the use of a conceptual toolbox that defines what social class is, establishes how to measure it, and sets criteria that help... moreThe task of studying the impact of social class on physical and mental health involves, among other things, the use of a conceptual toolbox that defines what social class is, establishes how to measure it, and sets criteria that help distinguish it from closely related concepts. One field that has recently witnessed a wealth of theoretical and conceptual research on social class is psychology, but geographers' and sociologists' attitude of diffidence toward this " positivistic " discipline has prevented them from taking advantage of this body of scholarship. This paper aims to highlight some of the most important developments in the psychological study of social class and social mobility that speak to the long-standing concerns of health geographers and sociologists with how social position, perceptions, social comparisons, and class-based identities impact health and well-being.DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.11.037Save to LibraryDownloadby Dragos Simandan•  392  Critical Theory, Sociology, Cultural Studies, Medical SociologySocial Inequality in BangladeshSave to LibraryDownloadby Md.

L’auteure s’est livrée à une observation participante directe du quotidien des ambulanciers privés français dont le travail reste un angle mort des travaux sociologiques consacrés aux métiers de la santé. Au-delà des représentations sociales dominantes de l’ambulancier « transporteur », l’enquête révèle les multiples tâches de soins qu’il réalise et notamment, les soins techniques pratiqués dans le cadre de transports sanitaires d’urgence. En 2007, la création du diplôme d’État d’ambulancier, qui prévoit un élargissement de leur mandat sanitaire dans ce domaine, marque un tournant dans l’histoire de ce groupe professionnel. Il constitue une opportunité de satisfaire les revendications d’un segment du groupe qui cherche à conquérir le statut de spécialiste de l’urgence en s’appuyant sur l’exemple des ambulanciers paramedics européens et américains. Toutefois, en dépit de facteurs technologiques et scientifiques favorables, l’aboutissement de ce processus de segmentation reste aujourd’hui incertain au regard des obstacles internes au groupe professionnel, mais aussi des freins politiques et corporatistes qu’il rencontre.Save to LibraryDownloadby Sylvie Morel-Sociologue Santé•  9  Sociology, Sociology of Work, Health inequality, Sociology of ProfessionsThe role of health in integrationSave to LibraryDownloadby Meghann Ormond and +4Claudia de FreitasPanos HatziprokopiouDavid InglebyMilena Chimienti•  11  Refugee Studies, Health inequality, HIV/AIDS, Social Determinants of HealthDismantling institutional racism: theory and actionSave to LibraryDownloadby Michael Yonas and +2Mondi MasonDerek Griffith•  20  Social Change, Psychology, Organizational Culture, Health inequalityAn investigation of the diets of infants born in Ireland during the first six months of lifeSave to LibraryDownloadby Roslyn Tarrant•  13  Health inequality, Public Health, Infant Mental Health, Disease PreventionHesaMag #03 : "Inégalités sociales de santé : l'impact du travail" (2011)L’état de santé des individus varie considérablement en fonction de la position qu’ils occupent dans la hiérarchie sociale.

Il s’agit d’uneévidence, observée de tout temps et entout lieu. Les quatre décennies qui ontsuivi la fin de la seconde guerre mondialeont bien permis de réduire dans les paysd’Europe occidentale les inégalités enmatière d’espérance de vie. Mais, depuisune vingtaine d’années, le fossé entreclasses nanties et classes populairess’élargit à nouveau. Dans un articlede synthèse, Laurent Vogel démontrel’impact des conditions de travail etdes nouveaux modes d’organisationdu travail sur ces inégalités de santé.Le directeur du département Santéet Sécurité de l’ETUI plaide pour unevéritable prise en considération deces facteurs par les pouvoirs publicsqui généralement les négligent auprofit exclusif de mesures de santépublique focalisées sur la prévention decomportements individuels (tabagisme,alcoolisme, alimentation) rendus seulsresponsables des inégalités de santé.La dimension de genre n’est guèredavantage prise en compte dans lespolitiques de santé publique. Pourtant,les schémas traditionnels de répartitiondes rôles au sein des couples tendentà totalement négliger l’impact dutravail domestique sur la santé desfemmes. Ici encore, la position socialeest déterminante : alors que le travailsalarié est un facteur de bonne santéet d’épanouissement pour les femmesdiplômées, il s’agit au contraire d’unesource de détérioration de la santé pourles femmes peu qualifiées.Dans les nouveaux États membresde l’Union européenne, les inégalitéssociales de santé ont considérablementaugmenté depuis leur conversion àl’économie de marché. Les statistiquesofficielles ont beau afficher une netteréduction des accidents du travail, uneenquête menée en Roumanie témoigneque la santé au travail reste la "dernièredes priorités" et que l’accès à des soinsde qualité est un privilège réservé à ceuxqui ont su s’adapter au nouveau modèleéconomique.Faudra-t-il pour réduire à nouveaules inégalités de santé revenir àune conception plus militante de lamédecine, à l’image d’expériencesdéveloppées au début des années 70 ?Certaines ont survécu à l’individualismedes années 80 et sont plus que jamaisutiles, comme l’illustre un reportagemené dans un service de médecine dutravail de la ville ouvrière de Sheffield.Une autre piste à explorer est celle d’unemeilleure information des médecinsgénéralistes quant à l’impact du travailsur la santé de leurs patients.

There are people who are parasitic and are incessantly feeding off and on the sweat of the 'povertised' of society. The chapter explores how poverty prevents the fulfilment and enjoyment of human rights and results in the deferral and postponement, abandonment and foregoing of the destination of people as happiness, freedom, self-and collective affirmation, and self-actualisation. It explains why poverty, as a form of fundamentalism, affects many Africans relative to other groups from different continents. Furthermore, it explores the ways in which what I call appropriates are complicit in the perpetuation of poverty and the fundamentalism associated with it. It also examines how the measurement of poverty speaks to the 'fundamentalisation' of poverty. This is evident in the manner in which poverty statistics are derived and interpreted to express the primacy of the exclusivity of the rich and a system of neoliberalism in which the 'trickle-down effect' – a hollow hypothesis-that should benefit the so-called poor has yet to materialise for inclusivity. The first part of this chapter discusses the povertisation of the masses through the processes of appropriation. The term 'povertised' is deliberately used to show that the povertisation of the masses is a deliberate outcome of a process of making people poor – a form of poverty production. Poverty is neither accidental nor inevitable. Povertisation gives this notion the elements of a process as opposed to being an event; it systematises poverty, and makes itSave to LibraryDownloadby Oliver  Mtapuri•  61  Sociology, Economic Sociology, Developmental Psychology, Development EconomicsHealth of Slovenian Youth: A Comparative Analysis of 2010 and 2013 National Youth Studies  [Zdravje mladih v Sloveniji: analiza empiričnih podatkov iz raziskav Mladina 2010 in Youth 2013]Introduction: Health and health-related behaviours in childhood, adolescence and youth are crucial for health and behavioural patterns in adulthood.

The purpose of this study was to examine the levels, distribution and socio-demographic determinants of health outcomes among Slovenian youth using three subjective health indicators.Methods: We used national survey samples of Slovenian youth from studies in 2010 and 2013 and analyzed three single-item indicators: self-rated health, self-reported chronic health problems (illness, disability, mental health problems) and perceived stress.Results: In 2013 16.8 % of respondents rated their health as excellent, 71.6 % as (very) good, and 11.5 % as poor/fair – the latter more often by women and respondents with less educated mothers. On average about every tenth respondent reported chronic health problems in six surveys covering the period 2002–2013. In 2013, 40.2 % of Slovenian youth experienced stress “at least weekly”, a slightly smaller proportion than in 2011 (41.1 %). The frequency of perceived stress was higher among women and older youth.Discussion and conclusions: In the 2010–2013 period there were no significant changes in subjective health status of Slovenian youth, despite the unfavourable macro-conditions in Slovenia and Europe, which had especially negative impact on the objective situation of young people (e.g., increases in the youth unemployment rates, etc.). Our study aimed to partially fill the research gap, since there is a lack of studies on health of Slovenian post-adolescent youth and young adults.Key words: self-rated health, perceived stress, chronic health problems, inequalities in health, determinants of health, youth. Izhodišča: Zdravje in z zdravjem povezana vedenja v obdobju otroštva, adolescence in mladosti so ključnega pomena za zdravje in vedenjske vzorce v odraslosti in poznejši starosti. Namen pričujoče raziskave je bil preučiti stopnje, distribucijo in sociodemografske dejavnike zdravstvenih izidov slovenske mladine na treh subjektivnih indikatorji zdravja.Metode: Uporabljeni so bili nacionalni anketni vzorci slovenske mladine iz let 2010 in 2013, analizirali pa smo indikatorje: samoocenjeno zdravje, samoporočane kronične zdravstvene težave (bolezen, invalidnost, psihične težave) in pogostost samozaznanega stresa.  Rezultati: V 2013 je 16,8 % respondentov svoje zdravje ocenilo kot odlično, 71,6 % kot (zelo) dobro, 11,5 % pa kot slabo/zadovoljivo – slednje pogosteje ženske in respondenti z manj izobraženimi materami. V povprečju približno vsaki desetih mladi v Sloveniji poroča kronične zdravstvene težave; v obdobju 2002–2013 je bil trend relativno stabilen. V letu 2013 je 40,2 % slovenske mladine doživljalo stres »vsaj tedensko«, nekoliko manjši delež kot v letu 2011 (41,1 %). Pogostost samozaznanega stresa je višja med ženskami in starejšo mladino.Diskusija in zaključki: V obdobju 2010–2013 ni prišlo do bistvenih sprememb subjektivnega zdravstvenega stanja slovenske mladine, kljub neugodnim makrorazmeram v Sloveniji in Evropi, ki še posebej slabo vplivajo na položaj mladih (npr. naraščanje stopnje brezposelnosti mladih). Z raziskavo smo poskušali deloma zapolniti raziskovalno vrzel, saj v Sloveniji primanjkuje raziskav o zdravju postadolescentne mladine in mladih na prehodu v odraslost.Ključne besede: samoocenjeno zdravje, samozaznan stres, kronične zdravstvene težave, neenakosti v zdravju, dejavniki zdravja, zdravje slovenske mladine.Save to LibraryDownloadby Andrej Kirbiš•  25  Health Psychology, Health Sciences, Health Promotion, Youth StudiesNextLast »Related TopicsMigration policiesFollowFollowingMigration and DevelopmentFollowFollowingHealth InequalitiesFollowFollowingSocial DemographyFollowFollowingSocail MediaFollowFollowingCritical Public HealthFollowFollowingResearch ProposalsFollowFollowingAccess to health servicesFollowFollowingSocial HealthFollowFollowingInternal migrationFollowFollowing 71.6 million researchers use this site every month.
