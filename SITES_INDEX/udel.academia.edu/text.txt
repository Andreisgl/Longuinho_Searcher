Review of Muqtedar Khan's Islam and Good Governance: A Political Philosophy of IhsanMarmara University,  2021M. A. Muqtedar Khan, who is widely known for his earlier edited work Islamic Democratic Discourse... more M. A. Muqtedar Khan, who is widely known for his earlier edited work Islamic Democratic Discourse and his article What is Enlightenment? An Islamic Perspective, presents this time a monograph which is focused on a single task. The argument of the book is carefully structured to invite the reader to reflect upon a long-lasting problem. Moreover, it not only analyzes the problem thoroughly but also offers a solution to it by doing justice to both historical and conceptual aspects of the problem. The author intends to propose an alternative paradigm for Muslims in overcoming their ongoing troubles regarding international security, conflict resolution, foreign policy, interfaith relations and social reform and development, and nation-building. Khan argues that instead of focusing on a structural level by demanding a Shariah-based state, Muslims can find ways to deal with social and political issues by invoking the principle of Ihsan, which has been traditionally understood as having a personal rather than communal connotation. Khan seeks to apply Ihsan in a communal setting to show that it promises a way out of a split worldview which consists in "two worlds, the real one where they have to deal with the world of nation-states and existing laws and then the imaginary one wherein they talk about Islamic identity, the Muslim world and Islamic things that exist as ideals or existed in an idealized memory of the past." (p. 249) He advises Muslims that if they bring these two worlds together by implementing the Ihsan principle in the public sphere, then the Islamist threat would be destined to end. After the introductory chapter, Khan goes on in chapter 2 to demonstrate that the principle of Ihsan could not find a place in the development of Islamic law after the prophet. Chapter 3 is intended to survey Muslim approaches to modernity and lists Modernists, Islamists, Traditionalists as major camps, among which he explicitly favors the Modernist approach.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
ISLAM AND CIVILISATIONAL RENEWAL BOOK REVIEWIslam and Civilizational Renewal,  2020The work currently under review, by M. A. Muqtedar Khan, professor at the University of Delware (... more The work currently under review, by M. A. Muqtedar Khan, professor at the University of Delware (USA) and expert in Islamic thought, governance and international relations, is a unique addition to the subject area, exploring new dimensions of Islamic political philosophy. A serious, critical evaluation of the subject-theory visa -vis practice-Khan challenges the many political understandings held by classical and modern Islamic political thinkers. Human minds (irrespective of their religious bents) have searched through the ages for a world order capable of providing peace and tranquillity to all people. Consequently, a number of political theories have emerged deliberating on the process and structure of governance and government. Disappointed with conventional forms of government (viz. democracy, secularism, socialism, republicanism and presidential) Muslim scholars have attempted to present a valid and universal alternative capable of transforming contemporary scenes of chaos and confusion into something resembling order. In the recent past, however, Muslim scholars and other Islamic reform movements have failed to convince humanity (especially people of different faiths) that the Islamic approach to good governance is the solution modern minds are searching for. As in his prior publication on Islamic political thought, Khan here presents his subject in a different and unique way, anchoring the political philosophy of Islam to its most recommended principle of ihsan (excellence). The book is a brief yet critical and comprehensive treatment of Islamic political thought spread over eight chapters, including an introduction (pp.1-8) and conclusion (pp.247-50). The book also contains a bibliography (pp.251-69) and index (pp.271-8).

Islamic philosophy has a unique dimension-it encompasses science and spirituality along with reason and logic. Arguing that perhaps the decline of philosophy was an important element in the decline of Islamic civilization, the paper contends that Muslim efforts at negotiating modernity or appropriating science will not be successful without the support of a rejuvenated Islamic philosophical tradition.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This article argues that use of force and violence for political change is making things worse as one can witness in Syria and Iraq. The article advances a Qur’ānic perspective on the desirability of peace as a goal and peaceful means as instruments of change. The article acknowledges that the Qur’ānic sanction for use of force to defend religious freedom prcludes the advocacy of pacifism but nevertheless the article does make a strong case for privileging peace over use of force.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The voices of Islamic modernism from South AsiaThe Routledge International Handbook of Contemporary Muslim Socio-Political Thought,  2021Islamic modernism is a rich Islamic intellectual tradition and it permeates the thinking of many ... more Islamic modernism is a rich Islamic intellectual tradition and it permeates the thinking of many scholars, intellectuals, reformists, and poets in South Asia. Even in the Muslim communities of South Asia, especially among the educated urban classes and in their foreign diasporas, one can find modernist thinking deeply entrenched. It has empowered Muslims to practice Islam paying great attention to its rituals and its traditions while also pursuing modern scientific education, and contributing to science and modern economic and political development. Even those who belong to the school of reformist Islam are informed by the modernist perspective. Slowly and steadily, one can argue, there is an intellectual modernization taking place among Muslims in Turkey, Pakistan, Malaysia, India, Indonesia, Egypt, Iran, and Morocco, even as there is a rise neotraditionally. The main modernist ideas that are taking root are that Islam can adapt to different time-space contexts through ijtihad. Islam is compatible with modernity, and the so-called new and modern values of democracy, freedom, political equality, gender justice, scientific outlook, rational and critical thinking, and even secularism are not entirely alien to Islamic ethos. They, too, can be absorbed within the umbrella of Islamic ethos. The future is indeed going to be shaped by Islamic modernist thinking that seeks to balance tradition with newness.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The paper examines the geostrategic thinking of Bernard Lewis, Edward Said, and John Esposito, and their impact on Western perceptions of Islam. The paper submits that while Edward Said exposed the prejudice inherent in orientalist thought, it was John Esposito and a cohort of post-orientalist scholars who engaged in three critical debates with the orientalist to provide a more authentic vision of Islam and a more nuanced picture of the politics of the Muslim world. The paper however concedes that while post-orientalism has triumphed in the academic setting, the orientalist perspective still dominates the policy sphere and continues to shape American foreign policy.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The Voices of Islamic Modernism from South Asiaby Muqtedar Khan and İbrahim Enes AksuThe Routledge International Handbook of Contemporary Muslim Socio-Political Thought,  2022Islamic modernism is a rich Islamic intellectual tradition and it permeates the thinking of many ... more Islamic modernism is a rich Islamic intellectual tradition and it permeates the thinking of many scholars, intellectuals, reformists, and poets in South Asia. Even in the Muslim communities of South Asia, especially among the educated urban classes and in their foreign diasporas, one can find modernist thinking deeply entrenched. It has empowered Muslims to practice Islam paying great attention to its rituals and its traditions while also pursuing modern scientific education, and contributing to science and modern economic and political development. Even those who belong to the school of reformist Islam are informed by the modernist perspective. Slowly and steadily, one can argue, there is an intellectual modernization taking place among Muslims in Turkey, Pakistan, Malaysia, India, Indonesia, Egypt, Iran, and Morocco, even as there is a rise neotraditionally. The main modernist ideas that are taking root are that Islam can adapt to different time-space contexts through ijtihad. Islam is compatible with modernity, and the so-called new and modern values of democracy, freedom, political equality, gender justice, scientific outlook, rational and critical thinking, and even secularism are not entirely alien to Islamic ethos. They, too, can be absorbed within the umbrella of Islamic ethos. The future is indeed going to be shaped by Islamic modernist thinking that seeks to balance tradition with newness.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
