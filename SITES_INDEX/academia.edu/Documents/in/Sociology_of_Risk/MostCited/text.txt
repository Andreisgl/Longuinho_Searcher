This article explains and corrects these misunderstandings one by one and concludes with the Kuhnian insight that a scientific discipline without a large number of thoroughly executed case studies is a discipline without systematic production of exemplars, and a discipline without exemplars is an ineffective one. Social science may be strengthened by the execution of a greater number of good case studies.Save to LibraryDownloadby Bent Flyvbjerg•  958  Critical Theory, Business, Entrepreneurship, Organizational BehaviorUnderestimating Costs in Public Works Projects: Error or Lie?This article presents results from the first statistically significant study of cost escalation in transportation infrastructure projects.

Based on a sample of 258 transportation infrastructure projects worth US$90 billion and representing different project types, geographical regions, and historical periods, it is found with overwhelming statistical significance that the cost estimates used to decide whether such projects should be built are highly and systematically misleading. Underestimation cannot be explained by error and is best explained by strategic misrepresentation, that is, lying. The policy implications are clear: legislators, administrators, investors, media representatives, and members of the public who value honest numbers should not trust cost estimates and cost-benefit analyses produced by project promoters and their analysts.Save to LibraryDownloadby Bent Flyvbjerg•  969  Critical Theory, Business, Entrepreneurship, Organizational BehaviorRationality and Power: Democracy in PracticeBack cover text: If the new fin de siècle marks a recurrence of the real, Bent Flyvbjerg’s Rationality and Power epitomizes that development and sets new standards for social and political inquiry.

The Danish town of Aalborg is to Flyvbjerg what Florence was to Machiavelli: a laboratory for understanding the real workings of power, and for grasping what they mean to our more general concerns of social and political organization. Politics, administration, and planning are examined in ways that allow  a rare, in-depth understanding. The reader witnesses, firsthand, the classic and endless drama which defines what modernity and democracy are and can be.Save to LibraryDownloadby Bent Flyvbjerg•  959  Critical Theory, Business, Entrepreneurship, Organizational BehaviorThe Rise of Surveillance MedicineSave to LibraryDownloadby David Armstrong•  4  Sociology of Risk, Michel Foucault, Medical History, MedicalisationHow (In)accurate Are Demand Forecasts in Public Works Projects?

The sample used is the largest of its kind, covering 210 projects in 14 nations worth U.S.$59 billion. The study shows with very high statistical significance that forecasters generally do a poor job of estimating the demand for transportation infrastructure projects. For 9 out of 10 rail projects, passenger forecasts are overestimated; the average overestimation is 106%. For half of all road projects, the difference between actual and forecasted traffic is more than ±20%. The result is substantial financial risks, which are typically ignored or downplayed by planners and decision makers to the detriment of social and economic welfare. Our data also show that forecasts have not become more accurate over the 30-year period studied, despite claims to the contrary by forecasters. The causes of inaccuracy in forecasts are different for rail and road projects, with political causes playing a larger role for rail than for road. The cure is transparency, accountability, and new forecasting methods. The challenge is to change the governance structures for forecasting and project development. Our article shows how planners may help achieve this.Save to LibraryDownloadby Bent Flyvbjerg•  966  Critical Theory, Business, Entrepreneurship, Organizational BehaviorRisk as Moral Danger: the Social and Political Functions of Risk Discourse in Public HealthSave to LibraryDownloadby Deborah Lupton•  4  Medical Sociology, Critical Medical Anthropology, Sociology of Risk, Sociology of HealthSurvival of the Un-fittest: Why the Worst Infrastructure Gets Built - and What We Can Do about ItThe article first describes characteristics of major infrastructure projects.

Second, it documents a much neglected topic in economics: that ex ante estimates of costs and benefits are often very different from actual ex post costs and benefits. For large infrastructure projects the consequences are cost overruns, benefit shortfalls, and the systematic underestimation of risks. Third, implications for cost–benefit analysis are described, including that such analysis is not to be trusted for major infrastructure projects. Fourth, the article uncovers the causes of this state of affairs in terms of perverse incentives that encourage promoters to underestimate costs and overestimate benefits in the business cases for their projects. But the projects that are made to look best on paper are the projects that amass the highest cost overruns and benefit shortfalls in reality. The article depicts this situation as ‘survival of the unfittest’. Fifth, the article sets out to explain how the problem may be solved, with a view to arriving at more efficient and more democratic projects, and avoiding the scandals that often accompany major infrastructure investments. Finally, the article identifies current trends in major infrastructure development. It is argued that a rapid increase in stimulus spending, combined with more investments in emerging economies, combined with more spending on information technology is catapulting infrastructure investment from the frying pan into the fire.Save to LibraryDownloadby Bent Flyvbjerg•  967  Critical Theory, Business, Entrepreneurship, Organizational BehaviorDefining and experiencing dangerous climate changeUnderstanding what constitutes dangerous climate change is of critical importance for future concerted action (Schneider, 2001, 2002).

To date separate scientific and policy discourses have proceeded with competing and somewhat arbitrary definitions of danger based on a variety of assumptions and assessments generally undertaken by ‘experts’. We argue that it is not possible to make progress on defining dangerous climate change, or in developing sustainable responses to this global problem, without recognising the central role played by social or individual perceptionsof danger. There are therefore at least two contrasting perspectives on dangerous climate change, what we term ‘external’ and ‘internal’ definitions of risk. External definitions are usually based on scientific risk analysis, performed by experts, of system characteristics of the physical or socialworld. Internal definitions of danger recognise that to be real, danger has to be either experienced or perceived – it is the individual or collective experience or perception of insecurity or lack of safety that constitutes the danger. A robust policy response must appreciate both external and internaldefinitions of danger.Save to LibraryDownloadby Mike Hulme•  2  Climate Change, Sociology of RiskPhronetic Planning Research: Theoretical and Methodological ReflectionsThis article presents the theoretical and methodological considerations behind a research method which the author calls ‘phronetic planning research’.

Such research sets out to answer four questions of power and values for specific instances of planning: (1) Where are we going with planning? (2) Who gains and who loses, and by which mechanisms of power? (3) Is this development desirable? (4) What, if anything, should we do about it? A central task of phronetic planning research is to provide concrete examples and detailed narratives of the ways in which power and values work in planning and with what consequences to whom, and to suggest how relations of power and values could be changed to work with other consequences. Insofar as planning situations become clear, they are clarified by detailed stories of who is doing what to whom. Clarifications of that kind are a principal concern for phronetic planning research and provide the main link to praxis.Save to LibraryDownloadby Bent Flyvbjerg•  958  Critical Theory, Business, Entrepreneurship, Organizational BehaviorPolicy and Planning for Large-Infrastructure Projects: Problems, Causes, CuresThis paper focuses on problems and their causes and cures in policy and planning for large-infrastructure projects.

First, it identifies as the main problem in major infrastructure developments pervasive misinformation about the costs, benefits, and risks involved. A consequence of misinformation is cost overruns, benefit shortfalls, and waste. Second, it explores the causes of misinformation and finds that political-economic explanations best account for the available evidence: planners and promoters deliberately misrepresent costs, benefits, and risks in order to increase the likelihood that it is their projects, and not those of their competition, that gain approval and funding. This results in the ‘survival of the unfittest’, in which often it is not the best projects that are built, but the most misrepresented ones. Finally, it presents measures for reforming policy and planning for large-infrastructure projects with a focus on better planning methods and changed governance structures, the latter being more important.Save to LibraryDownloadby Bent Flyvbjerg•  967  Critical Theory, Business, Entrepreneurship, Organizational BehaviorFrom Nobel Prize to Project Management: Getting Risks RightA major source of risk in project management is inaccurate forecasts of project costs, demand, and other impacts.

The paper presents a promising new approach to mitigating such risk, based on theories of decision making under uncertainty which won the 2002 Nobel prize in economics. First, the paper documents inaccuracy and risk in project management. Second, it explains inaccuracy in terms of optimism bias and strategic misrepresentation. Third, the theoretical basis is presented for a promising new method called "reference class forecasting," which achieves accuracy by basing forecasts on actual performance in a reference class of comparable projects and thereby bypassing both optimism bias and strategic misrepresentation. Fourth, the paper presents the first instance of practical reference class forecasting, which concerns cost forecasts for large transportation infrastructure projects. Finally, potentials for and barriers to reference class forecasting are assessed.Save to LibraryDownloadby Bent Flyvbjerg•  969  Critical Theory, Business, Entrepreneurship, Organizational BehaviorHabermas and Foucault: Thinkers for Civil Society?Taken together, the works of Jurgen Habermas and Michel Foucault highlight an essential tension in modernity.

This is the tension between the normative and the real, between what should be done and what is actually done. Understanding this tension is crucial to understanding modern democracy, what it is and what it could be. It has been argued that an effective way of making democracy stronger is to strengthen civil society. This article contains a comparative analysis of the central ideas of Habermas and Foucault as they pertain to the question of democracy and civil society. More specifically, the discourse ethics of Habermas is contrasted with the power analytics and ethics of Foucault evaluating their usefulness for those interested in understanding, and bringing about, democratic social change.Save to LibraryDownloadby Bent Flyvbjerg•  958  Critical Theory, Business, Entrepreneurship, Organizational BehaviorDelusion and Deception in Large Infrastructure Projects: Two Models for Explaining and Preventing Executive Disaster"Over budget, over time, over and over again" appears to be an appropriate slogan for large, complex infrastructure projects.

This article explains why cost, benefits, and time forecasts for such projects are systematically over-optimistic in the planning phase. The underlying reasons for forecasting errors are grouped into three categories: delusions or honest mistakes; deceptions or strategic manipulation of information or processes; or bad luck. Delusion and deception have each been addressed in the management literature before, but here they are jointly considered for the first time. They are specifically applied to infrastructure problems in a manner that allows both academics and practitioners to understand and implement the suggested corrective procedures. The article provides a framework for analyzing the relative explanatory power of delusion and deception. It also suggests a simplified framework for analyzing the complex principal-agent relationships that are involved in the approval and construction of large infrastructure projects, which can be used to improve forecasts. Finally, the article illustrates reference class forecasting, an outside view de-biasing technique that has proven successful in overcoming both delusion and deception in private and public investment decisions.Save to LibraryDownloadby Bent Flyvbjerg•  967  Critical Theory, Business, Entrepreneurship, Organizational BehaviorSocial work in a risk society: Social and political perspectivesSave to LibraryDownloadby Stephen Webb•  8  Social Work, Risk Governance, Risk regulation, Sociology of RiskPlanning and Foucault: In Search of the Dark Side of Planning TheoryIn this paper we argue that the use of the communicative theory of Jürgen Habermas in planning theory is problematic because it hampers an understanding of how power shapes planning.

We posit an alternative approach based on the power analytics of Michel Foucault which focuses on ‘what is actually done’, as opposed to Habermas’s focus on ‘what should be done’. We discuss how the Foucauldian stance problematises planning, asking difficult questions about the treatment of legitimacy, rationality, knowledge and spatiality. We conclude that Foucault offers a type of analytic planning theory which offers better prospects than does Habermas for those interested in understanding and bringing about democratic social change through planning.Save to LibraryDownloadby Bent Flyvbjerg•  959  Critical Theory, Business, Entrepreneurship, Organizational BehaviorBringing Power to Planning Research: One Researcher's Praxis StoryThis article provides an answer to what has been called the biggest problem in theorizing and understanding planning: the ambivalence about power found among planning researchers, theorists, and students.

The author narrates how he came to work with issues of power and gives an example of how the methodology he developed for power studies—phronetic planning research—may be employed in practice. Phronetic planning research follows the tradition of power studies running from Machiavelli and Nietzsche to Michel Foucault and Pierre Bourdieu. It focuses on four value-rational questions: (1) Where are we going with planning? (2) Who gains and who loses, and by which mechanisms of power? (3) Is this development desirable? (4) What should be done? These questions are exemplified for a specific instance of Scandinavian urban planning. The author finds that the questions, and their answers, make a difference to planning in practice. They make planning research matter.Save to LibraryDownloadby Bent Flyvbjerg•  958  Critical Theory, Business, Entrepreneurship, Organizational BehaviorProcedures for Dealing with Optimism Bias in Transport PlanningThe Supplementary Green Book Guidance on Optimism Bias (HM Treasury 2003) with reference to the Review of Large Public Procurement in the UK (Mott MacDonald 2002) notes that there is a demonstrated, systematic, tendency for project... moreThe Supplementary Green Book Guidance on Optimism Bias (HM Treasury 2003) with reference to the Review of Large Public Procurement in the UK (Mott MacDonald 2002) notes that there is a demonstrated, systematic, tendency for project appraisers to be overly optimistic and that to redress this tendency appraisers should make explicit, empirically based adjustments to the estimates of a project’s costs, benefits, and duration. HM Treasury recommends that these adjustments be based on data from past projects or similar projects elsewhere, and adjusted for the unique characteristics of the project in hand. In the absence of a more specific evidence base, HM Treasury has encouraged departments to collect data to inform future estimates of optimism, and in the meantime use the best available data. In response to this, the Department for Transport (henceforth DfT), has contracted Bent Flyvbjerg in association with COWI to undertake the consultancy assignment "Procedures for dealing with Optimism Bias in Transport Planning". The present Guidance Document is the result of this assignment.Save to LibraryDownloadby Bent Flyvbjerg•  968  Critical Theory, Business, Entrepreneurship, Organizational Behavior'Precious cargo': foetal subjects, risk and reproductive citizenshipIn the interests of promoting the health and wellbeing of their foetuses, pregnant women are subject to imperatives which expect them to engage in an intense ascetic regime of self-regulation and disciplining of their bodies.

This review article draws upon scholarship from the humanities and social sciences on pregnancy, foetal personhood and risk to explain why, at this particular moment in the history of western societies, pregnant women and their foetuses are such potent focal points for regulation, monitoring and control. It is argued that in recent years the foetus has become fetishised as a precious body to the exclusion of the pregnant woman's needs and rights. Biomedical technologies have played an important role in the construction of the contemporary foetal body and the meanings which surround it, as have the discourses and practices of neoliberal politics and risk society.Save to LibraryDownloadby Deborah Lupton•  10  Sociology, Critical Medical Studies, Children and Families, Critical Medical AnthropologyRationality and PowerThe Aalborg Project may be interpreted as a metaphor of modern politics, modern administration and planning, and of modernity itself.

The basic idea of the project was comprehensive, coherent, and innovative, and it was based on rational and democratic argument.

Working in a counter-tradition that is suspicious of a number of governing ideas and practices in social work, it draws on themes in the work of theorists such as Foucault, Giddens, and Rose. It looks at risk, trust, regulation, identity, and governmentality to explore the impact of risk society and neoliberalism on social work.

In this article, we first examine AVs and different categories of the technological risks associated with them. We then explore strategies that can be adopted to address these risks, and explore emerging responses by governments for addressing AV risks. Our analyses reveal that, thus far, governments have in most instances avoided stringent measures in order to promote AV developments and the majority of responses are non-binding and focus on creating councils or working groups to better explore AV implications. The US has been active in introducing legislations to address issues related to privacy and cybersecurity. The UK and Germany, in particular, have enacted laws to address liability issues; other countries mostly acknowledge these issues, but have yet to implement specific strategies. To address privacy and cybersecurity risks strategies ranging from introduction or amendment of non-AV specific legislation to creating working groups have been adopted. Much less attention has been paid to issues such as environmental and employment risks, although a few governments have begun programmes to retrain workers who might be negatively affected.Save to LibraryDownloadby Araz 𝖳aeihagh and +1Hazel Lim•  300  Business, Information Systems, Management, Risk Management and Insurance1.10 Making Organization Research Matter: Power, Values and PhronesisSave to LibraryDownloadby Frank Meier•  940  Critical Theory, Business, Entrepreneurship, Organizational BehaviorCost Overruns and Demand Shortfalls in Urban Rail and Other InfrastructureRisk, including economic risk, is increasingly a concern for public policy and management.

The possibility of dealing effectively with risk is hampered, however, by lack of a sound empirical basis for risk assessment and management. This article demonstrates the general point for cost and demand risks in urban rail projects. The article presents empirical evidence that allow valid economic risk assessment and management of urban rail projects, including benchmarking of individual or groups of projects. Benchmarking of the Copenhagen Metro is presented as a case in point. The approach developed is proposed as a model for other types of policies and projects in order to improve economic and financial risk assessment and management in policy and planning.Save to LibraryDownloadby Bent Flyvbjerg•  969  Critical Theory, Business, Entrepreneurship, Organizational BehaviorQuality Control and Due Diligence in Project Management: Getting Decisions Right by Taking the Outside ViewThis paper explores how theories of the planning fallacy and the outside view may be used to conduct quality control and due diligence in project management.

First, a much-neglected issue in project management is identified, namely that the front-end estimates of costs and benefits – used in the business cases, cost-benefit analyses, and social and environmental impact assessments that typically support decisions on projects – are typically significantly different from actual ex post costs and benefits, and are therefore poor predictors of the actual value and viability of projects. Second, it is discussed how Kahneman and Tversky’s theories of the planning fallacy and the outside view may help explain and remedy this situation through quality control of decisions. Third, it is described what quality control and due diligence are in the context of project management, and an eight-step procedure is outlined for due diligence based on the outside view. Fourth, the procedure is tested on a real-life, multibillion-dollar project, organized as a public-private partnership. Finally, Akerlof and Shiller’s recent discussion in economics of “firing the forecaster” is discussed together with its relevance to project management. In sum, the paper demonstrates the need, the theoretical basis, a practical methodology, and a real-life example for how to de-bias project management using quality control and due diligence based on the outside view.Save to LibraryDownloadby Bent Flyvbjerg•  966  Critical Theory, Business, Entrepreneurship, Organizational BehaviorGuest editors’ introduction to special issue on ‘Leisure, Tourism and Risk'Save to LibraryDownloadby Scott Cohen•  8  Tourism Studies, Recreation & Leisure Studies, Sociology of Risk, RiskThe Dark Side of Planning: Rationality and "Realrationalität"Niccolò Machiavelli, the founder of modern political and administrative thought, made clear that an understanding of politics requires distinguishing between formal politics and what later, with Ludwig von Rochau, would become known as... moreNiccolò Machiavelli, the founder of modern political and administrative thought, made clear that an understanding of politics requires distinguishing between formal politics and what later, with Ludwig von Rochau, would become known as Realpolitik.

Despite this, they have been propelled to the forefront of the political agenda. Using an innovative theoretical approach, this book examines how, under what conditions, by whom, for what reasons, and with what impact cyber-threats have been moved on to the political agenda. In particular, it analyses how governments have used threat frames, specific interpretive schemata about what counts as a threat or risk and how to respond to this threat. By approaching this subject from a security studies angle, this book closes a gap between practical and theoretical academic approaches. It also contributes to the more general debate about changing practices of national security and their implications for the international community.Save to LibraryDownloadby Myriam Dunn Cavelty•  8  Information Warfare, Security Studies, Sociology of Risk, Risk ManagementOlympic Proportions: Cost and Cost Overrun at the Olympics 1960-2012Do different types of megaprojects have different cost overruns?

This apparently simple question is at the heart of research at the University of Oxford aimed at understanding the characteristics of megaprojects, particularly in terms of how they are established, run and concluded. In this study, we set out to investigate cost overruns in the Olympic Games. To do so, we examined the costs of the Games over half a century, including both summer and winter Olympics. We looked at the evolution of final reported costs and compared these to the costs established in the Games bids, submitted to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) up to seven years before the Games occurred. In so doing we established the largest dataset of its kind, and documented for the first time in a consistent fashion the costs and cost overruns for the Olympic Games, from 1960 to 2012. We discovered that the Games stand out in two distinct ways compared to other megaprojects: (1) The Games overrun with 100 per cent consistency. No other type of megaproject is this consistent regarding cost overrun. Other project types are typically on budget from time to time, but not the Olympics. (2) With an average cost overrun in real terms of 179 per cent – and 324 per cent in nominal terms – overruns in the Games have historically been significantly larger than for other types of megaprojects, including infrastructure, construction, ICT, and dams. The data thus show that for a city and nation to decide to host the Olympic Games is to take on one of the most financially risky type of megaproject that exists, something that many cities and nations have learned to their peril. For the London 2012 Games, we find that: (1) With sports-related real costs currently estimated at USD14.8 billion, London is on track to become the most costly Olympics ever. (2) With a projected cost overrun of 101 per cent in real terms, overrun for London is below the historical average for the Games, but not significantly so. (3) The London cost overrun is, however, significantly higher than overruns for recent Games since 1999. London therefore is reversing a positive trend of falling cost overruns for the Games.Save to LibraryDownloadby Bent Flyvbjerg•  967  Critical Theory, Business, Entrepreneurship, Organizational BehaviorContradictory Approaches? – On Realism and Constructivism in the Social Sciences Research on Risk, Technology and the EnvironmentThis article discusses approaches to researching the risk-problems of industrial societies.

It examines why the risk-constructivism neglects questions of the material production of risks in favor of questions of their communicative construction, while the risk-realism does it the other way round. Subsequently the possibilities of a synthesis of both approaches are being considered. The societal functions of risk-constructions are accordingly not limited to their efficacy in the sphere of social communication processes. They lie as well in the field of regulation of the metabolism of societies and their ecological environment. The validity of risk-constructions is consequently not only bound to their cultural weightiness, whether one believes in them or not, but to their capacity to manage realities, measured by their ability to bring expectations in accordance with events. Risk-constructions are not only transformed in the milieu of discourses, but also in the context of social practices which give the opportunity to acquire experiences and to perform learning processes in order to optimize risk-constructions as regulative instruments.Save to LibraryDownloadby Andreas Metzner-Szigeth•  27  Sociology, Future Studies, Environmental Science, AnthropologyLearning to organise risk management in organisations: what future for enterprise risk management?Enterprise risk management (ERM) was originally developed to manage financial risks and was later transferred to other businesses, sectors and, crucially, government.

ERM aims at a maximum of comprehensiveness suggesting the integration of all risks to an organisation’s objective in a portfolio to inform organisational strategy. However, the concept suffers from unknown interdependencies between risks, implementation strategies that lack empirical validation and ambivalences and uncertainties arising from their management. It is only weakly rooted in organisational theory. Drawing on knowledge generation, theory key aspects for the empirical study of risk management in organisations are identified. These address the commensuration of risks, the comprehensiveness of the risk portfolio and the communication of explicit and tacit knowledge enabling organisational learning processes in different institutional contexts.Save to LibraryDownloadby Frank Schiller•  4  Sociology of Risk, Risk Management, Politics And Sociology Of Risk, Enterprise risk managementSeeking health information on the internet: lifestyle choice or bad attack of cyberchondria?Save to LibraryDownloadby Tania Lewis•  8  Health Communication, Internet Studies, Class, Sociology of RiskCOVID-19, the Climate, and Transformative Change: Comparing the Social Anatomies of Crises and Their Regulatory ResponsesDespite forces struggling to reduce global warming growing stronger, there has been mixed success in generating substantive policy implementation, while the global spread of the coronavirus has prompted strong and far-reaching... moreDespite forces struggling to reduce global warming growing stronger, there has been mixed success in generating substantive policy implementation, while the global spread of the coronavirus has prompted strong and far-reaching governmental responses around the world. This paper addresses the complex and partly contradictory responses to these two crises, investigating their social anatomies. Using temporality, spatiality, and epistemic authority as the main conceptual vehicles, the two crises are systematically compared. Despite sharing a number of similarities, the most striking difference between the two crises is the urgency of action to counter the rapid spread of the pandemic as compared to the slow and meager action to mitigate longstanding, well-documented, and accelerating climate change. Although the tide now seems to have turned towards a quick and massive effort to restore the status quo-including attempts to restart the existing economic growth models, which imply an obvious risk for substantially increasing CO 2 emissions-the article finally points at some signs of an opening window of opportunity for green growth and degrowth initiatives. However, these signs have to be realistically interpreted in relation to the broader context of power relations in terms of governance configurations and regulatory strategies worldwide at different levels of society.Save to LibraryDownloadby Rolf Lidskog•  10  Climate Change, Regulation And Governance, Risk Governance, Sociology of RiskCorrupt Governmental Networks"ABSTRACT: This study provides an empirically based analysis of corrupt governmental networks.

We conducted 45 interviews in Hungary with different organizational actors who were actually participating in corrupt transactions or at least had first-handexperiences of corruption. Given the secret nature of the topic, this article provides a unique insight into the phenomenon. Our findings show that corrupt elite cliques consciously design and coordinate multilevel structures of corrupt networks within and among organizations that involve a large amount of people. We identified the major network elements and their functions in corrupt transactions. The article also provides a typology of corrupt networks. The networks have different structural characteristics based on location of the ‘‘cash cows,’’ points from where the system is fed, and the actors’ positions of power. Our findings are compared with the already existing literature on dark networks, terrorist, and organized crime formations."Save to LibraryDownloadby David Jancsics•  175  Business, Entrepreneurship, Organizational Behavior, ManagementPatients’ responses to risk information about the benefits of treating hypertensionSave to LibraryDownloadby David Armstrong•  3  Primary Health Care, Health Behaviour Change, Sociology of RiskThe Environmental Justice Movement as a Model Politics of Risk (Polity)Risk carries unique significance for democratic politics today as it faces the challenges of rising inequality, neoliberalism, and systemic racism.

To show how, the article divides "risk" into two complementary political models: a technocratic logic of risk allocation, concerned primarily with safety, and a forensic logic of risk attribution, concerned with holding risk takers and risky policies to account. Both have had pervasive effects on a transformed welfare state, increasingly focused on "personal responsibility" and privatized risk-management. But risk has also played a key role in the way post-1968 movements have organized and challenged the logic of privatization. Risk-based movements, the article argues, especially from the political margins, are key agents in promoting a new political form founded on risk attribution. The article focuses on the exemplary case of the American environmental justice movement in the 1980s and 90s as it reframed social justice around three core demands: accountability from decisions makers, equitable risk distribution (including redress for extreme inequities, past and present), and broad participation in decisions about danger and communities' well-being.Save to LibraryDownloadby Roni  Hirsch•  6  Social Movements, Sociology of Risk, Environmental Justice, Participatory DemocracyRisk, responsibility and reconfigurationSave to LibraryDownloadby Cyrus Tata and +1Simon Halliday•  4  Governmentality, Sociology of Risk, Penology, SentencingHistory, space, and power: theoretical and methodological problems in the research on areas at (industrial) risk, “Journal of Risk Research”, 15, 9-10, 2012, pp. 1299-1317.The present article discusses methods and theoretical problems in the research on areas at industrial risk, using examples and problems deriving from studies conducted in Sicily, as well as the review of a number of contemporary studies.... moreThe present article discusses methods and theoretical problems in the research on areas at industrial risk, using examples and problems deriving from studies conducted in Sicily, as well as the review of a number of contemporary studies. The author argues that much of the contemporary research on areas at risk focuses on the ‘elites’ (environmental movements, boards of citizens, and the like) rather than on populations, and does not reflect on the general ambivalence of the inhabitants. This tendency is also related to the frequent lack of historical analyses on the milieus hosting industrial plants, and the rhetoric employed by authoritiesand charismatic leaders in order to convince the populations to accept the industries into their territories. The author also reflects on the concept of space and notices that many studies focus mostly on the process of production of slums, neglecting the role of the industrial villages in the creation of perceptions and attitudes towards industry. In a similar manner, the state of local economies is often ignored in many analyses, so that considerations on the possibilities for alternative models of development are not provided. Yet, in spite of the fact that the current debate on risk is characterized by critical approaches, a number of studies appear to be implicitly conservative and cooperative with regard to state and capital and do not adequately reflect on the role of power in determining narratives and behaviors in areas at risk.Save to LibraryDownloadby Pietro Saitta•  6  Development Studies, Social Research Methods and Methodology, Sociology of Risk, Urban StudiesThe Importance of Culture and Context: Rethinking Risk and Risk Management in Young Drug-Using Populations.

The paper argues that debates over biosecurity can be conceptualised as arguments over the ability to regulate flows of disease and the constructions of space they adopt. Data from parliamentary inquiries and interviews are used to show how attempts to institutionalise forms of biosecurity emerge from a delicate balance of prescribed and negotiated spaces configured by a host of social, natural, and material agents. The interaction between these spaces provides a way of regulating the flows of disease and purifying agricultural space. This balance is resisted by farmers, whose practical knowledges of the constant struggle of managing the contingencies of agriculture lead them to suggest that only uniform versions of space can effectively regulate flows of disease. The author concludes by discussing the importance of recognising these differences for future biosecurity and animal health policy.Save to LibraryDownloadby Gareth  Enticott•  9  Geography, Computer Networks, Sociology of Risk, Human-wildlife conflictsManagerial risk-taking in international acquisitions in the breweryindustry: Institutional and ownership influences comparedSave to LibraryDownloadby Mike Geppert•  13  Organizational Theory, Corporate Social Responsibility, International Business, Mergers & AcquisitionsClausewitz and the politics of war: A contemporary theoryThis paper re-examines the theoretical underpinnings of Strategic Studies, proposing a novel theory and a new framework for analysing war’s fundamental relationship with politics in line with the Clausewitzian tradition. Throughout modern... moreThis paper re-examines the theoretical underpinnings of Strategic Studies, proposing a novel theory and a new framework for analysing war’s fundamental relationship with politics in line with the Clausewitzian tradition. Throughout modern history, Clausewitz’s concept of politics has been misconstrued as referring only to policy whereas in fact, for him, ‘politics’ was a much broader concept, including domestic power struggles. The political logic of war is defined here as the convergence of the interrelating factors of power struggles and policy objectives within a given polity that restrains and enables these political forces. The analysis of the Clausewitzian political logic of war is conducted through the sociological ‘liquid modern’ lens. It is argued that with power increasingly shifting from centralised state-oriented political leadership towards market forces, non-state actors and other political bodies, the effectiveness of war has been reduced. This is evident in the fragmentation of Western political systems and, as a result, suboptimal strategy and the domination of domestic power struggles in political decision-making concerning war.Save to LibraryDownloadby George Dimitriu•  20  Strategy (Military Science), Peace and Conflict Studies, Conflict, War StudiesUncertain Times The notion of 'risk' and the development of modernityThis article examines the ways in which understand-ings of uncertainty have evolved during the development of modern-ity, and in particular, how they are expressed in the notion of 'risk'.

It demonstrates how this concept is embedded in socioeconomic contexts and grounded in particular temporal orientations, specifically as expressed in notions of determinism and indeterminism. It suggests that, although the concept of risk initially embodied an orientation to the future as something that was predictable and open to human intervention, transformations in the structure of capitalism mean that its utility is now to be found in its role as a guide for action in late modern societies, in which the future has 'collapsed' into an indeterminate present.

Few empirical studies of engagement exist and a lack of explicit conceptualisations impedes effective measurement, research and the development of evidence-based engagement interventions.Aims This article (1) develops a widely applicable conceptualisation, (2) considers various methodological challenges to researching engagement, proposing some solutions, and (3) outlines a basis for converting the conceptualisation into specific measures and indicators of engagement among stakeholders.Method We synthesise social science work on risk governance and public understandings of science with insights from studies in the pharmacovigilance field. Findings This leads us to define engagement as an ongoing process of knowledge exchange among stakeholders, with the adoption of this knowledge as the outcome which may feed back into engagement processes over time. We conceptualise this process via three dimensions; breadth, depth and texture. In addressing challenges to capturing each dimension, we emphasise the importance of combining survey approaches with qualitative studies and secondary data on medicines use, prescribing, adverse reaction reporting and health outcomes. A framework for evaluating engagement intervention processes and outcomes is proposed. Alongside measuring engagement via breadth and depth, we highlight the need to research the engagement process through attentiveness to texture — what engagement feels like, what it means to people, and how this shapes motivations based on values, emotions, trust and rationales.Conclusion Capturing all three dimensions of engagement is vital to develop valid understandings of what works and why, thus informing engagement interventions of patients and healthcare professionals to given regulatory pharmacovigilance scenarios.Save to LibraryDownloadby Patrick Brown•  13  Pharmacy, Regulation And Governance, Community Engagement & Participation, Risk GovernanceRisk and the welfare stateSave to LibraryDownloadby Hartley Dean and +1Peter Taylor-Gooby•  3  Welfare State, Sociology of Risk, Public PolicyQuantifying citizens: neoliberal restructuring and immigrant selection in Canada and AustraliaThis article analyzes the ways in which Canadian and Australian immigration policies represent causes and consequences of neoliberal restructuring.

Interrogating neoliberalism as a series of political-economic and moral changes derived from the marketization of societal and governmental arrangements, it illustrates how numerically-based ‘points systems’ have been employed as mechanisms for: gauging human capital; establishing indices of risk and undesirability; and promoting the ‘responsibilization’ of incoming migrants. In doing so the points systems' historical trajectory is traced through a variety of administrative reforms characteristic of neoliberal government and flexible accumulation. Ultimately, this article contends that as rational, technical and economically guided systems of enumeration and assessment, both governments' policies mirror, enhance and extend neoliberal arrangements and sensibilities. In providing ostensibly objective techniques of evaluation the points systems have assisted in injecting the ideal neoliberal citizens- who are, above all, flexible, cosmopolitan, entrepreneurial and autonomous- from abroad. Overall this paper contributes to studies of state restructuring by providing new insights into the links between the neglected domain of immigration control and emergent techniques of societal regulation and citizen-making.Save to LibraryDownloadby James  Walsh•  193  Critical Theory, Critical Theory, Risk Management and Insurance, ReligionChaos, Order, and Collaboration: Toward a Feminist Conceptualization of EdgeworkStephen Lyng’s concept of edgework represents a crucial shift in understanding particular kinds of risk taking, as intrinsically and phenomenologically rewarding.

Although it has been widely and usefully used since then, scholars have observed limitations in its applicability across class, race, and gender lines. A good deal of recent work has endeavored to address this problem. However, a critical feminist perspective reveals the levels on which this issue is not merely one of scope but a paradigmatic issue. I offer a deconstruction of the edgework concept in order to illustrate this, and an expansion of the model in order to render it more applicable for a wider range of thrill-seeking behaviors. Drawing on four years of ethnographic field work in an SM (sadomasochism) community, I provide an empirical example of the applicability of this amendment for the study of voluntary risk taking across gender boundaries.Save to LibraryDownloadby Staci Newmahr•  7  Feminist Theory, Sociology of Risk, Gender, FeminismNanotechnology, Contingency and FinitudeIt is argued that the social significance of nanotechnologies should be understood in terms of the politics and ethics of uncertainty.

This means that the uncertainties surrounding the present and future development of nanotechnologies should not be interpreted, first and foremost, in terms of concepts of risk. It is argued that risk, as a way of managing uncertain futures, has a particular historical genealogy, and as such implies a specific politics and ethics. It is proposed, instead, that the concepts of contingency and of finitude must be central to any understanding of the ethical significance of nanotechnologies, as these concepts can be used to understand the basis of recent work in science and technology studies, and the sociology of knowledge more widely, which details the multi-dimensional social nature of technological uncertainty.Save to LibraryDownloadby Christopher Groves•  8  Computer Networks, Sociology of Risk, Nanotechnology, DatabasesNextLast »Related TopicsRiskFollowFollowingRisk GovernanceFollowFollowingRisk and VulnerabilityFollowFollowingEnvironmental SociologyFollowFollowingScience and Technology StudiesFollowFollowingSociologyFollowFollowingPolitics And Sociology Of RiskFollowFollowingScience, Technology and SocietyFollowFollowingRisk ManagementFollowFollowingSoftwareFollowFollowing 71.6 million researchers use this site every month.
