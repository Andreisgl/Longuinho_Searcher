The purpose this study are determine the effectiveness of some media for the growth of Metarhizium anisopliae fungi done in vitro . Research using RAL with treatment of seven propagation media that is synthetic PDA media, corn, rice, husk, bran, bran and sawdust. The result showed that the highest growth percentage of Metarhizium anisopliae was found in 100% bran media with conidia density of 120.4 x 10 8 conidia / mg.

Padang rumput/padang penggembalaan yang selama ini menjadi andalan peternak dalam menyediakan pakan bagi ternak ruminansia, kini berkurang yang disebabkan oleh alih fungsi lahan. Penyebabnya adalah kurangnya pengetahuan masyarakat akan pentingnya keberadaan padang rumput/padang penggembalaan yang cukup. Tujuan pengabdian ini adalah mentransformasi ilmu, pengetahuan dan peningkatan kompetensi peternak tentang pemanfaatan bahan pakan lokal sebagai pakan ternak di Desa Lalabata Kecamatan Tanete Rilau Kabupaten Barru.  Metode yang digunakan adalah Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA).

A 60-day feeding experiment was conducted to potentially use ITTINSECT as fish meal replacement in the diets of rainbow trout. Five isonitrogenous in dry matter (38% crude protein) and isolipidic (15% crude lipid) diets were produced: a control diet (fishmeal-based) (ITT0) and four experimental diets replacing fishmeal by 25 (ITT25), 50 (ITT50), 75 (ITT75) and 100 (ITT100) %, with ITTINSECT™ APS V1. Triplicate tanks, containing 15 fish each (65.81 ± 1.26 g), were hand-fed to apparent satiation twice every day during the experiment.

Four isonitrogenous (30% CP) and isocaloric (420 Kcal 100 g-1 gross energy) experimental diets were prepared to conduct the study with different inclusion levels of BGLM viz., control (0 BGLM; 30% DORB), LM10 (10% BGLM, 20% DORB), LM20 (20% BGLM, 10% DORB) and LM30 (30% BGLM, 0% DORB). One hundred forty-four fishes with an initial mean weight of 3.52±0.04 g were arbitrarily assigned to the indoor experimental tubs in triplicates for the 60 days experiment.

Sunflower seed meal was fed to broilers as meal (MSFM) or after it had been pelleted (PSFM) at 75 °C and 360 kPa pressure to pass through a 3 mm mesh. Three diets were prepared, namely a balancer feed (BF) and two diets containing 200 g/kg MSFM or 200 g/kg PSFM. They were fed to 30 pens (two birds each) with male Ross 308 broilers, from 8 to 21 days old, following randomization. Data were analysed by ANOVA. Two pre-planned orthogonal contrast tests were performed to compare overall differences between the diets containing SFM and BF and between diets containing the MSFM and PSFM. The BF had a very different nutrient composition from the complete feeds containing SFM so, as expected, there were differences in growth performance and nutrient retention.

KUB chickens have faster growth compared to ordinary native chickens. This training program was conducted for the Koto Lua community, Pauh District, Padang City, West Sumatra. This activity aims to help the community by conducting training on making poultry rations using conventional feed ingredients. In addition, this activity also aims to introduce one of the potential local chickens producing meat and eggs, namely: KUB chicken. The methods used in this activity were counseling and discussion (conventional feed and KUB chickens), training (traditional preparation of ration), mentoring (KUB chicken rearing), and evaluation at the end of the activity. 100 KUB chickens are raised by the service team from 1-28 days (4 weeks); after that, the KUB chickens are given to 10 h...Save to LibraryDownloadby Ahadiyah Yuniza•The association between meal regularity and weight loss among women in commercial weight loss programsSave to LibraryDownloadby Junghoon Moon•  6  Obesity, Medicine, Weight Loss, Nutrition PracticeInfluence of Meal Kits Selection Attributes on Willingness to Buy At-home Concept and Eating-out Concept Meal KitsSave to LibraryDownloadby Junghoon Moon•  3  Psychology, Food Science, MealEffects of time-restricted feeding on supramaximal exercise performance and body composition: a randomized and counterbalanced crossover study in healthy menBackgroundUsing a crossover design, we explored the effects of both short- and long-term TRF vs. regular diet on Wingate (WnT) performance and body composition in well-trained young men.

This species can survive in the digestive tract, but, up to now, very few studies have considered its survival during the gastrointestinal digestion of meat. The present study aimed to investigate the survival of the pathogenic strain E. coli O157:H7 CM454 during the gastrointestinal digestion of ground beef meat and its interactions with meal components using a semidynamic digestive model. The CM454 strain in meat survived throughout digestion despite acidic pH (pH 2) and the presence of bile salts. The addition of nitrite and ascorbate in the digestion medium led to a decrease in strain survival. During digestion, a release of free iron was observed, which was accentuated in the presence of the CM454 strain. In addition, the strain modified the Fe2+/Fe3+ ratio, in favor of Fe2+ compared to the noninoculated meat sample.

The subjects received a meal proportional to their body size; therefore, the meal volume was different for each person. We investigated whether differences in the brain responses of obese and lean men to a meal represent satiety or feelings of gastric distension. We studied 9 lean (x +/- SD body fat: 15 +/- 5%; age: 33 +/- 10 y) and 9 obese (body fat: 31 +/- 4%; age: 32 +/- 10 y) men given a fixed amount (400 mL) of a liquid meal. We compared their results with those in 11 lean (body fat: 16 +/- 5%; age: 35 +/- 8 y) and 11 obese (body fat: 33 +/- 5%; age: 28 +/- 5 y) previously studied men given a meal proportional to their body size.

The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of different dietary concentrations of chia (Salvia hispanica) and flaxseed (Linum usitatissimum) meal on the omega-3 fatty acid content of tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) fillet. Six experimental diets incorporating 5, 10, and 15% chia or flaxseed meals, respectively, were given to the fish (238.36 ± 7.61 g, initial weight) for 45 days before harvesting. The α-linolenic acid (ALA) and n-3 PUFA contents in the fillet differed significantly among diets (P &lt; 0.05). Diets containing 15% chia or flaxseed meal had the highest concentrations of ALA (4.80 and 4.75%, respectively) and n-3 PUFA (13.65 and 15.92%, respectively).

US untrained consumers (n = 108), from the San Luis Obispo, CA area, were recruited to evaluate three food products (sausage, pasta, and brownies) as components in a three-course meal that either contain cricket powder (CP) or not (Control).

The CP Brownies were rated highly across the attributes, except for texture and aftertaste (p &lt; 0.05).

The aim of this work was to design a food pyramid illustrating the dietary pattern of an adult Moroccan population and compare it to the recommendations of the Mediterranean diet pyramid (MDP) updated in 2020 by a group of experts. The study was carried out over the period of 2018 to 2022, on 507 adults from the Rabat-Salé-Kenitra region in Morocco. Socio-demographic data, usability, and toxic habits were collected using a questionnaire. Physical activity was assessed by the Marshal questionnaire. Food intake and food diversity have been determined by food history and food variety by food frequency questionnaires.

Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengetahui pengaruh suplementasi dedak padi pada sapi PO calon induk terhadap konsumsi nutrien (BK, BO, PK, SK dan TDN), pertambahan berat badan harian (PBBH) dan profil darah (glukosa dan urea darah). Penelitian ini dilakukan di kelompok ternak Jaya Abadi dan Progo Jaya di Kota Probolinggo. Materi penelitian berupa 21 ekor sapi di kelompok Jaya Abadi dan 21 ekor sapi di kelompok Progo Jaya.
