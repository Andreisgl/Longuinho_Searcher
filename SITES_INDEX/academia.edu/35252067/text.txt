Recent geophysical studies include magnetotelluric (MT), deep seismic sounding (DSS), gravity, magnetic and deep resistivity soundings (DRS). In the present study, MT results along 140 km Andiyur-Turaiyur east-west profile is presented. The data are subjected to Groom-Bailey decomposition and static shift correction before deriving a 2-D model.Download Free PDFView PDFBULLETIN-GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF FINLANDThe geology, mineralogy and rare element geochemistry of the gem deposits of Sri Lanka2000 • Rohana ChandrajithThe gem deposits of Sri Lanka are studied from the point of view of their geology, mineralogy and geochemistry. Nearly all the gem formations are located in the central high-grade metamorphic terrain of the Highland Complex. The gem deposits are classified as sedimentary, metamorphic and magmatic; the sedimentary types being the most abundant. The mineralogy of the gem deposits varies widely with, among others, corundum, chrysoberyl, beryl, spinel, topaz, zircon, tourmaline, garnet and sphene being common. ...Download Free PDFView PDFGondwana ResearchThe Stream Sediment Geochemistry of the Walawe Ganga Basin of Sri Lanka - Implications for Gondwana Mineralization2000 • Rohana ChandrajithDownload Free PDFView PDFBLUE DUMORTIERITE FROM, HABARANA, SRI LANKA: FIELD OCCURRENCE AND MINERAL CHEMISTRYKeerthi PereraDownload Free PDFView PDFApplied GeochemistrySources of stream sediments in the granulite terrain of the Walawe Ganga Basin, Sri Lanka, indicated by rare earth element geochemistry2000 • Rohana ChandrajithDownload Free PDFView PDFShear zones & crustal blocks of southern IndiaShear zones & crustal blocks of southern India2018 • pradeep kumar, Shaji EPotential evidences for meteorite impact at Dhala, central India.

In this paper, we present a review of the structural-meta-morphic setting of the graphite veins and of the graphite stable carbon isotope data, and we present fluid inclusion data from quartz in the graphite veins and in the host rocks from several graphite deposits in Sri Lanka. The studied host rocks show decompression rims of plagioclase and orthopyroxene after garnet. The quartz in these decompression rim textures comprise, in order of abundance, high-salinity brine, H 2 O-CO 2 , and low-salinity aqueous fluid inclusions. The brine fluid is responsible for metasomatic features observed in garnet decompression rims, including feldspar leaching and re-precipitation. Quartz cogenetic with vein graphite comprises, in order of abundance, low-salinity aqueous, CO 2 , high-salinity brine, and H 2 O-CO 2 fluid inclusions. Published graphite carbon isotope data indicates a dominant mantle source, mixed with small amounts of carbon-bearing fluids of supracrustal origin. We propose that large quantities of mantle-derived CO 2 fluid are temporarily stored in the lower crust during the final stage of Gondwana supercontinent amalgamation. The CO 2 is subsequently released from the lower crustal rocks during decompression associated with fast uplift. The graphite veins in Sri Lanka were formed during this uplift stage and represent as such paleofluid channels. In this respect, they are comparable to the quartz‑carbonates mega-shear zones found in other granulite terranes. Depending on the redox conditions, mantle CO 2 and brines may either result in the formation of graphite or quartz‑carbonate veins.Download Free PDFView PDFField geology of high-grade gneiss terrains1990 • Cees PasschierDownload Free PDFView PDFGeochimica et Cosmochimica ActaGoldschmidt Abstracts 2008- V2008 • Pier Paolo GiacomoniDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
