Everyone assumed he was kidnapped. The truth is worse - he ran away and found the life he always dreamed of.Now, at seventeen, he’s Sean Woodhouse. And he’s come “home”, to the last place he wants to ever be, to claim the small inheritance his grandparents promised him when he graduated high school, all so he can save Trip, the boy he developed an intense and complicated relationship with while he was away.Sean has changed, but so has his old town and everyone in it. And knowing who he is and where he belongs is more confusing than ever. As his careful plans begin to crumble, so does everything he’s believed about his idyllic other life.Read moreSkip carouselCarousel PreviousCarousel NextRomanceComing of AgeFamilyLanguageEnglishPublisherHelene Dunbar AudioRelease dateDec 30, 2021ISBN9781669615224Start your free  daysPlay sampleSave for laterDownload to appShareShare titleRelated to BoomerangRelated audiobooksSkip carouselCarousel PreviousCarousel NextThe Mayor of Oak StreetAudiobookThe Mayor of Oak StreetbyVincent Traughber MeisRating: 0 out of 5 stars0 ratingsSave The Mayor of Oak Street for laterSkyler PhoenixAudiobookSkyler PhoenixbyDamien Benoit-LedouxRating: 0 out of 5 stars0 ratingsSave Skyler Phoenix for laterDestination UnknownAudiobookDestination UnknownbyBill KonigsbergRating: 5 out of 5 stars5/5Save Destination Unknown for laterFraternityAudiobookFraternitybyAndy MientusRating: 4 out of 5 stars4/5Save Fraternity for laterFire SongAudiobookFire SongbyAdam Garnet JonesRating: 3 out of 5 stars3/5Save Fire Song for laterThe Rules and Regulations of Mediating Myths & MagicAudiobookThe Rules and Regulations of Mediating Myths & MagicbyF LukensRating: 4 out of 5 stars4/5Save The Rules and Regulations of Mediating Myths & Magic for laterQuest of AwakeningAudiobookQuest of AwakeningbyDaniel DicksonRating: 0 out of 5 stars0 ratingsSave Quest of Awakening for laterThe Days of Bluegrass LoveAudiobookThe Days of Bluegrass LovebyEdward Van De VendelRating: 3 out of 5 stars3/5Save The Days of Bluegrass Love for laterIn the Key of DaleAudiobookIn the Key of DalebyBenjamin LefebvreRating: 4 out of 5 stars4/5Save In the Key of Dale for laterThe Great American WhateverAudiobookThe Great American WhateverbyFindawayRating: 3 out of 5 stars3/5Save The Great American Whatever for laterRetributionAudiobookRetributionbyDani HootsRating: 0 out of 5 stars0 ratingsSave Retribution for laterAnything But FineAudiobookAnything But FinebyTobias MaddenRating: 4 out of 5 stars4/5Save Anything But Fine for laterStupid Boy Syndrome: 28 Poems on Love, Lust and LossAudiobookStupid Boy Syndrome: 28 Poems on Love, Lust and LossbyDylan DrakesRating: 3 out of 5 stars3/5Save Stupid Boy Syndrome: 28 Poems on Love, Lust and Loss for laterHowlAudiobookHowlbyShaun David HutchinsonRating: 4 out of 5 stars4/5Save Howl for laterWe are Lost and FoundAudiobookWe are Lost and FoundbyHelene DunbarRating: 4 out of 5 stars4/5Save We are Lost and Found for laterJust AshAudiobookJust AshbySol SantanaRating: 5 out of 5 stars5/5Save Just Ash for laterMiles Away from YouAudiobookMiles Away from YoubyA.B.
