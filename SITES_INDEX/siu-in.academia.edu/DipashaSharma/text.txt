This study is focused to evaluate the post-acquisition operating performance of listed Indian companies (acquirers) which have made acquisitions during subprime crisis period i.e. from FY 2007-08 to FY 2009-10. Paired sample t-test has been used on four operating performance indicators i.e. Return on Equity(ROE), Return on Assets (ROA), Operating Profit margin (OPM) and Operating Cash flow to Net Sales ratio (OCF/Net Sales) to check whether operating performance of acquirers has significantly improved post-acquisition. This study has revealed that there is no significant improvement in firms’ operating performance based on financial parameters i.e. Return on Equity (ROE), Return on Assets (ROA) and Operating Profit Margin (OPM), post corporate acquisitions made during subprime crisis period.

However, the impact of the ESG–CFP relationship varies across economies, industries, and institutional frameworks due to varying legal, social structures and expectations from stakeholders. The present study aims to test the bidirectional causality and autoregression effects between ESG disclosures and the firm value of Indian energy sector companies’ data using a four-wave cross-lagged panel structural equation modeling. Results indicate that the relationship is not bidirectional in the overall and individual elementsof ESG to firm value. We find AR effects to be stable, and there is a negative association found in the first two lags and a positive association found in the last lag. Research findings are beneficial for investors, fund managers, policymakers, and energy company managers. We further provide direction to executives on ESG investment and practices and lag period to reap the benefit of such investments through firm value.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In the famous paper by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, it is posited that Black Swan events cannot be reliably predicted, and it is instead important to be prepared for them at all times (Musgrave, 2009). This study aims to understand various Black Swan events in recent history from the point of view of equity markets, and performs a comparative study between different events across time and geography in order to understand if there are any standard early indicators. In this study, a total of seven global events have been observed within the selected period from FY 1997 to FY 2019. All events have been considered from the standpoint of their impact on S&P 500 index. Apart from assessing the sensitivity factor, the impact of each event was observed for any statistical similarity through a One-Way ANOVA test of their normalised values.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Although abundant research on the association of emerging dimensions of stock performance with bank efficiency is available for the developed countries, such research in developing economies is limited. In the light of this, a model is constructed with stock market return as the principal variable along with bank efficiency and bank-specific factors and tested for the Indian economy. The model was developed using data envelopment analysis (DEA) for Indian banks. Panel data regression analysis was used to examine the empirical association between efficiency measures and market performance measures. The regression results confirmed the presence of a statistically significant association between operational efficiency and market performance of Indian banks. Operationally efficient banks create more value and returns to their investors and are thus found to be effective.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
