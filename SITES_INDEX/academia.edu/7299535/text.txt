Teachers’ decisions to use ICT in classroom practice: An investigation based on Decomposed Theory of Planned Behavior. Athanassios  Jimoyiannis2012, International Journal of Digital Literacy and Digital Competence, 3(2), 20-37This paper reports on a pilot study investigating Greek secondary education teachers' perceptions and attitudes towards current use of ICT as a learning tool in their classroom practice and the possible factors that influence their decisions to integrate ICT in their instruction. The survey presented has adopted the Decomposed Theory of Planned Behavior (DTPB) with certain modifications a) to assess teachers' beliefs of the potential of ICT to support classroom learning activities, and b) to better understand teachers' decisions to adopt ICT as learning tool in classroom practice. A Likert-type scale was constructed to investigate the DTPB variables and other factors related to the use of ICT in the classroom. Results indicated that although teachers were aware of the benefits of ICT to promote students' learning they do not integrate ICT as a learning tool in their regular, everyday teaching practices. Primary factors determining the use of ICT in classroom practice relate to...See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersInternational Journal of Digital Literacy and Digital CompetenceJimoyiannis A. & Gravani M.

The schools involved in the project were:  Lockleys North Primary School  Ferryden Park Primary school  Streaky Bay Area School  Glenunga International High School The research was commissioned by the Learning Technologies group of DECS to understand and document changes that occurred as the project schools focussed on the use of learning technologies to support the learning of their teachers and studentsDownload Free PDFView PDFInternational Journal of Digital Literacy and Digital CompetenceRoussinos D. & Jimoyiannis A.

Also, this study examines the impact of using technology on the science learning process, the students' interaction with their teacher and colleagues, their concentration, and participation in the class. To collect data on self-evaluation, this study used qualitative and quantitative methods which helped eleven science teachers to rate their self-efficacy, knowledge, and attitudes. Consequently, measurements of teachers' attitudes with using computer technology by means of open and closed ended questionnaires and The Computer Technology Integration Survey (CTIS) took place in 2014-2015 academic year. Also, special needs students' performance results were collected pre-and post ICT training. This study identified possible influences on self-efficacy beliefs, perceived usefulness of computer technology, and ratings of self-efficacy beliefs toward technology integration. Findings of this study revealed that teachers' self-efficacy in the level of technology use, and attitudes have significant effects on the grades and interaction of students with special needs. The results indicated that participants of group one, who were trained, were able to better define and apply technology in the science classroom than group two which was not being trained. The findings suggest that knowledge and beliefs can influence teachers' intent to use technology in the classroom, especially as evidenced by the integration of ICT in their lesson plans. Moreover, results indicate a significant positive Pearson correlation r=.6 between teachers' self-efficacy, knowledge,Download Free PDFView PDFInformation literacy through resource-based learning: Malaysian teachers' conception and instructional practicesMALAYSIAN JOURNAL OF  LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCEThis paper examines how secondary school teachers in Malaysia conceptualize information literacy, and how this understanding leads to information literacy practices through resource-based learning. Although there have been studies carried out in this area, most of the studies are conducted in western societies with sound exposure to information literacy. This study takes place in a learning environment where information literacy is not a central focus in the school curriculum. It employs a qualitative approach in the form of a case study. Five history subject teachers supervising resource-based learning history project took part in the study. Data were collected through a series of interviews with the teacher participants to uncover: (a) their conceptions of information literacy; (b) their teaching focus in the project instruction; and (c) the instructional approach employed. Six information literacy conceptions, six information literacy teaching focuses, and four types of information literacy instructional methods are generated from the study. The findings suggest that the teachers' conceptions of information literacy in Malaysia are quite comparable to those from developed countries. However, the outlooks are more superficial and lack richness and depth. Further findings show that these conceptions influence and shape teachers' information literacy teaching focuses, as well as their project instructional approaches.Download Free PDFView PDFThe 2013 ICT Census in Schools: Summary ReportGerry ShielThis report summarises findings from the 2013 ICT Census in primary, post-primary and special schools in Ireland.Download Free PDFView PDFA Needs Analysis for Technology Integration Plan: Challenges and Needs of TeachersSinemis Vatanartiran, Sirin KaradenizLack of technology leadership and technology integration plans are important obstacles for using technology effectively in schools. We carried out a large-scale study to be able to design a technology integration plan for one of the pilot provinces that Fatih Project was initiated. The purpose of this research is to examine the perceived challenges and needs of K12 teachers when integrating technology into their classes, which would be used as the needs analysis data of the technology integration plan. A mixed design was used and 844 teachers participated in the study. An online survey was used to gather both the quantitative and qualitative data. The findings showed that there are three major issues for teachers to integrate technology into their instruction: Executive, infrastructural, and instructional. Executive issues are mostly related to managerial and financial challenges, Infrastructural issues include technological and physical challenges, and instructional issues consist of challenges related with instructional materials, students' readiness, and teacher competencies.Download Free PDFView PDFBritish Journal of Educational TechnologyTowards a differentiated and domain-specific view of educational technology: An exploratory study of history teachers' technology use.2017 • Michiel Voet, Bram  De WeverAdopting a differentiated and domain-specific view of educational technology, the present study focusses on the case of school history. It argues that, in this particular context, one of technology’s main assets is its ability to support inquiry-based learning activities, during which students interpret the past through historical reasoning. As little is known about how history teachers use technology in the classroom, an exploratory study was carried out with 22 teachers in fourth grade of secondary education in Flanders (Belgium). Semi-structured interviews were used to investigate beliefs about technology, ways in which technology was implemented, and factors influencing the adoption process. The results suggest that most teachers held positive beliefs about technology, and that use of technology was driven by several rationales. Although a significant group of teachers was thoughtful of how their own use of technology could support students’ learning, student use remained limited to instances where technology served as a resource for the task, rather than a tool for supporting cognitive or social activity. It appears that teachers were not yet aware of technology’s ability to scaffold inquiry activities. Furthermore, limitations in school infrastructure often prevented them from experimenting with more pervasive student uses of technology.Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
