Fourteen qualitative, semi-structured interviews were conducted with arts festival organisers, tourism representatives and local volunteers during the summer festival season. The findings offer new insights into the factors affecting how arts festivals impact the local economy; the areas of the local economy that are affected by arts festivals; and the implications of funding from awarding bodies on the endogenous development of arts festivals. For instance, it is concluded that supporting the cultural values of locals is vital to the economic success of rural arts festivals through a strategic design in the combined integration of minimised paid staff and maximised volunteers. Furthermore, it is revealed how in certain cases the initial retention of funding may benefit start-up arts festivals in terms of strategic development of their...Save to Libraryby Jordan R Gamble•  20  Festivals and music, Island Studies, Event Management, Case Study ResearchLean Six Sigma Executive Overview (Case Study) TemplatesABSTRACT Lean Six Sigma Executive Overview (Case Study) Templates are a guide to Lean Six Sigma Green Belt, Lean Six Sigma Black Belt, and Lean Six Sigma Master Black Belt Projects.

Most recently is its adoption for the design and management of low carbon buildings. The purpose of this research paper is to identify the most found benefits with this practice and evaluate how BIM can help reduce the carbon output of buildings. Case studies from across the UK found through a number of literature sources have been used in the study. A two stage assessment model has been created in which positive BIM benefits and incorporated environmental features from each case are scored to produce the results. The most commonly identified benefit was quality which coincides with the development of a low carbon building having to have assurance and control of the building performance and an overall excellent finish quality. The outcome of the research found that BIM plays a key role in aiding the development of low carbon buildings yet further study is required as a few factors in the method influenced the results.Save to LibraryDownloadby Steven Moffat•  5  Case Study Research, Sustainable Building Design, Building Information Modeling, Passive House DesignHands-on or hands-off: effective leadership and management in SMEs in collaboration with Championing better work and working livesSave to LibraryDownloadby Louise Suckley•  6  Business, Leadership, Case Study Research, Human Resource ManagementCase Studies and Comparative Methods for Qualitative ResearchThis course focuses on how to design and conduct small-n case study and comparative research.

Thinking outside of students' areas of interest and specialisms and topics, students will be encouraged to develop the concepts and comparative frameworks that underpin these phenomena. In other words, students will begin to develop their research topics as cases of something. The course covers questions of design and methods of case study research, from single-n to small-n case studies including discussions of process tracing and Mill's methods. The course addresses both the theoretical and methodological discussions that underpin research design as well as the practical questions of how to conduct case study research, including gathering, assessing and using evidence. Examples from the fields of comparative politics, IR, development studies, sociology and European studies will be used throughout the lectures and seminars.Save to LibraryDownloadby Eleanor Knott•  3  Case Study Research, Comparative Methods, Case StudyAbout Matching Dell Case Analysis.docxDell computers from the very start were selling customized personal computers.

This dissertation posits the idea that educational institutions reproduce social exclusions and inequalities both through verbal exchanges and through practices of looking; it aims to apply some theoretical frameworks from the field of visual studies to the study of discourse and subjectivity in the context of higher education. The first part of this dissertation summarizes some of the general currents within the field of sociology of education on the study of the “hidden curriculum,” and, drawing on Foucault’s understanding of disciplinary power, proposes a theoretical approach based in three axes of analysis – i.e., the technical capacities, the systems of communication, and the relationships of power. Following this approach, the second part of this dissertation presents a case study at the University of Guelph. Autoethnographic methods, visual methodologies and qualitative interviews are combined to collect data that are examined according to the defined axes of analysis. Different pedagogical approaches that draw from art education and critical theory are offered to address the non-verbal processes identified within each axis of analysis: “invisible pedagogies” deal with the discursive aspects of the pedagogical settings; “pedagogies of touch” address the role of affect and the body in the reproduction of discourse; and “performative pedagogies” are used to address power relations and to allow for multiple subject-positions in the student-teacher relationship. All of these approaches draw on concepts currently being used in curriculum studies, the aim of this dissertation being to contribute to the development of critical perspectives in relation to the role of the visual in educational research.Save to LibraryDownloadby Alejandro Santaflorentina•  11  Visual Studies, Sociology of Education, Higher Education, Visual CultureCASE STUDY of SG COWEN.docx•INTERVENING ABOUT OFFER, ATTENTION AND KNOWLEDGE OF CANDIDATES However, it is a just general approach to view HRM processes of the company.

Furthermore, I had the chance to analyze the method used by the frontistirio teachers and in what ways this method helps or negatively influences children regarding their performance in the four basic skills. We will evaluate the evidence acquired by the girl by studying briefly the basic theories provided by important figures in the field of L2.  Finally, I will also include my personal suggestions and the improvement of the child’s abilities and I will state my opinion clearly.Keywords:  case study, children, Greece, second language acquisition, skills.Save to LibraryDownloadby Violetta-Irene  Koutsompou, MBPsS•Case Study ResearchMcDonalds Case StudyIn this paper we worked on the case study on Mcdonalds marketing case study which is in marketing management........Save to LibraryDownloadby Tonmoy Dash and +3Md.

Defensive information battlespace knowledge can be provided by detailed analysis of carefully selected metrics using automated analysis, data mining, and data calls. Gathering data for metrics involves many of the same pitfalls as collecting data in research but also incurs the intra-organizational communication problems inherent in organizations. These factors make it difficult to turn data and metrics into decision-ready knowledge.

It has been speculated that linguistic system in bilingual aphasics can breakdown in different ways across languages. There is a lack of detailed linguistic studies in specific aspects of bilingual aphasia in Indian context. The present study highlights linguistic investigations across languages in bilingual aphasics. Measures like spontaneous speech analysis, paraphasia checklist and paradigmatic distance could help in determining languages for therapy even though such decisions cannot be effectively carried out only by traditional test like Western aphasia battery. It is thus suggested that linguistic analysis form a part of routine aphasia evaluation and more subtypes be profiled in a similar way.

International contract-making is regarded as an element of cross-cultural collaboration, which inevitably reveals the cultural background of the parties. The article is based on a case study of three international companies conducting business inRussia. To comprehend the empirical material critically, the analysis applies concepts relating to cross-cultural collaboration and experiences of contracting in the sociological and anthropological literature. The ambiguities in the practice of contracting, which is rigid in form but flexible in execution,allow us to better understand the role of the codified and informalrules regulating business in contemporary Russia.Save to LibraryDownloadby Elena  Bogdanova•  6  Contracts, International Business, Cross-border cooperation, Case Study ResearchBuyer�supplier collaborative relationships: Beyond the normative accountsSave to LibraryDownloadby John  Storey•  7  Marketing, Supply Chain Management, Relationship Marketing, Case Study ResearchLiberating People from Psychiatric Diagnoses 2: Exploring Severe Mental, Behavioral, and Emotional Disturbances Through Case StudyThe second article in a series, this case study demonstrates how psychiatric diagnoses and treatment can ignore social, environmental, and personal history factors that likely caused a person's mental disorders.

We examined the life of a woman who endured physical assault and rape by her father, a series of unsatisfactory romantic relationships, marriage to a man who repeatedly brutalized their children and her, the deaths of two children, and the burden of caring for eight surviving offspring. This woman occasionally exhibited symptoms of depression and emotional outbursts that led to her psychiatric hospitalization, psychotropic drugging, and ECT. Hospitalization and psychiatric drugs provided no relief, while ECT brought on memory impairment, difficulty concentrating, and bizarre persecutory beliefs. This case study revealed how psychiatric diagnosis and treatment can be irrelevant, ineffective, and harmful, while concealing institutional failures and helping to perpetuate social problems.Save to LibraryDownloadby Stephen E.

Mediante el diseño y aplicación de un número reducido, pero clave de entrevistas personales, efectuadas a personas cuya posición genera un contacto constante con los clientes de la organización y a una investigación personal basada en la indagación, observación y búsqueda en la web, se logró recabar información valiosa que refleja tanto el panorama actual como las fortalezas y desafíos que exhibe la empresa a futuro en torno a este campo. Con base en ello se determinó que la compañía posee medios y activos con los cuales podría potenciar sus comunicaciones, pero así mismo, que sin desarrollar ninguna clase de acciones de este tipo, debido a la ausencia de personal y en sí mismo a un departamento de marketing, ha obtenido resultados sobresalientes y sostenidos durante los últimos años.Save to LibraryDownloadby Jose Manuel Villamarín-García•  6  Industrial Relations, Case Study Research, IT in healthcare, Marketing CommunicationsFormal Development of a Cardiac Pacemaker: from Specification to Code"This paper presents a formal development of a cardiac pacing system based on a Boston Scientific’s model, a pilot case study from the Grand Challenge in Software Verification.

The article describes the key processes of undertaking participant observation involving joining members of a social group, learning how to participate, and undertake fieldwork. Methodological issues such as validity, generalisation and representations are discussed in relation to the collection and analysis of data. Participant observation whether open or covert is seen to involve a continuous reflection on ethical issues and contributes to the inclusion of the voices of those who are marginalised or rendered invisible in public debates.Save to Libraryby John  Schostak•  20  Discourse Analysis, Gender Studies, Cultural Sociology, Action ResearchThe role of the public health nurse in meeting the primary health care needs of single homeless people: a case study reportSave to LibraryDownloadby Sinead Keeney•  7  Primary Health Care, Case Study Research, Public Health, Case StudyA estratégia de estudos de caso e a prática da generalização: uma discussão sobre pesquisa e fazer ciênciaTentando refletir criticamente sobre a natureza da abordagem qualitativa e os estudos de caso como estratégia particular, o presente trabalho procura analisar as práticas científicas no campo sociológico.

The rotary joint thus allows the air to flow through itself along with providing the rotary motion of the wheel assembly. Thus the rotary joint makes it possible work out the idea. A compressor is used which gets its power supply from the battery. When the pressure falls below desired level the compressor pumps air through the rotary union to the Tyre and inflates it.Save to LibraryDownloadby Novel Sahu•  3  Case Study Research, Case Study, Business case studyA Survey Report on Evolution of Machine TranslationSave to LibraryDownloadby Sreelekha  S•  7  Machine Learning, Machine Translation, Case Study Research, Statistical Machine TranslationRethinking FQoL: The Dynamic Interplay Between Individual and Family Quality of LifeFamily quality of life (FQoL) is an emerging concept to understand and improve the well-being and quality of life (QoL) of families.

While there has been a lot of effort to conceptualize life domains of families and measurement tools are devised, few studies concentrate on an in-depth understanding of FQoL. The specific aim of the current study is to understand the relation between individual QoL and FQoL, by studying families with a child/children with intellectual and developmental disabilities (ID/DD) in the Nether-lands. This can contribute to a stable foundation of the concept of FQoL. Methods: An explorative case study design was used, in which the parents, sibling, and child with ID voiced their thoughts on their FQoL.

Originally from India, this Urdu‐speaking community was effectively stranded, and lived in refugee camps for the next 37 years, systematically denied citizen status and basic services. In 2001, Biharis started to get organised to demand recognition from the governments of Bangladesh and Pakistan. A landmark High Court ruling in 2003 awarded 10 refugee camp dwellers Bangladeshi citizenship and inclusion on the electoral roll. ActionAid Bangladesh consequently worked with local partner SPYRM, who successfully petitioned the High Court for the same rights for all 300,000 Bihari people still living in 116 refugee camps across the country. Following a series of conferences and seminars to raise awareness of the Bihari's plight, and the surrounding media attention, the government finally reviewed their case and on 18 May 2008 the High Court ruled in the Bihari people's favour. Finally, after 37 years in the wilderness, members of the Bihari community were able to cast their first vote in the 2009 Bangladesh national parliamentary election.Save to LibraryDownloadby Subhagya Mangal Chakma•Case Study ResearchBefore constitution-making: the struggle for constitution-making design in post-revolutionary EgyptScholars have recently become attentive not only to the institutional designs that constitutions set up, but also to the constitutional change processes.

Most authors, who are concerned with the effects the design of constitution-making processes have on outcomes, have focused on the main constitution-making bodies and their characteristics, leaving aside the question of what happens before members of constituent assemblies meet to deliberate. This article makes the point that to better understand constitution-making and its outcomes, we need to take into account the overlooked early stage of constitutional change when political actors debate and set the rules for how a constitution will be made. Building on various political science perspectives and the case study of the 2011–2012 constitutional reform in Egypt, it underscores the inevitably contentious nature of the design of a constitution-making process. It also highlights the impact that unresolved conflicts over the design can have for the agreement on a constitution between political opponents in the context of a democratic transition. In Egypt, adoption of a broadly accepted constitution was hindered by on-going struggles between Islamists and non-Islamists over their preferred constitution-making designs. The article also outlines the factors that make the settlement on constitution-making rules unlikely.Save to LibraryDownloadby Tereza  Jermanová•  10  Qualitative methodology, Case Study Research, Democratization, EgyptThe international expansion process of MNEs from developing countries: a case study of Thailand's CP GroupSave to LibraryDownloadby Carl  Zeithaml and +1Pavida Pananond•  8  Marketing, Case Study Research, Third World, Developing CountryDeveloping and Leading Emergence TeamsDeveloping and Leading Emergence Teams describes a future business landscape that seems to be complicated, complex and chaotic, in almost equal measures.

The variety and diversity of the environments within which large organizations will be seeking to operate, require a similar variety of systems, process and structures if they are to respond successfully to emerging opportunities. The established models of teamworking (matrix, cross-functional or transdisciplinary) can all adapt to this new environment but will only do so if the culture, leadership and management style of the business enables this. The authors describe a model of emergence teams; high-trust teams that exhibit exceptional affinity for knowledge sharing, sense making, and consensus building. They then explore the specifics of leading such a team, how the team leader should: design the team; interact and facilitate the team’s development; understand the personal nature of each of the team members and the overall emotional regime that will affect trust, commitment and motivation.

They are responsible particularly for supporting local development through financing projects aimed at improving quality of life in local environment. To be successful communes first of all need to introduce a strategic approach in managementprocess. Strategy helps to accumulate limited funds around the main expectations of local communities and opens new perspectives for additional financial support. But it is only half of the success to develop a good strategy. Equally important is the implementation process, in which long term objectives defined in a strategy are transformed into activities undertaken by local authorities in a yearly prepared budget. This article describesmain experiences of local strategy usage in management process of communities on the example of Bolesławiec.Save to LibraryDownloadby Jaroslaw Ignacy•  10  Public Administration, Public Management, Case Study Research, Strategic ManagementRethinking Case Study ResearchComparative case studies are an effective qualitative tool for researching the impact of policy and practice in various fields of social research, including education.

Developed in response to the inadequacy of traditional case study approaches, comparative case studies are highly effective because of their ability to synthesize information across time and space. In Rethinking Case Study Research: A Comparative Approach, the authors describe, explain, and illustrate the horizontal, vertical, and transversal axes of comparative case studies in order to help readers develop their own comparative case study research designs. In six concise chapters, two experts employ geographically distinct case studies―from Tanzania to Guatemala to the U.S.―to show how this innovative approach applies to the operation of policy and practice across multiple social fields. With examples and activities from anthropology, development studies, and policy studies, this volume is written for researchers, especially graduate students, in the fields of education and the interpretive social sciences.Save to LibraryDownloadby Frances Vavrus and +1Lesley  Bartlett•  7  Qualitative methodology, Case Study Research, Qualitative Research, Qualitative Research MethodsManagement development and the supply chain manager of the futureSave to LibraryDownloadby Martin Christopher•  14  Supply Chain Management, Case Study Research, Logistics, Supply ChainThe diary method and analysis of student's mental representations of information spaces as the research approach in information behaviour researchIntroduction.

This paper focuses on a research strategy combining the concept of mental models, diary method, drawings technique and thematic analysis to study individual information spaces. The possibility of implementing such approach was tested on a case study of personal information spaces of undergraduate information management students. Method. Methods of critical literature review and case study were used. Empirical data were gathered by means of the diary technique in its verbal, written and open form and by participant-generated drawings, and analysed with thematic analysis. Analysis. The analysis allowed to: (1) elicit selected components of individual information spaces as represented in their mental models, such as information activities, sources, people, places, affective and socio-cultural factors, and (2) to capture the main features of mental models, i.e. themes (cross-data patterns). Results. The pursuit of positive emotions, comfort, peace and safety is the dominant force shaping information behaviour and personalized information spaces. Conclusions. Triangulation of concepts of mental models, diary method, drawings technique and thematic analysis proved to be a fruitful study approach, not only offering holistic insight into personal information spaces but also opening new research questions.Save to LibraryDownloadby Monika Krakowska and +1Sabina Cisek•  9  Case Study Research, Qualitative Research, Diary Studies, Thematic AnalysisMaking a living: Grassroots development initiatives, natural resource management and institutional support in Galicia, SpainEuropean policy increasingly supports territorially based rural development in which local actors play a decisive role in realising economically, socially and ecologically responsible development.

This paper makes use of four case-studies, from a largelydepopulated mountainous area in Galicia, Spain, where local people strive to combine the creation of new businesses with the revitalisation of the natural resource base. The paper, in analysing local knowledge infrastructure and its interface with policy, reveals the dominant role of grassroots development initiatives in effecting regional learning and capacity building. Further it is acknowledged that in Galicia progress is brokered in practice by individual stakeholders who manage structural constraints, cross boundaries and construct new cross-cutting, bridging networks. It is also apparent that these niche-actors constitute a largely untapped reservoir of knowledge brokers that could be used much more effectively if more direct cooperation with policymakers and the existing knowledge infrastructure could be achieved.Save to LibraryDownloadby Paul Swagemakers and +1Xavier Simón Fernández•  2  Case Study Research, Rural DevelopmentNextLast »Related TopicsQualitative MethodsFollowFollowingQualitative methodologyFollowFollowingGrounded Theory (Research Methodology)FollowFollowingMixed MethodsFollowFollowingResearch MethodologyFollowFollowingAction ResearchFollowFollowingResearch DesignFollowFollowingQualitative ResearchFollowFollowingEthnography (Research Methodology)FollowFollowingSocial Research Methods and MethodologyFollowFollowing 71.6 million researchers use this site every month.
