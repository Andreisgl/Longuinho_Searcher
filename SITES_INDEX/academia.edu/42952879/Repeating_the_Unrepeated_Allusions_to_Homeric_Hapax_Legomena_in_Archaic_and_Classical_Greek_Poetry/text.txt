Beck (ed.) Repetition, Communication, and Meaning in the Ancient World (Orality and Literacy XIII, Mnemosyne Suppl. 442), Leiden (Brill), 2021, pp. 119-157In this paper, I investigate the repetition of Homeric hapax legomena in archaic and classical Greek poetry. Scholars frequently assume that fine-grained engagement with Homeric rarities is a distinctive feature of the Hellenistic period, but I reveal the significant precedent for this phenomenon in earlier poetry. Proceeding through comedy, tragedy and lyric, I explore a range of case studies which demonstrate the extremely sophisticated appropriation of Homeric unica in the pre-Hellenistic world. I argue that this evidence requires us to reconsider the extent of allusion in archaic and classical Greece and to rewrite traditional narratives of literary history.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersM.A. Harder, R.F.

Leuven (Peeters): 225-271.The Shadow of Aristophanes: Hellenistic Poetry’s Reception of Comic PoeticsThomas J NelsonThe significance and influence of Attic drama on Hellenistic poetry has been a topic of little consistent focus in recent scholarship, reflecting the dominant academic emphasis on Hellenistic poetry as a written artefact, allegedly detached from any immediate context of performance. This paper attempts to reverse this trend by setting out the continuing vitality and cultural importance of drama in the Hellenistic world, before exploring the role of Attic Old Comedy as both a precedent and a model for Hellenistic poetry. Much of what is often thought distinctively ‘Hellenistic’ can in fact be shown to have clear old comic precedent: Old Comedy, just like Hellenistic poetry, is heavily intertextual (even to the point of re-appropriating Homeric hapax legomena); engages in frequent generic manipulation; displays a strong interest in literary history; emphasises its own literary and metrical innovations; and displays a self-conscious awareness of the tensions between textuality and performance. Yet more than this, Old Comedy also offered a key paradigm of agonistic self-fashioning and literary-critical terminology which Hellenistic poets could parrot, appropriate and invert. Hellenistic poets’ direct engagement with Old Comedy extended well beyond the famous literary agon of Aristophanes’ Frogs.Download Free PDFView PDFGreek Memories: Theories and PracticesEconomies of Memory in Greek Tragedy, in L.

After surveying the ancient association of elegy and lament (Section I) and the common metapoetic function of birds from Homer onwards (Section II), I analyse Hellenistic and Roman examples where the nightingale (Section III) and swan (Section IV) emerge as symbols of elegiac poetics. The legends associated with both birds rendered them natural models of lamentation. But besides this thematic association, I consider the ancient terms used to describe their song, especially its shrillness (λιγυρότης/liquiditas) and sweetness (γλυκύτης/dulcedo) (Section V). I demonstrate how these two terms connect birdsong, lament and elegiac poetry in a tightly packed nexus. These birds proved perfect emblems of elegy not only in their constant lamentation, but also in the very sound and nature of their song.Download Free PDFView PDFM. Perale, J. Kwapisz, G. Taietti & B. Cartlidge (eds.) Hellenistic Poetry Before Callimachus. Cambridge (CUP)Early Hellenistic EpicThomas J NelsonLittle survives of Early Hellenistic Epic, so much so that different scholars have come to opposite conclusions about its significance: for Konrad Ziegler, it was once widespread and plentiful; but for Alan Cameron, it was practically non-existent. The truth of the matter almost certainly lies somewhere between these two extremes. But in this contribution, rather than re-tracing this debate, I analyse the fragmentary scraps and testimonia of early Hellenistic epic from a literary perspective. I explore to what extent these poems appear to have foreshadowed the work of Callimachus and other later Hellenistic poets, especially in their engagement with Homeric scholarship and their treatment of myth (with a particular focus on metamorphosis, aetiology and unheroic, erotic narratives). Many features which we consider distinctively Callimachean are in fact, I argue, already well-established in these early epics, highlighting the broader continuities of Hellenistic literary culture. However, given that many of these same features are also visible centuries earlier in the epics of Homer and the Epic Cycle, I conclude by reassessing how distinctive our criteria for describing 'Hellenistic' or 'Callimachean' poetics actually are.Download Free PDFView PDFGreek memories: Theories and PracticesIntroduction, in L.
