It traces the development of Nietzsche’s thought in order to expose how nihilism came to be Nietzsche’ central concern. Then it examines the vexing question of what exactly Nietzsche takes to be the core of nihilism. Sometimes Nietzsche treats nihilism as a belief; at other times he seems to treat it as an affective disorder.  Similarly, regarding Nietzsche’s notion of the affirmation of life, his antidote to nihilism.  It remains unclear whether this is a matter of adopting some cognitive attitude, for instance affirming the eternal recurrence of life, or, of adopting a form of life that does not involve the repression of our fundamental drives.  Throughout the paper the question of Nietzsche’s attitude to the relation between myth, nihilism and affirmation is examined.  This sheds light on both his relationship to Wagner and the ambition behind his Thus spoke Zarathustra, the work he took to be his most important.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Often overshadowed by twentieth century philosophy which sought to reject some of its central tenets, the philosophers of the nineteenth century have re-emerged as profoundly important figures. The Routledge Companion to Nineteenth Century Philosophy is an outstanding survey and assessment of the century as a whole. Divided into seven parts and including thirty chapters written by leading international scholars, the Companion examines and assesses the central topics, themes, and philosophers of the nineteenth century, presenting the first comprehensive picture of the period in a single volume: * German Idealism * Philosophy as political action, including young Hegelians, Marx and Tocqueville * Philosophy and subjectivity, including Schopenhauer, Kierkegaard and Nietzsche * Scientific naturalism, including Darwinism, philosophy...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This suggests that the recent trend of analysing Nietzsche through the prism of his relationship to Schopenhauer should be tempered by a perspective that gives more emphasis to his relationship with Wagner; it is from Wagner, more than Schopenhauer, that Nietzsche takes the theme that the problem of meaninglessness is THE problem of modernity. Another central claim of this paper is that the very values Nietzsche seems to promote as secular replacements for previous meaning-giving religious values, namely culture and the cultivation of great individuals or genius, are by the lights of Nietzsche’s BT already recognized as illusions.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

On the Leibnizian account God does not have wordly existence, and possible world actualism is rejected. Further, it is briefly argued that orthodox possible world actualism is itself incompatible with God’s perfection.Working paperSave to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Experts in ethics, epistemology, philosophy of mind, political theory, aesthetics, history, critical theory, and hermeneutics bring to light the best philosophical scholarship what is arguably Friedrich Nietzsche&#39;s most rewarding but most challenging text. Including essays that were commissioned specifically for the volume as well as essays revised and edited by their authors, this collection showcases definitive works that have shaped Nietzsche studies alongside new works of interest to students and experts alike. Sections are devoted to the topic of genealogy generally, numerous essays on specific passages, applications of genealogy in later thinkers, and the import of Nietzsche&#39;s Genealogy in contemporary politics, ethics, and aesthetics.

Carnap-Confirmation, Content-Cutting, & Real ConfirmationThe attempt to explicate the intuitive notions of confirmation and inductive support through use ... more The attempt to explicate the intuitive notions of confirmation and inductive support through use of the formal calculus of probability received its canonical formulation in Carnap&#39;s The Logical Foundations of Probability. It is a central part of modern Bayesianism as developed recently, for instance, by Paul Horwich and John Earman. Carnap places much emphasis on the identification of confirmation with the notion of probabilistic favorable relevance. Notoriously, the notion of confirmation as probabilistic favorable relevance violates the intuitive transmittability condition that if e confirms h and h&#39; is part of the content of h then e confirms h&#39;. This suggests that, pace Carnap, it cannot capture our intuitive notions of confirmation and inductive support. Without transmittability confirmation losses much of its intrinsic interest. If e, say a report of past observations, can confirm h, say a law-like generalization, without that confirmation being transmitted to thos...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

This is central to the positivists’ core project of demarcating science from metaphysics/the non-cognitively significant/ nonsense. After reviewing various reasons why the quest for a demarcation criterion has long been abandoned, it is argued that none of the traditional objections are compelling. In particular, it is shown that holism, the most widely cited ground for dismissing the possibility of a demarcation criterion, is perfectly compatible with a criterion of empirical significance. What is needed is an account that explains how a claim can be empirically significant within a given theory. It is shown that new research in logic; in particular the account of content developed in Gemes (1994) and (1996) provides machinery that solves the longstanding technical problems faced by Positivists’ attempts to formulate a holistic account of empirical significance.ArticleSave to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It is the perceived failure of H-D to solve such problems that has lead John Earman to recently conclude that H-D is &quot;very nearly a dead horse&quot;. This suggests the following state of play: H-D is an intuitively plausible idea that breaks down in the attempt to give it a precise formulation. Indeed I think that fairly captures the view among specialists in the field of confirmation theory. Here I argue that the truth about H-D is largely the reverse: H-D can be given a precise formulation that avoids the longstanding technical problems, however, it relies on a fundamentally unsound philosophical intuition. The bulk of this paper involves reviewing the problems affecting previous attempts at giving precise formulations of H-D and displaying som...Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
A Better Self: Freud and Nietzsche on the Nature and Value of SublimationThe Oxford Handbook of Philosophy and Psychoanalysis,  2018The notion of sublimation is essential to Nietzsche and Freud. However, Freud’s writings fail to ... more The notion of sublimation is essential to Nietzsche and Freud. However, Freud’s writings fail to provide a persuasive notion of sublimation. In particular, Freud’s writings are confused on the distinction between pathological symptoms and sublimations, and on the relation between sublimation and repression. After rehearsing these problems in some detail it is proposed that a return to Nietzsche allows for a more coherent account of sublimation, its difference from pathological symptoms and its relation to repression. In summary, on Nietzsche’s account, while repression and pathological symptoms involve a disintegration (of the self), sublimation involves integration. The chapter provides a brief consideration of some post-Freudian accounts of sublimation that, arguably, represent a return to a more Nietzschean approach. In closing, the chapter contrasts the different bases of Nietzsche’s and Freud’s valorization of sublimation.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

In this discussion note it is shown that (H-D*) has the consequence that &quot;A is a non-black raven&quot; confirms &quot;All ravens are black&quot; relative to any tautology! It is noted that Horwich&#39;s (H-D*) bears a strong resemblance to Hempel&#39;s prediction criterion of confirmation and that the prediction criterion faces the same obstacle. A related problem for hypothetico-deductivism in its simplest form-that is, E confirms H iff E is an (observational) consequence of H-is displayed. The discussion concludes with a suggestion about how (H-D*) and simple hypothetico-deductivism might be amended in order to avoid these results. In response to Clark Glymour&#39;s trenchant attacks on hypothetico-deductive accounts of confirmation Paul Horwich in his paper &quot;Explanations of Irrelevance&quot; (1983) proposes the following amended vers...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

His uncompromising and often brutal ideas smashed the comfortable presuppositions and assumptions of religion, morality and science. His was a world not just bereft of God but almost of humanity, breathtaking in both its post-religious starkness and its originality.Bettany Hughes goes in search of the beliefs of a man whose work is amongst the most devastatingly manipulated and misinterpreted in philosophical history. Nietzsche's dislike of systems and of seeking truths left his ideas ambiguous and sometimes incoherent. It was this that made him vulnerable to interpretation, and as a result his thoughts - which warned against the very notion of a political system like totalitarianism - were manipulated to strengthen its ideals.Vocally opposed to anti-Semitism, his anti-Semitic sister made sure he became the poster boy for Hitler's drive for an Aryan ideal. Anti-nationalistic, he came to symbolise a regime he would have loathed. His philosophical quest led him to isolation and ultimately madness, but his ideas helped shape the intellectual landscape of the modern world."Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
