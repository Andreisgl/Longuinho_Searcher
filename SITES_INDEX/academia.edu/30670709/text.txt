We show by analysis that an on-die switching DC-DC converter is feasible for future microprocessor power delivery. The DC-DC converter can be fabricated in an existing CMOS process (90nm-180nm) with a back-end thin-film inductor module. We show that 85% efficiency and 10% output voltage droop can be achieved for 4:1, 3:1, and 2:1 conversion ratios, area overhead of 5% and no additional on-die decoupling capacitance. A 4:1 conversion results in 3.4x smaller input current and 6.8x smaller external decoupling.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersIEEE Transactions on Power ElectronicsA 10 W On-Chip Switched Capacitor Voltage Regulator with Feedforward Regulation Capability for Granular Microprocessor Power Delivery2016 • Johann  KolarDownload Free PDFView PDFACM Transactions on Architecture and Code OptimizationSystem-level Early-stage Modeling and Evaluation of IVR-assisted Processor Power Delivery SystemJingwen LengDespite being employed in numerous efforts to improve power delivery efficiency, the integrated voltage regulator (IVR) approach has yet to be evaluated rigorously and quantitatively in a full power delivery system (PDS) setting. To fulfill this need, we present a system-level modeling and design space exploration framework called Ivory for IVR-assisted power delivery systems. Using a novel modeling methodology, it can accurately estimate power delivery efficiency, static performance characteristics, and dynamic transient responses under different load variations and external voltage/frequency scaling conditions. We validate the model over a wide range of IVR topologies with silicon measurement and SPICE simulation. Finally, we present two case studies using architecture-level performance and power simulators. The first case study focuses on optimal PDS design for multi-core systems, which achieves 8.6% power efficiency improvement over conventional off-chip voltage regulator module...Download Free PDFView PDF2005 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and SystemsCascode Buffer for Monolithic Voltage Conversion Operating at High Input Supply Voltages2005 • Eby FriedmanDownload Free PDFView PDFProceedings of the 54th Annual Design Automation Conference 2017IvoryJingwen LengDownload Free PDFView PDF2014 IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition - APEC 2014A deep trench capacitor based 2:1 and 3:2 reconfigurable on-chip switched capacitor DC-DC converter in 32 nm SOI CMOS2014 • Johann  KolarDownload Free PDFView PDFIEEE Journal of Solid-State CircuitsA 233-MHz 80%-87% efficient four-phase DC-DC converter utilizing air-core inductors on package2000 • Vivek DeDownload Free PDFView PDFSCS 2003.

The HB circuits were implemented with Stacked Transistors (HBSTs) in a cutting-edge 14 nm CMOS technology node in order to enable the integration on the microprocessor die. Compared to a conventional realization of the HBST, it was found that the Active Neutral-Point Clamped (ANPC) HBST topology with Independent Clamp Switches (ICSs) not only ensured balanced blocking voltages across the series-connected transistors, but also featured a more robust operation and achieved higher efficiencies at high output currents. The IVR achieved a maximum efficiency of 85.3% at an output current of 300 mA and a switching frequency of 50 MHz. At the maximum measured output current of 780 mA, the efficiency was 83.1%. The active part of the IVR (power switches, gate-drivers, and level shifters) realized a high maximum current density of 24.7 A/mm2.Download Free PDFView PDFAnalog_Circuit_Design.pdfHerbet H BatistaDownload Free PDFView PDFAnalog Integrated Circuits and Signal Processing an International JournalCascode Monolithic DC-DC Converter for Reliable Operation at High Input Voltages2005 • Eby FriedmanDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
