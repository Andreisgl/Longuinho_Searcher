Hello!
I would like to announce the immediate availability of security releases
1.27.3
and 1.28.2. Due to a mistake in packaging, the releases 1.27.2 and 1.28.1
did
not contain the fix for SyntaxHighlight_GeSHi. This new release does contain
that fix.
The task in question: https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T158689
If you are not running this extension, you do not necessarily need to
upgrade.
Thanks, and I apologize for any confusion in the matter.
