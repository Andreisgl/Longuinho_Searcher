Just as jurisprudence must learn to think sonically, sound studies must endeavour to listen jurisprudentially. Across a series of examples – some well-known, others less so – the article draws out some key elements of the jurisprudence of weaponised sound. It shows how law is necessarily implicated in the story of sonic warfare, and not just insofar as it is prohibitive or emancipatory. Law doesn’t simply oppose violence; it authorises and channels it, and increasingly towards the acoustic. In this respect, it is doing more than just expressing or clearing a path for the expression of other forms of power. Law itself is a form of power that, by means of complex institutional architectures across multiple jurisdictions, crucially shapes our sonic worlds.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersAcoustic weaponsAcoustic weapons2018 • Maya BrehmAcoustic (or sonic) weapons are under research and development in a few countries and have been the subject of interest and much speculation for several decades. Such devices have repeatedly captured the interest of the press, most recently when it was reported in 2016 that several staff members at the American embassy in Cuba were allegedly ‘subjected to an “acoustic attack” using sonic devices’ that caused serious health problems. Neurol- ogists and engineers have challenged this claim. Although a few acoustic devices exist today that could be used as weapons, and sound is implicated in the use of force in the military and law enforcement domains in various ways, the potential for weaponization of acoustic devices has likely been overstated. Nevertheless, consideration of acoustic weapons brings to the fore a number of issues that deserve attention from the perspective of multilateral weapons control.Download Free PDFView PDFA lexicon of law and listeningJames ParkerDownload Free PDFView PDFArticle 36Envisioning Sustainable Security: The Evolving Story of Science and Technology in the Context of Disarmament2019 • Maya BrehmThe renewed interest of stakeholders in multilateral weapons control in the security and disarmament implications of developments in science and technology (S&T) provides an opportunity for critical reflection on and political action aimed at realizing the vision for sustainable security. This paper argues that if substantive progress is to be made, greater attention must be paid to the evolving narrative and underpinning beliefs and assumptions about S&T in the context of disarmament and invites stakeholders in multilateral weapons control to take a closer look at how they make sense of S&T developments in the context of disarmament and related governance initiatives. The paper raises questions about what is or is not identified as problematic in relation to S&T developments and what space is created for political action and encourages stakeholders to envision a technological future that accords with the ideals articulated in Agenda 2030, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Secretary-General’s Agenda for Disarmament.Download Free PDFView PDFTowards an Acoustic Jurisprudence: Law and the Long Range Acoustic DeviceJames ParkerThis article argues for a shift in how we relate to legal thought, practice and experience. It argues for a specifically acoustic jurisprudence, an orientation towards law attuned to questions of sound and listening. The argument is made in the abstract before moving on to an example intended to establish the political stakes of the intervention. My example is the Long Range Acoustic Device, invented at the turn of the century and used increasingly today by military and police forces as a way of amplifying the authority of the state and, in some instances, enacting serious acoustic violence.Download Free PDFView PDFLaw Text Culture A Minor Jurisprudence of Spectacular War: Law As Eye in the SkyJothie RajahDownload Free PDFView PDFLaw & Social InquiryThe Counterterrorism War Paradigm versus International Humanitarian Law: The Legal Contradictions and Global Consequences of the US "War on Terror"2019 • Lisa HajjarSince 2001, we have witnessed the development of a counterterrorism war paradigm built to advance claims about the post-9/11 scope and discretion of US executive power and to articulate specific interpretations of national security interests and strategic objectives in the "war on terror." What makes this a paradigm rather than merely a conglomeration of evolving policies is the cohesiveness and mutual reinforcement of its underlying rationales about the rights of the US government to prosecute a territorially unbounded war against an evolving cast of enemies. Drawing on Bourdieu's concept of a juridical field, the article focuses on how officials who constructed a legal framework for this paradigm, rather than disregarding international law wholesale, have engaged in interpretations and crafted rationales to evade some international humanitarian law (IHL) rules and norms while rejecting the underlying logic or applicability of others. This article traces the counterterrorism war paradigm's development and explains how it now competes with and threatens to supersede the customary law principles enshrined in IHL.Download Free PDFView PDFFucking Hostile: Transforming Spaces through Music Torture2013 • Catherine HoadDownload Free PDFView PDFPredatory War, Drones and Torture: Remapping the Body in PainKevin McSorleyElaine Scarry argues in The Body in Pain that war is a vast and reciprocal swearing on the body, with corporeality key not only to its brutal prosecution but also to the eventual ending of the political 'crisis of substantiation' that war entails. However, her work has not been extensively explored with reference to significant transformations in the embodied experiences of contemporary warfare. This paper thus analyses a particular articulation of late modern warfare that I term predatory war, whose current signature motif is the drone strike, through the lens of Scarry's work. Here, the associated modes of embodiment are radically non-reciprocal, the woundscapes of conflict are profoundly asymmetric, and the affective mediation of bodily injury does not substantiate any ending to the conflict. As such, I argue that the ontology and phenomenology of predatory war increasingly resembles what Scarry identifies as the underlying structure of torture.Download Free PDFView PDFDe-trivialising Music Torture as Torture-liteNatasha LinMusic torture is an important interdisciplinary issue in need of great research, particularly in the wake of the events of 11 September 2001. It is an issue that ties into the broader context of torture, a topic of heated debate in the US-led “War on Terror”. Arising from this debate is the concept of “torture-lite”, a term that has emerged within political, social and academic discourse. Although using music as torture is not a new phenomenon, its importance as a research topic is heightened within the current political and social climate sensitive to the ethics of torture. Such sensitivities have resulted in certain interrogation methods, one of which is music torture, being loosely categorised as torture-lite. However, this categorisation is fraught with misconceived ideas on the relationship between sound and body, and mitigates the destructive potential of music torture. Thus, I am arguing that music torture is not torture-lite, as the term “torture-lite” trivialises the severity of music torture and favours the continuation of its use.Download Free PDFView PDFSecurity Dialogue http://sdi.sagepub.com/content/45/1/43Beyond the Erotics of Orientalism. Lawfare, torture and the racial-sexual grammars of legitimate suffering2014 • Melanie Richter-MontpetitAbstract: Contrary to common sense understandings of torture as a form of information-gathering, confessions elicited through the use of torture produce notoriously unreliable data and most interrogation experts oppose it as a result. With a focus on the US carceral regime in the war on terror, this paper explores the social relations and structures of feelings that make torture and other seemingly ineffective and absurd carceral practices possible and desirable as technologies of security. While much of IR scholarship has focused on the ways in which affective and material economies of Orientalism are central to representations of the “terrorist” threat, this article connects the carceral violences in the racialized lawfare against Muslimified people and spaces to the capture and enslavement of Africans and the concomitant production of the figure of the Black body as the site of enslaveability and openness to gratuitous violence. The paper further explores how these carceral security practices are not simply rooted in racial-sexual logics of Blackness, but themselves constitute key sites and technologies of gendered and sexualized race-making in this era of “post-racial triumph” (Ho Sang and LaBennett 2012).
