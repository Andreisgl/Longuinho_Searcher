We are in this mission together[edit]
We believe this because …
We solve problems better through collaboration.
We find joy, belonging, and connection in doing things together.
We have to balance individual priorities with our shared collective responsibilities.
In practice, this means …
I support my colleagues whenever I can, and ask for help whenever I need it.
I help figure out the problem when I disagree with a proposal.
I work towards real decisions, a shared agenda, and clear accountability.
We do great work and improve[edit]
We do this because …
We have a huge responsibility as stewards of our mission.
Success often comes through learning from failure.
Our communities inspire both our work and the way we work.
In practice, this means …
I share my work early, often, and respond to feedback.
I strive for measurable progress towards our goals rather than for perfection.
I invite playfulness and creativity at work where possible.
We welcome everyone who shares our Vision and Values[edit]
We believe this because …
To build the sum of all knowledge, we need to embrace human diversity.
Our differences are powerful and require nurturing.
We do our best work when we understand different perspectives.
In practice, this means …
I contribute to making spaces safe for people to express themselves.
I recognize my own privilege and believe others about their lived experiences.
I repair the harm that I cause and model accountability for myself and others.
We listen and share with curiosity[edit]
We do this because …
People think and communicate in different ways.
Curiosity and candor are how we learn to understand and trust each other.
Assumptions and biases are at the root of most misunderstandings.
In practice, this means …
I communicate honestly, clearly, and with empathy.
I recognize the limits of my expertise and trust people closest to the problem.
I approach unexpected information with humility and an open mind.
