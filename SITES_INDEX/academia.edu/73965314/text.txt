In this article, I analyze the potential for epigenetic research to operationalize the social science theory of embodiment, which describes how the social and material worlds manifest in our physical bodies. Epigenetic modifications can be triggered by environmental stressors, to which minority populations are more likely to be exposed. In turn, these stressors are linked to disorders that increase COVID-19 susceptibility. Thus, epigenetic modifications provide an avenue by which racialized social experiences may become embodied as comorbidities that enhance vulnerability to COVID-19. I contextualize the epigenome’s permeability in larger discussions about the social construction of race, inheritance, and calls for racial equity.See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersThe American Journal of BioethicsStructural Racism in the COVID-19 Pandemic: Moving ForwardAlicia SantiagoDownload Free PDFView PDFInternational Journal of Environmental Research and Public HealthBlack–White Risk Differentials in COVID-19 (SARS-COV2) Transmission, Mortality and Case Fatality in the United States: Translational Epidemiologic Perspective and ChallengesTatiana PiccoliBackground: Social and health inequities predispose vulnerable populations to adverse morbidity and mortality outcomes of epidemics and pandemics. While racial disparities in cumulative incidence (CmI) and mortality from the influenza pandemics of 1918 and 2009 implicated Blacks with survival disadvantage relative to Whites in the United States, COVID-19 currently indicates comparable disparities. We aimed to: (a) assess COVID-19 CmI by race, (b) determine the Black–White case fatality (CF) and risk differentials, and (c) apply explanatory model for mortality risk differentials. Methods: COVID-19 data on confirmed cases and deaths by selective states health departments were assessed using a cross-sectional ecologic design. Chi-square was used for CF independence, while binomial regression model for the Black–White risk differentials. Results: The COVID-19 mortality CmI indicated Blacks/AA with 34% of the total mortality in the United States, albeit their 13% population size.

However, data in many parts of the world, especially in the United States, begin to show that there is a sector of society suffering a more significant impact from this pandemic. The Black population is more vulnerable than the White population to infection and death by COVID-19, with hypertension and diabetes mellitus as probable predisposing factors. Over time, multiple disparities have been observed between the health of Black and White populations, associated mainly with socioeconomic inequalities. However, some mechanisms and pathophysiological susceptibilities begin to be elucidated that are related directly to the higher prevalence of multiple diseases in the Black population, including infection and death by COVID-19. Plasma vitamin D levels and evolutionary adaptations of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in Black people differ considerably from those of other race...Download Free PDFView PDFAmerican Journal of Physiology-Heart and Circulatory PhysiologyRacial and socioeconomic disparity associates with differences in cardiac DNA methylation among men with end-stage heart failurePepin, Mark EA bimodal signature of cardiac DNA methylation in heart failure corresponds with racial differences in all-cause mortality following mechanical circulatory support. Racial differences in promoter methylation disproportionately affect metabolic signaling pathways. Socioeconomic factors are associated with racial differences in the cardiac methylome among men with end-stage heart failure.Download Free PDFView PDFAmerican Journal of Human BiologyA biosocial return to race? A cautionary view for the postgenomic era2022 • Maurizio Meloni, Tessa Moll, Ayuba IssakaRecent studies demonstrating epigenetic and developmental sensitivity to early environments, as exemplified by fields like the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) and environmental epigenetics, are bringing new data and models to bear on debates about race, genetics, and society. we first survey the historical prominence of models of environmental determinism in early formulations of racial thinking to illustrate how notions of direct environmental effects on bodies have been used to naturalize racial hierarchy and inequalities in the past. Next, we conduct a scoping review of postgenomic work in environmental epigenetics and DOHaD that looks at the role of race/ethnicity in human health (2000-2021). Although there is substantial heterogeneity in how race is conceptualized and interpreted across studies, we observe practices that may unwittingly encourage typological thinking, including: using DNA methylation as a novel marker of racial classification; neglect of variation and reversibility within supposedly homogenous racial groups; and a tendency to label and reify whole groups as pathologized or impaired. Even in the very different politico-economic and epistemic context of contemporary postgenomic science, these trends echo deeply held beliefs in Western thinking which claimed that different environments shape different bodies and then used this logic to argue for essential differences between Europeans and non-Europeans. We conclude with a series of suggestions on interpreting and reporting findings in these fields that we feel will help researchers harness this work to benefit disadvantaged groups while avoiding the inadvertent dissemination of new and old forms of stigma or prejudice.Download Free PDFView PDFJournal of Personalized MedicinePrecision Medicine and Public Health: New Challenges for Effective and Sustainable HealthDeborah TraversiThe development of high-throughput omics technologies represents an unmissable opportunity for evidence-based prevention of adverse effects on human health. However, the applicability and access to multi-omics tests are limited. In Italy, this is due to the rapid increase of knowledge and the high levels of skill and economic investment initially necessary. The fields of human genetics and public health have highlighted the relevance of an implementation strategy at a national level in Italy, including integration in sanitary regulations and governance instruments. In this review, the emerging field of public health genomics is discussed, including the polygenic scores approach, epigenetic modulation, nutrigenomics, and microbiomes implications. Moreover, the Italian state of implementation is presented. The omics sciences have important implications for the prevention of both communicable and noncommunicable diseases, especially because they can be used to assess the health status ...Download Free PDFView PDFCahiers de l’Urmis [Online]Ethno-racial disparities in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality2021 • Simeng WangThe COVID-19 pandemic, by the nature of this crisis and its primarily sanitary, medical and biological management, offers an exceptional opportunity for observations on the scientific debates surrounding the notion of “race”, used and conceptualised at times as a biological reality, at others as a social construct. Based on a synthetic reading of a variety of scientific productions –in medicine, public health, epidemiology, and social sciences– discussing ethno-racial disparities in COVID-19 related morbidity and mortality, this article shows that these two models of interpretation –biological/genetic and socio-economic/socio-demographic– do not stand in opposition to each other: the relationships between race and identified risk factors in COVID-19 related morbidity and mortality, as recognised by researchers are often conjointly conditioned by both biological mechanisms and socio-economic factors. Furthermore, the intersectional approach –articulating various social relations of race, class, gender, age, disability, etc.– proves to be particularly fruitful in grasping the ethno-racial disparities in COVID-19 related morbidity and mortality. La pandémie de Covid-19, par la nature de cette crise et de sa gestion avant tout sanitaire, médicale et biologique, offre une occasion inédite pour observer les débats scientifiques autour de la notion de « race », utilisée et conceptualisée tantôt en tant que réalité biologique, tantôt en tant que construction sociale. En s’appuyant sur une lecture synthétique d’un éventail des productions scientifiques – en médecine, en santé publique, en épidémiologie et en sciences sociales – discutant des disparités ethno-raciales dans les cas de morbidité et de mortalité liées au Covid-19, cet article montre que les deux modèles d’interprétation – biologique/génétique et socio-économique/sociodémographique – ne sont pas antagoniques l’un de l’autre : les relations entre la race et les facteurs de risque de morbidité et de mortalité liés au Covid-19, qui ont été mises en évidence par des chercheurs, sont souvent conditionnées à la fois par des mécanismes biologiques et des facteurs socio-économiques. Par ailleurs, l’approche intersectionnelle – articulant les divers rapports sociaux de race, de classe, de genre, d’âge, de handicap, etc. – s’avère particulièrement féconde dans l’appréhension des disparités ethno-raciales dans les cas de morbidité et de mortalité liées au Covid-19.Download Free PDFView PDFDevelopmental Child WelfareCovid, racism and Black Lives Matter: A deadly constellationgraham musicThis paper looks at how people from Black and Minority Ethnic groups have been disproportionately affected by COVID. The paper links this with both psycho-social factors and childhood stress and trauma. It looks at the effects of unconscious racism on the minds and physiology of those affected. The relationship between the impact of stress, trauma, racism and Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) is discussed, and how ACEs are linked with very poor later physical and mental health outcomes. The article suggests that these issues are highly over determined but that for change to occur we need interventions at a range of levels, from the macro-political, psychosocial, individual and economic, including unconscious implicit biases.Download Free PDFView PDFBioSocietiesRace and Biomedicine Beyond the Lab: 21st Century Mobilisations of Genetics—Introduction to the Special IssueVivette García DeisterDownload Free PDFView PDFContemporary Political TheoryPolitics in the Time of COVIDAlicia ValdésDownload Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
