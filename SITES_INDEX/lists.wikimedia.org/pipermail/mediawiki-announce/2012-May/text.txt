I'm happy to announce the availability of the first stable release
of the new MediaWiki 1.19 release series.
MediaWiki 1.19 is a large release that contains many new features and bug
fixes. This is a summary of the major changes of interest to users.
You can consult the RELEASE-NOTES-1.19 file for the full list of changes in
this version.
Our thanks go to everyone who helped to improve MediaWiki by testing the
beta
release and submitting bug reports.
****************************************************************
                             What's new?
****************************************************************
MediaWiki 1.19 brings the usual host of various bugfixes and new features.
Comprehensive list of what's new is in the release notes.
* Bumped MySQL version requirement to 5.0.2.
* Disable the partial HTML and MathML rendering options for Math,
  and render as PNG by  default.
  * MathML mode was so incomplete most people thought it simply didn't work.
* New skins/common/*.css files usable by skins instead of having to copy
piles of
  generic styles from MonoBook or Vector's css.
* The default user signature now contains a talk link in addition to the
user link.
* Searching blocked usernames in block log is now clearer.
* Better timezone recognition in user preferences.
* Extensions can now participate in the extraction of titles from URL paths.
* The command-line installer supports various RDBMSes better.
* The interwiki links table can now be accessed also when the interwiki
cache
  is used (used in the API and the Interwiki extension).
Internationalization
- --------------------
* More gender support (for instance in user lists).
* Add languages: Canadian English.
* Language converter improved, e.g. it now works depending on the page
  content language.
* Time and number-formatting magic words also now depend on the page
  content language.
* Bidirectional support further improved after 1.18.
