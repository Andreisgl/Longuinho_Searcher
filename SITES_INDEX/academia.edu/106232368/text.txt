Dominguez-SalasFood systems are failing to deliver healthy, accessible diets while not exceeding the boundaries of planetary resources. The international community has called for food systems transformation and policy solutions to secure healthy diets for all. These strategies, however, focus on supply and the market rather than a healthy diet perspective. This paper argues that food systems transformation should incorporate a dietary perspective that is guided by information on diets, dietary trends, consumer motives, and the food environment characteristics. It shows that dietary trends differ by food system development stage, thus different transformational approaches are required. It reviews the knowledge on drivers of consumer choices and discusses conflicting objectives and trade-offs among the multiple food systems actors. It outlines promising policy options and reflects on how a dietary perspective may contribute to sustainable food systems transformations.Download Free PDFView PDFFeed the Future Innovation Lab for Livestock Systems Animal Source Food Consumption and Human Nutrition Annotated Bibliography2020 • Karah MechlowitzDownload Free PDFView PDFAfrican Journal of Food, Agriculture, Nutrition and DevelopmentChange in soy and nutrition knowledge and perceptions of smallholder South African farmers after attending a single one day soy nutrition training workshop: A pilot study2020 • Sarahi  MoralesThe main aim of this pilot study was to assess smallholder soy farmers’ knowledge and perceptions of soy immediately before and after participating in a one-day soy nutrition training workshop. A pre-post study design was used among a convenience sample of 78 soy smallholder farmers from Kwa Zulu-Natal, South Africa(SA). A total of 78 men and five women participated in the training, but because only five women attended,gender comparison analysis was not carried out.A soy nutrition training workshop, including soy cooking demonstrations, tasting, recipe development, that is based on the Social Cognitive Theory, was implemented for eight consecutive hours with one break of 30 minutes. Pre- and post-quantitative data measuring,soy knowledge and perceptions were collected using a modified version of a survey, tested for face and content validity and reliability,and used previously in other research study projects by the same authors among low-resource communities in SA.

Poor dietary diversity is associated with malnutrition, stunting, poor gut health, pregnancy complications, and cognitive impairment. Overcoming the underlying and basic causes of poor dietary diversity is imperative through policymaking. This current literature review discussed about intervention policies to improve dietary diversity at the individual and population levels. Literature search was carried out in some databases, i.e., Pubmed/Medline, Google Scholar, and Google with key word search such as dietary diversity, improvement, programs, interventions, and policies. The synthesized articles included observational studies, experimental studies, and grey literature on Dietary diversity programs and interventions. Articles on biodiversity and microbial diversity were not included. Dietary diversity can outgrow by knowing the policy on food-based interventions which are closely related to the food system and non-food-based interventio...Download Free PDFView PDFPLOS ONEThe impact of poverty reduction and development interventions on non-communicable diseases and their behavioural risk factors in low and lower-middle income countries: A systematic review2018 • Francesco BrancaDownload Free PDFView PDFPLOS ONEEducational intervention and livestock ownership successfully improved the intake of animal source foods in 6–23 months old children in rural communities of Northern Ethiopia: Quasi-experimental studyGebretsadik BerheBackground Animal source foods (ASFs) are rich in high-quality proteins, including essential amino acids and highly bioavailable micronutrients vital for child growth and cognitive development. But, the daily consumption of ASFs among 6–23 months old children is very low in Tigray, Northern Ethiopia. Objective The study aimed to assess the effectiveness of nutrition education intervention to improve the consumption of ASFs among 6–23 months old children from rural communities with strict religious fasting traditions of avoiding intake of ASFs in Northern Ethiopia. Methods A quasi-experimental study was conducted in two food insecure districts namely Samre Seharti (intervention) and Tanqua Abergele (comparison). The mother-child pairs in the intervention group (n = 140) received nutrition education based on the barriers and available resources for optimal consumption of ASFs among children and followed up for nine months. The mother-child pairs in the comparison group (n = 153) recei...Download Free PDFView PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFLoading PreviewSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
