It comprises an exhaustive and detailed catalogue of all magical material in cuneiform texts in Sumerian and Akkadian from the Middle Babylonian and Middle Assyrian periods (ca. 1500–1000 BCE). The work begins with a typology of the different sub-groups of incantations, the physical properties of the tablets, an innovative survey of the text formats, a discussion of drawings on magical texts and a critical discussion of the different paratextual comments, followed by an overview of the geographical and archival setting and an examination on the social context of the corpus.The circulation of magical texts during the Late Bronze Age is investigated by outlining the corpus itself: its thematic grouping of incantations, division of unilingual and bilingual texts, local scribal traditions and their influences. With respect to the question of whether the standardization of incantations took place in Mesopotamia during the Second Millennium, an extensive chapter provides a comparative analysis of the incantation corpora of the Third and Second Millennium against the standardized ritual series of the First Millennium. Fifty cuneiform texts have been edited and translated, accompanied by a thorough philological commentary.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Mesopotamia is no different, and the earliest examples of oneiromancy can be traced as far back as the Third Millennium BCE. References to dreams and dream reports are found in a wide-variety of letters, literary texts, and royal inscriptions. Dreams (both spontaneous and induced) were considered signs from the divine sphere which were sometimes immediately intelligible, and sometimes needed extensive interpretation. Our knowledge of Mesopotamian dream interpretation has survived through a lengthy omen series from Nineveh (Kuyunjik), coined after its incipit Zaqīqu/Ziqīqu, and which consisted at one point of at least 11 tablets. Oppenheim called this scholarly work the "Assyrian Dreambook", suggesting it was an Assyrian invention, but in addition to Assyria (Nineveh, Kalḫu and Assur), Akkadian dream omens have come down to us from Babylonia (Old Babylonian, Middle Babylonian and Neo-Babylonian periods), Ḫattuša and Susa. After Oppenheim's preliminary work, no systematic investigation has been undertaken into this text corpus. The present study seeks to reconstruct the series Zaqīqu/Ziqīqu and to investigate the development of Mesopotamian dream omens from the Second Millennium and the First Millennium, providing a full edition of the available material, both old and new. This study will also examine the topical arrangement of omens in the series, together with the use of the principle of "keywords/keysigns" by the ancient scholars. Since the series Zaqīqu/Ziqīqu also contained incantations (Tablet I) and rituals averting evil dreams (Tablet X, XI), an in-depth study will be undertaken in order to ascertain their relationship to the larger structure of the series, as well as their affiliation with texts outside the series, such as, for example, the Assyrian Dream Compendium, which is a specific collection of incantations and rituals averting evil dreams.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

(For PDF, please email)This chapter investigates the dynamics of envy and jealousy in diagnostic, therapeutic, and magic... more This chapter investigates the dynamics of envy and jealousy in diagnostic, therapeutic, and magical texts from Mesopotamia. In these texts, both envy and jealousy are aggressive emotions sharing the same emotional attitude, that is, anxiety over a change in what one has or does not have. They are, therefore, frequently conceptualized as status related. In the pertinent incantation genres, the ritual’s protagonist or client – fueled by feelings of anger, resentment, and revenge – either projects his misfortune as being caused by the envious actions of others (who have performed acts of witchcraft against him), or he acts violently out of emotional rivalry, with the intent to inflict harm on his opponents, especially in the context of amorous or professional relationships. The idea that emotions are not restricted to humans alone is displayed by a group of demonic figures, such as Lamashtu and the Mesopotamian variants of the succubus (Ardat lilî/Lilītu) and incubus (Eṭel lilî/Lilû), who, out of envy of certain aspects of humanity, take their revenge upon humankind.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Form... more Von Soden (GAG 74 § 55j no. 13) briefly described the nominal pattern PiRīS as follows: ass. Form von parīs. When we read the brief paragraph on PaRīS, we find two examples: zaqīpu (nA ziqīpu) "aufgerichtetes, Pfahl" and dalīlu (dilīlu) "Huldigung" (§ 55i no. 10). Von Soden's claim was duly repeated by Fox (2003, 187), without offering new information other than to explain this change by means of Assyrian vowel dissimilation 2. Alternatively, Kienast (2001, 76 § 62.1) favours an explanatory Murmelvokal (or epenthetic vowel), and transcribes dilīlu as delīlu. In other grammatical studies of Neo-Assyrian this feature is not commented upon. No cases of PiRīS are known from the Old Assyrian period (Kouwenberg 2017, 123 § 4.2.2.5), however this form began to appear in certain Middle Assyrian administrative documents and royal inscriptions. This paper aims to provide further examples of PaRīS > PiRīS together with a thorough discussion of when this sound change was active. In addition, the problematic case of the noun zaqīqu ~ ziqīqu, particularly known from the eponymous dream omen series, will be investigated.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It concerns a so-called clod incantation, which, when recited, transfers the evil of the dream to the ritually prepared substitute, i.e., the clod (kurbannu). A first edition of BM 38553 is offered, together with a discussion on the hitherto ignored interrelationship between dream incantations and the dream omens mainly known from the Zaqīqu series. Cet article concerne la tablette babylonienne tardive BM 38553, qui contient une incantation similaire à EN₂ tattapḫa dŠamaš ina šadî erēni, connue par le compendium du rituel du rêve assyrien (ADRC), mais qui présente des différences et des variations significatives. Il s’agit d’une incantation dite de la motte de terre, qui, lorsqu’elle était récitée, transférait le mal du rêve au substitut préparé rituellement, c’est-à-dire la motte de terre (kurbannu).

Von Soden in Das Akkadisches Handwörterbuch identifies the entry with green cardamom (Elettaria cardamomum). This causes problems, as cardamom is not endemic to Southern Mesopotamia. As such, this claim deserves further investigation and therefore the goal of this study is to discuss possible identifications of this plant. The botanical qaqullu displays an etymological connection between qāqullā , as it appears in Aramaic, and the Akkadian noun qaqullu(m). In this study, we will review the previous lexical treatment of this noun, discuss its possible meaning and the etymologic connection between the Akkadian noun and the Arabic and Aramaic cognates.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

No cases of PiRīS are known from the Old Assyrian period (Kouwenberg 2017, 123 § 4.2.2.5), however this form began to appear in certain Middle Assyrian administrative documents and royal inscriptions. This paper aims to provide further examples of PaRīS > PiRīS together with a thorough discussion of when this sound change was active. In addition, the problematic case of the noun zaqīqu ~ ziqīqu, particularly known from the eponymous dream omen series, will be investigated.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It concerns a so-called clod incantation, which, when recited, transfers the evil of the dream to the ritually prepared substitute, i.e., the clod (kurbannu). A first edition of BM 38553 is offered, together with a discussion on the hitherto ignored interrelationship between dream incantations and the dream omens mainly known from the Zaqīqu series. Cet article concerne la tablette babylonienne tardive BM 38553, qui contient une incantation similaire à EN₂ tattapḫa dŠamaš ina šadî erēni, connue par le compendium du rituel du rêve assyrien (ADRC), mais qui présente des différences et des variations significatives. Il s’agit d’une incantation dite de la motte de terre, qui, lorsqu’elle était récitée, transférait le mal du rêve au substitut préparé rituellement, c’est-à-dire la motte de terre (kurbannu). Une première édition de BM 38553 est proposée, ainsi qu’une discussion sur la relation jusqu’ici ignorée entre les incantations de rêve et les présages de rêve principalement connus par la série Zaqīqu.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Von Soden in Das Akkadisches Handwörterbuch identifies the entry with green cardamom (Elettaria cardamomum). This causes problems, as cardamom is not endemic to Southern Mesopotamia. As such, this claim deserves further investigation and therefore the goal of this study is to discuss possible identifications of this plant. The botanical qaqullu displays an etymological connection between qāqullā , as it appears in Aramaic, and the Akkadian noun qaqullu(m). In this study, we will review the previous lexical treatment of this noun, discuss its possible meaning and the etymologic connection between the Akkadian noun and the Arabic and Aramaic cognates.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The tablet has been identified from the start as a letter, although the obverse and reverse were displaced. Additionally, the previous copy in VS 1, 105 misses out one line completely, while a full edition of the text has never been presented. Following our revised edition of the tablet, VS 1, 105 is a letter order, written by a high official to his subordinates, ordering them to bring barley from the otherwise unknown geographical places of Ḫirdiš and Sammalūnu. While the archaeological context and the addressee, as well as the recipients of the letter, are not preserved, an attempt is made to connect the tablet to the individual Adad-šar-nišē, who is mentioned on two occasions in the text.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

It contains a large collection (Sammeltafel) of rather difficult unilingual Akkadian (with large parts Sumerian) incantations which remain largely unedited to the present day. Its format as prism suggests its context within the curriculum of Ḫatušša. One point of discussion will be how KBo 1.18 reflects the influences of the traditional Mesopotamian incantation literature? When compared with other contemporary Akkadian and Sumerian incantations, one will notice that the prism KBo 1.18 has its own particular interesting features which will be discussed in the present paper.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Enmity against Samsu-ditana"
In the last years of the Late Old Babylonian period the heartland of the First Dynasty of Baby... more "In the last years of the Late Old Babylonian period the heartland of the First Dynasty of Babylon was under pressure from multiple hostile entities, e.g. Ḫittites, Kassites and Hurrians in the north and the First Sealand Dynasty in the south. Traditionally, it is assumed that the Kassites took over the power vacuum and took control over Babylon directly after the ‘Fall of Babylon’. However, recent studies on chronology and new published archives from this period have proven that the situation was more complicated. This paper will contribute to this discussion with an unpublished Akkadian literary text (HS 1885+) from the Hilprecht-Sammlung in Jena. In this epic Samsu-ditāna, the last king of the First Dynasty of Babylon is vividly antagonized by a named king of a rival dynasty. Hence, a new synchronism is offered and discussed. In order to fully comprehend the historical implications of HS 1885+ , the political landscape in Babylonia before and after the ‘Fall of Babylon’ will be portrait from three different perspectives, i.e. (I) the First Dynasty of Babylon (II) Kassites and (III) First Sealand Dynasty, hopefully shedding some new light on the so-called ‘Dark Age’ of the second millennium B.C. Elyze Zomer (Universität Leipzig)"Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
