Abkhaz,[b] also known as Abkhazian,[4][5] is a Northwest Caucasian language most closely related to Abaza. It is spoken mostly by the Abkhaz people. It is one of the official languages of Abkhazia,[a] where around 100,000 people speak it.[1] Furthermore, it is spoken by thousands of members of the Abkhazian diaspora in Turkey, Georgia's autonomous republic of Adjara, Syria, Jordan, and several Western countries. 27 October is the day of the Abkhazian language in Georgia.[6]
Classification[edit]
Abkhaz is a Northwest Caucasian language[7][8] and is thus related to Adyghe. The language of Abkhaz is especially close to Abaza, and they are sometimes considered dialects of the same language,[9][10] Abazgi, of which the literary dialects of Abkhaz and Abaza are simply two ends of a dialect continuum. Grammatically, the two are very similar; however, the differences in phonology are substantial, it also contains elements characteristic of Kabardian;[11][12] these are the main reasons for many others[13][14] to prefer keeping the two separate, while others[12][9] still refer to it as the Tapanta dialect of Abkhaz. Chirikba[15] mentions that there are possible indications that proto-Northwest Caucasian, could have divided firstly into proto-Circassian and to proto-Ubykh-Abkhaz; Ubykh then being the closest relative to Abkhaz, with it only later on being influenced by Circassian.
Geographical distribution[edit]
Distribution of Abkhaz in the Caucasus.
There is not an agreed number of speakers of Abkhaz, and there are widely different numbers. It is agreed that today most of the Abkhaz people do not live in Abkhazia. In the census conducted by the Republic of Abkhazia in 2011, Abkhazians comprised 50.8% of the population, around 122,175 people; of these 92,838 speaking it natively.[16][8] Only two of the original dialects are still spoken in Abkhazia. The Bzyp dialect is still spoken in its homeland northwest of Sukhumi, stretching from the Bzyp River to the western environs of Sukhumi and the Psyrtskha valley, whereas the Abzhywa dialect is spoken south-east of Sukhumi.[8][17][18] The rest of the Abkhaz speaking population inhabits other neighbouring areas.
The exact number of Abkhazians and Abkhaz speakers in Turkey is not clear. The Turkish census denotes 13,951, but the figures are dubious, since the numbers of Abkhazians that came from the beginning of the 19th century to the middle of the 20th have been documented at around 30 thousand.[19] Ethnologue gives 150,000 Abkhazians living in Turkey, of these 50,000 still speak the language.[1] The Joshua Project says there are 166,000 ethnic Abkhazians in Turkey,[20] and the head of the Abkhaz federation says there are in between 500-700 thousand Abkhazians in Turkey.[21] In general, Abkhaz seems to have been lost by most of the descendants, and bilingualism being low except in some specific areas, although there seems to be an effort for the new generation to learn the language with public schools being able to teach Abkhaz and together with 7,836 second language speakers.[22][23][8] Abkhazian villages are concentrated around the cities of Adapazarı, Düzce, Sinop, Hendek and Samsun in the northern part, and in the west around cities such as Bilecik, Inegöl and Eskişehir; they are mainly found in the provinces of Sakarya and Bolu in the western part, and near the Çoruh river in the north-east.[24][8][1]
Historically the dialects of Sadz, Ahchypsy and Tsabal were located in Abkhazia; Sadz being spoken from the Bzyp river to the Matsesta River, and further to the north-west bordering the Sochypsta River.[25] Today they are exclusively spoken in the northwestern part of Turkey, specially in the Sakarya province, it being spoken in 14 villages.
The other major place where Abkhaz is spoken is in Karachay-Cherkessia, where the Northern dialects are spoken, although there they are considered as a separate language and form the literary Abaza language.[26][27] They are spoken by 37,831 people in Russia,[28] mostly in the south of Stavropol Krai in the area around Kislovodsk, and in the upper Kuma river area.[8]
Abkhaz is also spoken as a minority language around the world. There is a considerable number of Abkhaz speakers in Adjara in southern Georgia, with the diaspora concentrating itself around the capital Batumi,[29] with about 982 people considering Abkhaz their first language.[30] In the Russian census of 2010, 6,786 speakers of Abkhaz were reported in Russia.[28] In Ukraine there are around 1,458 according to the 2001 census, but of these only 317 speak Abkhazian.[31] There were also communities in Syria, Jordan and Iraq with around 5,000 Abkhazians,[32][8] although this number could reach 10,000 according to the Abkhazia's Foreign Ministry.[33] The biggest western diaspora is in Germany, with around 5,000 speakers,[34] but other communities are found in countries such as the United States, United Kingdom, Austria, France, Belgium and so on.
History[edit]
The earliest indisputable extant written records of the Abkhaz language are in the Arabic script, recorded by the Turkish traveller Evliya Çelebi in the 17th century.[35] Abkhaz has been used as a literary language for only about 100 years.
It was suggested that certain inscriptions on Ancient Greek pottery which had been considered nonsense are in fact written in Abkhaz-Adydge languages.[36] The methodology of the research was criticised and the results called improbable.[37]
In 1918, Tbilisi State University became the first institution of higher education to teach Abkhazian language. The founders of the university began to take care of the development and scientific study of the Abkhazian language. At the meeting of the Council of Professors held at Tbilisi State University in 1918, Ivane Javakhishvili noted the scientific importance of studying Caucasian languages. In 1918, by the decision of the Council of Professors, Petre Charaia was invited to teach the Abkhazian language, and from 1925, this mission was continued by Dimitri Gulia and Simon Janashia.[38][39]
Dialects[edit]
Classification[edit]
Abkhaz is generally viewed as having three major dialects:[40]
Abzhywa, spoken in the Caucasus, and named after the historical area of Abzhywa (Абжьыуа), sometimes referred to as Abzhui, the Russified form of the name (Abzhuiski dialekt, derived from the Russian form of the name for the area, Абжуа).
Bzyb or Bzyp, spoken in the Caucasus and in Turkey, and named after the Bzyb (Abkhaz: Бзыԥ) area.
Sadz, nowadays spoken only in Turkey, formerly also spoken between the rivers Bzyp and Khosta.
The literary language is based on the Abzhywa dialect.[41]
Below is a classification of Abkhaz dialects according to Chirikba (1996):[42]: xv 
Common Abkhaz (Proto-Abkhaz)
North Abkhaz
Tapanta
Ashkharywa
South Abkhaz
Southwestern
Sadz
Southeastern
Ahchypsy, Bzyp
Tsabal, Abzhywa
General characteristics[edit]
In some form or the other, all dialects are richer in phonemes than the standard Abzhywa dialect.[43] The only dialects spoken in Abkhazia are Abzhywa and Bzyp. Northern dialects which are the basis for literary Abaza are spoken in Karachay-Cherkessia, while the other dialects such as Sadz are spoken in Turkey due to Russian invasions in the 19th century.[44][45][46] While most differences are phonetic, differences in the lexicon are present, although mostly due to exterior contact.[47] Bzyp contains the most preserved lexicon, with few borrowings. Abzhywa has adopted many loans from Kartvelian, specially Mingrelian; Sadz on the other hand has more words from Circassian. Northern dialects in general have more loanwords from Persian, Arabic, Turkish and Circassian.
Phonology[edit]
Main article: Abkhaz phonology
Consonants[edit]
Abkhaz has a very large number of consonants (58 in the literary dialect), with three-way voiced/voiceless/ejective and palatalized/labialized/plain distinctions. By contrast, the language has only two phonemically distinct vowels, which have several allophones depending on the palatal and/or labial quality of adjacent consonants.
Labialised alveolo-palatal fricatives are found in the Bzyp and Sadz dialects of Abkhaz, but not in Abzhywa. Plain alveolo-palatal consonants and the pharyngealised and labialised-pharyngealised uvular fricatives are unique to the Bzyp dialect.
The consonants highlighted in red and in brackets are the 4 kinds of labialisation described by Chirikba.[48]

Vowels[edit]
The nature of the vowels of Abkhaz is not clear. Some linguists,[49][50][51] characterise the vowel system as a 2 degree vertical vowel system; with the two vowels being distinguished by height, 'ә' being the high/close vowel, and 'а' being the low/open. This system would very closely resemble the one found in Adyghe. The quality of 'ә' in this case, is usually represented as [ɨ] if the vowel is in a stressed position, and being unaffected by its neighbouring consonants.
Close
ɨ
Open-mid
a
Other linguists[52][53] however, mainly Russian ones, describe the vowels differently. They describe the sound of 'ә' being completely different from [ɨ], and by their descriptions being closer to [ə]. The 'а' is described as being particularly back, likely [ɑ].

Grammar[edit]
This article or section should specify the language of its non-English content, using {{lang}}, {{transliteration}} for transliterated languages, and {{IPA}} for phonetic transcriptions, with an appropriate ISO 639 code. Wikipedia's multilingual support templates may also be used. See why. (June 2022)
Typical of Northwest Caucasian languages, Abkhaz is an agglutinative language that relies heavily on affixation.[54]  It has an ergative-absolutive typology, such that the subject of an intransitive verb functions identically to the object of a transitive verb.[55]  Notably, Abkhaz expresses ergativity entirely through the ordering of subjects and objects within verb constructions[55] rather than through overt case marking as most other ergative languages do.[56]
All Latin transliterations in this section utilize the system explicated in Chirikba (2003) (see Abkhaz alphabet for the details).[57]
Verbs[edit]
DETR:detrimental
BENF:benefactive

EXT:extension
MSD:masdar
RECI:reciprocal
Abkhaz morphology features a highly complex verb system that could be called a "sentence in miniature."[58]  Chirikba (2003) describes Abkhaz as a "verbocentric" language wherein verbs occupy the "central part of the morphology."[59] However, despite its complexity, Abkhaz verbal morphology is highly regular.[60]
Abkhaz, being an ergative language, makes a strong distinction between transitive and intransitive verbs, as well as dynamic and stative.
Stative verbs describe states of being, roughly analogous to copular phrases in English, as in дхәыҷуп (d-x˚əčә́-wə-p - "she is a child").[61]  Dynamic verbs express direct actions, functioning more closely to standard English verbs.  Dynamic verbs possess the full range of aspect, mood and tense forms, in contrast to statives, which do not.[61]
Some verbs, called inversives, combine certain features of both stative and dynamic verbs.[61]
Another important verbal distinction in Abkhaz is finite versus non-finite, referring to the duration of the action.  Finite verbs usually contain enough information to form a complete sentence, whereas non-finite verbs typically form dependent clauses.[61]
Finite
дызбеит
"I saw him/her""
Non-Finite
избаз
"whom I saw"
Verb stems can be derived in a number of ways, including compounding, affixation, reduplication or conversion from another part of speech.[62]
Roughly equivalent to the infinitive,[58] or to a so-called "verbal noun,"[63] the Masdar form of the verb resembles the English gerund.  It is formed by the addition of a specific suffix to a bare verb stem, -ра (-ra) for a dynamic verb and -заара (-zaara) for a stative.[64]
аԥхьараá-px’a-raART-read-MSDаԥхьараá-px’a-raART-read-MSD"to read/be reading"
Various prefixes can be added to the Masdar to form entire dependent clauses, as in[58]
аԥибаҽраa-pә́-j+ba-č-raART-PREV-RECI-break-MSDаԥибаҽраa-pә́-j+ba-č-raART-PREV-RECI-break-MSD"breaking each other"
However, the fully conjugated personal Abkhaz verb forms are "templatic," with each grammatical distinction occupying a specific "slot" or "position" within the broader verb template.[65] Verbs are thus formed by the addition of various affixes to the verb stem; these affixes express such distinctions as transitivity, person and stative/dynamic quality, occupying rigid positions within the overall verb structure.[58]  There is a high degree of agreement between verbs and other parts of speech.[58]  Overall, the Abkhaz verb is constructed as follows:
[First Position]+[Second Position]+[Third Position]+[Indirect Object]+[Reflexive]+[Free Preverb]+[Stem Preverb]+[Agent]+[Negation]+[Causative]+STEM+[Extension]+[Number]+[Aspect]+[Tense]+[Negation]+[Ending Suffixes][66]
Not all of these elements will necessarily co-occur in every verb. The individual parts of verb morphology are addressed below.
First Position
The first prefixing element of the verb complex expresses either the subject of an intransitive verb in the absolutive construction, or the direct object of a transitive verb in an ergative construction.  The following table illustrates the various agreement markers which can occupy the first position.[67] These prefixes can either be in their long forms, containing the letters inside the parenthesis, or in the short forms that don't contain them. The rules for using them are the following:[68]
If the prefix is proceeded by a consonant cluster, the long form shall be used.
If the stress falls on the prefix, the long form shall be used
If the prefix is not proceeded by a consonant cluster, the short form shall be used.
If the stress doesn't fall on the prefix, the short form shall be used.

"he is sleeping."
Negation (Stative)
The negation prefix m- occupies this position in a stative verb construction.[70]
дтәамd-t’ºa-m(s)he-sit-NEGдтәамd-t’ºa-m(s)he-sit-NEG"(S)he is not sitting."
Ending Suffixes
The final position in the verb complex can accommodate any one of several mixed purpose markers.[70]
Purpose
Suffix
Dynamic-Finite
-ит (-jt')
Stative-Finite
-п (-p')
Conditional
-р (-r)
Emphatic
-еи (-aj)
Interrogative
-ма (-ma)
Subjunctive
-аа(и)т//-заа(и)т (-aajt'//-zaajt')
The imperative takes a few possible forms, depending upon the type of verb.  Dynamic verbs form the imperative by the addition of agreement suffixes to a bare verb stem; intransitives include the subject and indirect object makers, whereas transitives include the direct object and absolutive.  Thus[74]
шәихәаԥшš˚-jә́-x˚a-pšyou:PL-him-lookшәихәаԥшš˚-jә́-x˚a-pšyou:PL-him-look"(you pl) look at him!"
Stative verbs form the imperative simply by adding the durative suffix -z to the verb stem.  Thus[74]
Уҟаз!wә́-q’a-zbe-DURУҟаз!wә́-q’a-zbe-DUR"be!"
Abkhaz lacks diathetic opposition, and as such there is no true passive voice distinction.[75]
Nouns[edit]
Like verbs, Abkhaz nouns are formed by the addition of various prefixes and suffixes to a static noun stem.[59]  Noun stems can be derived according to several different processes, including compounding, reduplication, or the addition of a derivational affix.[76]
The affixes mark number, definiteness and possession, as well as some case-like elements.[59] Taken as a whole, the entire morphological structure of the Abkhaz noun is as follows:
[Definite Article]+[Inflectional Prefix]+[Quantity]+STEM+[Inflectional Suffix]+[Indefinite Article]+[Clitic][77]
As with verbs, not all of these elements can occur at the same time.  The individual parts of noun morphology are addressed below.
Article Affixes
There is a range of definiteness in Abkhaz.  Those articles adhering to definite/generic categories appear as prefixes in the broader noun structure, whereas the indefinite is suffixed.[78]
Affix
Category
Example
а-
Generic
ауаҩы́ (awajºә́ - "person")
а́-
Specific
уи а́уаҩы (wә́j áwajºә́ - "this person")
-к
Indefinite
уаҩы́к (wajºә́k - "some person")
The absence of either article affix implies a zero reference implying universal quantifiers, or to express the total lack of a referent.
Уаҩыwajºә́дсымбеитdsəmbáøjtУаҩы дсымбеитwajºә́ dsəmbáøjt"I saw nobody."[79]
Definite and indefinite affixes may appear together in the same noun, implying that the referents are meant as a group or body.
аҽқәа́кačkºákаҽқәа́кačkºák"one of the horses."[79]
There are some semantic differences in article usage between the different dialects of Abkhaz.[79]
Inflectional Prefixes
Pronominal prefixes in Abkhaz
These are possessive prefixes which express grammatical person and noun class.[77] They come in two forms, the full and short ones. The full ones contain the vowels inside the parenthesis, whereas the short ones don't.
Person

с(ы)-
1st pl.

2nd pl.
шә(ы)-
3rd H:F
л(ы)-
3rd H:M
и-
3rd NH
а-
3rd pl.
р(ы)-
Quantifying Prefixes
These few prefixes add numeric information to the noun complex.  Often, this takes the form of a numeral.[77]
рыхҩы-ԥацәаrəxjºә́-pacºaрыхҩы-ԥацәаrəxjºә́-pacºa"their three (HC) sons"
Inflectional Suffixes
These suffixes convey either plural number or case-like adverbial information.  Plural markers are addressed further below; the other possible inflectional suffixes are the following:[77]
The third-person singular non-human possessive marker, attached to a locative or directional postposition
Locative -ҿы́ (-č’ә́) or directional -хьы́ (-x’ә́) postpositions
Instrumental suffix -ла (-la)
Adverbial suffix -с (-s), as in: иашьас (jaš’ás - "as a brother")[80]
Comparative suffix -ҵас (-c’as), as in: ҩнҵа́с (jºənc’ás - "like a house")[77]
Privative suffix -да (-da), as in: ҩны́да (jºnә́da - "without a house")[77]
Various coordinating suffixes
Inflectional suffixes can follow each other sequentially.
аҷкәы́нцәеиáč’k’ºəncºajаҭы́ԥҳацәеиatә́phacºajаҷкәы́нцәеи аҭы́ԥҳацәеиáč’k’ºəncºaj atә́phacºaj"boys and girls"[77]
Plural Suffixes
Abkhaz distinguishes singular and plural; the singular is unmarked, whereas the plural is indicated by noun class-dependent suffixes.[80]  There are several pluralizing suffixes, but the two most commonly used refer generally to the human and non-human noun classes.[80]  There are instances where explicitly human nouns take non-human plural markers.[81]
Suffix
Noun Class
Example
-цәа (-cºa)
Human
а́бацәа (ábacºa – "fathers")
-қәа (-kºa)
Non-Human
аҽқәа́ (ačkºa - "horses")
There are also several plural endings that are of much narrower use.[80]
Suffix
Example
Usage
-аа
а́ԥсуаа (ápswaa - "Abkhazians")
Collective, referring to ethnicities, groups
-(а)ра (-(a)ra)
аса́ра (asára - "lambs")
Collective, with the added meaning of animal young (in some nouns with -s ending)
-рaa (-raa)
а́браа (ábraa - "parents of the sister-in-law")
Delineating a group associated with the referent
Clitic
The clitic -гьы (-g’ə) functions as an in-built coordinating conjunction.[77]
сангьыsáng’əсабгьыsábg’əсангьы сабгьыsáng’ə sábg’ə"my mother and my father"
Noun Class
Nouns in Abkhaz are classified broadly according to a human/non-human paradigm, with the human class itself further subdivided into masculine and feminine gender.[79]  Gender is a fairly weak concept in Abkhaz grammar, and gender distinctions undergo a fair degree of neutralization in several contexts, including personal pronouns, verb agreement and possession marking.[80]  This class and gender system distinguishes Abkhaz from the other Northwest Caucasian languages.[80]
Vocative Affixes
Although there is no special vocative declension, the prefix уа- (wa-), when attached to a noun stem, can express a vocative form.
Уанцәа́!wancºáУанцәа́!wancºá"Oh Lord!"[82]
Similarly, the suffix -a can be added to a proper noun ending in a consonant to communicate respect and endearment.
Зура́баzurábaЗура́баzurába"Dear Zurab" (given name)[82]
Pronouns[edit]
Abkhaz is a pro-drop language.  Pronouns are not inflected, and verbal agreement is generally sufficient to indicate grammatical person.[83]
Person
Gender
Sing.
Pl.
1st
 
сарá

иарá
It is common in everyday speech to use a short version of the pronoun which omits the suffix -рá (-rá), although this is done less frequently with third-person pronouns.
In addition to noun-marking, possession can be indicated by adding the suffix -тәы́ (-t’˚ә́) to the short version of a personal pronoun.  Thus:
стәы́ (st’˚ә́ - "mine")
лтәы́ (lt’˚ә́ - "hers")[84]
Intensive pronouns are derived from short-form personal pronouns combined with the suffix -хаҭá (-xatá).  These have a roughly reflexive meaning.
сарá (sará - "I")
схаҭá (sxatá - "I myself")[84]
Adjectives[edit]
Morphologically, adjectives are very similar to nouns, differing only in their syntactic function.[85]  Similarly to nouns, adjective stems can be derived by compounding, reduplication and affixation.[86] When used attributively, adjectives follow the noun that they modify.  Predicative adjectives, or those derived by suffixation, precede the noun.[85] Adjectives are formed according to the following paradigm:
[Definite Article]+[Inflectional Prefix]+STEM+[Inflectional Suffix]+[Indefinite Article]+[Adverbial Suffix][85]
Inflectional Prefix
The possessive prefix r- is used to show possessive agreement.[87]
рҭоурыхтәrtawrә́xt’ºҭагылазаашьаtagә́lazaaš’aрҭоурыхтә ҭагылазаашьаrtawrә́xt’º tagә́lazaaš’a"their historical situation"
Adjective Suffixes
These suffixes are added to the adjective stem to show agreement with the noun being modified.[87]
Agreement
Suffix
Intensive
-ӡа
Plural
-кәа (-k˚a)
Instrumental
-ла (-la)
Adverbial
-с (-s)
Comparative
-ҵас (-c’as)
Irreal
-шәа (-šºa)
Privative
-да (-da)
The comparative form of an adjective is formed using the comparative particle аиҳá (ajhá - "more"), which precedes the adjective.  The superlative form is indicated by the intensifier suffix -ӡа.[87]  Thus:
аиҳаajháибзиоуjəbzә́jawаҩныajºnә́аиҳа ибзиоу аҩныajhá jəbzә́jaw ajºnә́"a better house"
иҟаԥшӡаjəq’apšʒáиҟаԥшӡаjəq’apšʒá"reddest"

Abkhaz has used the Cyrillic script since 1862. The first alphabet was a 37-character Cyrillic alphabet invented by Baron Peter von Uslar. In 1909 a 55-letter Cyrillic alphabet was used. A 75-letter Latin script devised by a Russian/Georgian linguist Nikolai Marr lasted for 2 years 1926–1928 (during the Latinization campaign). The Georgian script was adopted and used between 1938 and 1954, after that was restored the initial Cyrillic alphabet designed in 1892 by Dmitry Gulia together with Konstantin Machavariani and modified in 1909 by Aleksey Chochua.

Unicode[edit]
The Latin alphabet in Abkhaz is currently not in Unicode. Its inclusion was proposed in 2011. See also:[1]
Status[edit]
Both Georgian and Abkhaz law enshrines an official status of the Abkhaz language in Abkhazia.
The 1992 law of Georgia, reiterated in the 1995 constitution, grants Abkhaz the status of second official language in the territory of Abkhazia — along with Georgian.
In November 2007, the de facto authorities of Abkhazia adopted a new law "on the state language of the Republic of Abkhazia" that mandates Abkhaz as the language of official communication. According to the law, all meetings held by the president, parliament, and government must be conducted in Abkhaz (instead of Russian, which is currently a de facto administrative language) from 2010, and all state officials will be obliged to use Abkhaz as their language of everyday business from 2015. Some, however, have considered the implementation of this law unrealistic and concerns have been made that it will drive people away from Abkhazia and hurt the independent press due to a significant share of non-Abkhaz speakers among ethnic minorities as well as Abkhaz themselves, and a shortage of teachers of Abkhaz. The law is an attempt to amend a situation where up to a third of the ethnic Abkhaz population are no longer capable of speaking their ethnic language, and even more are unable to read or write it; instead, Russian is the language most commonly used in public life at present.[88]

Notes[edit]
^ a b The political status of Abkhazia is disputed. Having unilaterally declared independence from Georgia in 1992, Abkhazia is formally recognised as an independent state by 5 UN member states (two other states recognised it but then withdrew their recognition), while Georgia continues to claim it as part of its own territory, designating it as Russian-occupied territory.
