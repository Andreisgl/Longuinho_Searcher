End users look for the best compromise between getting close to state-of-the-art measurements and keeping low capital, maintenance and operating costs. Among the existing commercial options, SPN1 is a relatively low cost solar radiometer that stimates global and diffuse solar irradiances from seven thermopile sensors under a shading mask and without moving parts. This work presents a comprehensive study of SPN1 accuracy and sources of uncertainty, drawing on laboratory experiments, numerical modelling and comparison studies between measurements from this sensor and state-of-the art instruments for six diverse sites. Several clues are provided for improving the SPN1 accuracy and agreement with state-of-the art measurements.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
Accuracy of ground surface broadband shortwave radiation monitoringby Frank Vignola, Philippe BLANC, and L. VuilleumierThe uncertainty of broadband shortwave radiation monitoring is determined for direct, diffuse and... more The uncertainty of broadband shortwave radiation monitoring is determined for direct, diffuse and global irradiance for measurements obtained at the Payerne (Switzerland) station of the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN). The uncertainty estimates include sources that reflect realistic long-term operation conditions. The uncertainties are derived using the methodology specified by the “Guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement”. The differences between redundant determinations of direct, diffuse and global irradiance are analyzed and are shown to be compatible with the uncertainties. In addition, the signatures of some uncertainty sources are sought within the error statistics, to find out if corrections can be applied and what their magnitude is. The global and diffuse irradiance uncertainties range from 1.8% to 2.4% without correction, and are less than 1.8% with corrections. These uncertainties are close to or satisfy the BSRN targets for large signals (global:...Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Effective atmospheric boundary layer temperature from longwave radiation measurementsJournal of Geophysical Research,  2009The atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) temperature is derived from concurrent measurements of two p... more The atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) temperature is derived from concurrent measurements of two pyrgeometers, one standard pyrgeometer sensitive to the 3–50 μm wavelength range and one modified pyrgeometer sensitive only in the atmospheric window from 8–14 μm. By combining the measurements from the two instruments we retrieve the effective ABL temperature from the radiation emitted by the atmospheric water vapor contained in the atmospheric boundary layer. Measurements from five sites in Switzerland are analyzed, and salient features of the effective ABL temperature and its seasonal and diurnal variability are discussed. The measurements at Davos, Payerne, Zimmerwald, and Locarno-Monti show a stable inversion layer during the night and the transition to a convective state during daylight, while at Jungfraujoch no systematic features of the effective ABL temperature are detected because of its locations on a high mountain ridge. The four lower-altitude sites also show distinct diurnal and seasonal patterns of the ABL temperature with respect to 2 m air temperature. The largest inversion situations occur in winter at Davos, with ABL temperatures on average 5.6 K higher than the 2 m air temperatures. The amplitude of ABL variability is also largest at Davos in winter, with an average diurnal variation of 4.1 K between the early morning and the afternoon. Estimates of clear-sky longwave downward emissions obtained by using a parametrization with the Brutsaert formula can be noticeably improved by using the effective ABL temperature instead of the 2 m air temperature.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
