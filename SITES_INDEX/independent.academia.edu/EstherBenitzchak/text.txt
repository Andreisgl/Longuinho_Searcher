Cognitive Ability is Associated with Different Outcome Trajectories in Autism Spectrum Disordersby Ditza Zachor and Esther Ben-itzchakJournal of Autism and Developmental Disorders,  2014Variability in clinical expression and in intervention outcome has been described in autism spect... more Variability in clinical expression and in intervention outcome has been described in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The study examined progress after 1 and 2 years of intervention and compared the impact of baseline cognitive ability on outcome trajectories in 46 children (m = 25.5 months) with ASD. The entire group showed a gradual decrease in autism severity and increase in verbal cognitive scores. Only the low cognitive scores (DQ &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;70) group significantly improved in fine motor and receptive language scores. Significant gains in adaptive skills were found only for the high cognitive scores (DQ ≥70) group after 2 years of intervention. The entire group progressed with intervention, but only children with higher cognitive levels at baseline transferred their acquired socio-communication skills into daily functioning.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

The aim ... more Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heritable disorder occurring predominantly in males. The aim of this study was to compare sex differences in the prevalence of specific neurological phenotypes commonly described in ASD. The study included 663 participants, aged 18 months to 15 years, diagnosed with ASD. Neurological and behavioral assessments were performed using standardized tests, and obtaining medical, developmental, and familial histories from the parents. Phenotypes under investigation were macro- and microcephaly, developmental regression, minor neurological and musculoskeletal deficits (MNMD), and seizures. Male : female ratio in the ASD group was 6.7:1. No sex differences in autism severity, cognitive ability, and adaptive functioning were noted. Mean head circumference percentile for males (50.1 ± 25.6) was significantly larger than females (43.4 ± 30.2). Micro- and macrocephaly were more frequent in ASD than expected (5.9%; 18.1%, respectively). Microcephaly in females (15.1%) was significantly more prevalent than in males (4.5%). The prevalence of macrocephaly in both sexes did not differ significantly. Regression was noted in 30.2% of the females with ASD, significantly higher than in males (18.9%). MNMD was documented in 73.8% of the females, significantly higher than in males (57.1%). M:F ratio decreased in a group with two or more phenotypes (3.6:1), while male predominance was more significant in the group without phenotypes (13.6:1). Neurological phenotypes associated with ASD are more prevalent in females than in males, resulting in more complex clinical and neurological manifestations in females. Therefore, involvement of different etiologies is suggested in ASD in females.Save to LibraryEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact

Multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVAs) for each country and each sub-scale of the Autism Spectrum Disorders-Comorbid for Children (ASD-CC). Follow-up independent univariate analyses and post-hoc tests as needed. Separate samples from South Korea, the UK and Israel were compared to a sample from the US in order to examine cultural contributions, using the ASD-CC. Overall, few differences were found. Significantly, the US had significantly higher scores than South Korea on the avoidant sub-scale. Additionally, the US had significantly higher scores than Israel on the over-eating and tantrum sub-scales. No significant differences were found between the US and the UK. Cultural factors, such as views of typical behaviour, should be taken into account when examining symptoms of comorbidity in children with ASD.Save to LibraryDownloadEditCompare Citation Rank Readers Related Papers MentionsView Impact
